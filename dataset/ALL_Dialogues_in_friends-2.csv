0,"ï»¿Ross was in love
"
1,"with Rachel since forever.
"
2,"Every time he tried to tell her,
"
3,"something got in the way...
"
4,"...like cats, Italian guys.
"
5,"And finally, Chandler was,
"
6,"like, ""Forget about her.""
"
7,"When Ross was in China, Chandler
"
8,"let it slip that Ross loved Rachel.
"
9,"She was, like, ""Oh, my God!""
"
10,"So she went to the airport to meet him.
"
11,"She didn't know Ross was getting
"
12,"off the plane with another woman.
"
13,"That's pretty much everything
"
14,"you need to know.
"
15,"But enough about us.
"
16,"How have you been?
"
17,"This is pretty much
"
18,"what's happened so far.
"
19,"Flight number 457
"
20,"from Beijing now arriving.
"
21,"Oh, my God!
"
22,"Oh, my God!
"
23,"Excuse me.
"
24,"Move, move, move!
"
25,"Emergency, please!
"
26,"Excuse me, excuse me.
"
27,"There you are!
"
28,"So, so...
"
29,"How was China? You!
"
30,"It was great.
"
31,"What happened?
"
32,"- You're bleeding.
"
33,"- I am?
"
34,"Oh, look at that! Yes, I am.
"
35,"Enough about me,
"
36,"Mr. Back From The Orient!
"
37,"Come on, I wanna hear everything!
"
38,"Everything!
"
39,"Well, where do I start?
"
40,"This is Julie.
"
41,"Julie, this is Rachel.
"
42,"These are...
"
43,"These are...
"
44,"...aren't for you.
"
45,"These are for you.
"
46,"Welcome to our country.
"
47,"Thank you. I'm from New York.
"
48,"No problem. We'll use them
"
49,"to stop the bleeding.
"
50,"Baggage claim?
"
51,"I'm telling U. She went to the airport,
"
52,"and she's gonna go for it with Ross.
"
53,"Oh, my God! This is huge!
"
54,"This is bigger than huge.
"
55,"This is...
"
56,"All right, what's bigger than huge?
"
57,"This?
"
58,"Guys, you got new haircuts!
"
59,"Yes, we did.
"
60,"Thanks to Vidal Buffay.
"
61,"Because, you know, ""If you don't
"
62,"look good, we don't look good.""
"
63,"I love that voice!
"
64,"And the winner is Eva Godna!
"
65,"Airport. Airport. Ross.
"
66,"Not alone.
"
67,"Julie.
"
68,"Arm around her!
"
69,"Cramp! Cramp! Cramp!
"
70,"I think she's trying
"
71,"to tell us something.
"
72,"Quick, get the verbs.
"
73,"You! You!
"
74,"You said he liked me!
"
75,"You!
"
76,"You slowpokes!
"
77,"That's all right.
"
78,"We got the bags.
"
79,"This is my sister, Monica.
"
80,"This is Chandler.
"
81,"Phoebe, hi.
"
82,"Joey.
"
83,"Everyone, this is Julie.
"
84,"Julie.
"
85,"But I'm not here,
"
86,"you haven't met me.
"
87,"I'll make a better impression when
"
88,"I don't have 20 hours of plane on me.
"
89,"- And bus.
"
90,"- Oh, my God!
"
91,"- With the screaming guy
"
92,"- And the spitting.
"
93,"You gotta hear this story.
"
94,"We're on this bus
"
95,"that's 200 years old.
"
96,"Two hundred, at least.
"
97,"And the chicken poops in her lap!
"
98,"I'm so sorry.
"
99,"I just gave away the ending, didn't I?
"
100,"I just heard this story in the cab...
"
101,"...and it is all I can think about.
"
102,"This is amazing.
"
103,"How did this happen?
"
104,"We were in grad school together.
"
105,"We haven't seen each other since then.
"
106,"I land in China...
"
107,"...guess who's in charge of the dig?
"
108,"Julie!
"
109,"Isn't that great?
"
110,"Isn't that just kick-you-in-the-crotch,
"
111,"spit-on-your-neck fantastic?
"
112,"It's an expression.
"
113,"We just wanted to say a quick hi.
"
114,"- Then we'll see the baby.
"
115,"- Then get some sleep.
"
116,"It's 6:00 tomorrow night, our time.
"
117,"Don't tell us what's gonna happen.
"
118,"I like being surprised.
"
119,"Bye!
"
120,"- Can I get some coffee?
"
121,"- Sure.
"
122,"- Did you talk to him yet?
"
123,"- No.
"
124,"Then, no.
"
125,"What the hell happened to you in China?
"
126,"When last we left you,
"
127,"you were in love with, you know.
"
128,"I know I was.
"
129,"But there was always this voice
"
130,"inside that kept saying:
"
131,"""It's never gonna happen. Move on.""
"
132,"You know whose voice that was?
"
133,"God?
"
134,"It was you, pal.
"
135,"Maybe it was God doing me.
"
136,"You were right. She looks at me
"
137,"and sees a friend. That's all.
"
138,"And then I met Julie...
"
139,"...and we're having a great time.
"
140,"I never would have gone for it,
"
141,"if it hadn't been for you.
"
142,"Well, you owe me one, big guy.
"
143,"Your lemonade.
"
144,"I didn't order it.
"
145,"Then go take that back.
"
146,"They'll charge you for that.
"
147,"Go, go, go! Come on, come on!
"
148,"So what did you find out?
"
149,"He said...
"
150,"He said...
"
151,"They're having a great time.
"
152,"I'm sorry.
"
153,"But the silver lining,
"
154,"if you wanna see it...
"
155,"...is that he made this decision
"
156,"all by himself...
"
157,"...without any outside help whatsoever.
"
158,"How is that a silver lining?
"
159,"You have to really wanna see it.
"
160,"Ironically, these guys
"
161,"were picked last in gym.
"
162,"Hey, Pheebs.
"
163,"You know what I'm thinking?
"
164,"How...
"
165,"...it's been so long
"
166,"since you've had sex...
"
167,"...you're wondering
"
168,"if they've changed it?
"
169,"No. Although now
"
170,"that's what I'm thinking.
"
171,"So what were you thinking?
"
172,"You gave the guys great haircuts.
"
173,"I thought you'd like to do mine.
"
174,"No.
"
175,"Why not?
"
176,"Because I'm just...
"
177,"I'm incredibly anal and
"
178,"an unbelievable control freak.
"
179,"No, you're not.
"
180,"I know I'm not, but you are.
"
181,"I was trying to spare your feelings.
"
182,"Hold on.
"
183,"Ross, Julie for you.
"
184,"Anybody know a good tailor?
"
185,"You need clothes altered?
"
186,"No, I'm just looking for a man
"
187,"to draw on me with chalk.
"
188,"Go see Frankie. My family's
"
189,"been going to him forever.
"
190,"He did my first suit when I was 15.
"
191,"No, wait, 16.
"
192,"No, excuse me, 15.
"
193,"All right, when was 1990?
"
194,"You have to stop the Q-Tip
"
195,"when there's resistance!
"
196,"Sweetheart, I'll see you later.
"
197,"Okay, bye.
"
198,"That is so sweet.
"
199,"Okay. No, you hang up.
"
200,"No, you
"
201,"One, two, three.
"
202,"You didn't hang up either.
"
203,"She didn't hang up.
"
204,"No, you hang up.
"
205,"You. You.
"
206,"Sorry, I thought
"
207,"you were talking to me.
"
208,"Rachel.
"
209,"I'll just call her back.
"
210,"Hi, sweetie. I'm sorry.
"
211,"We got disconnected.
"
212,"No, you hang up.
"
213,"How did this happen to me?
"
214,"A week ago, two weeks ago, I was fine.
"
215,"Ross was just Ross. Just this guy.
"
216,"Now all of a sudden, he's Ross...
"
217,"...this really great guy
"
218,"that I can't have.
"
219,"Sweetie, I wanted you to have him too.
"
220,"I know you did.
"
221,"I'm just gonna deal with it.
"
222,"I gotta get out of here!
"
223,"I don't care what you guys say,
"
224,"something's bothering her.
"
225,"You know, I think I was 16.
"
226,"Please, just a little bit off the back.
"
227,"I'm still on ""no.""
"
228,"Morning.
"
229,"Could you close your eyes for a sec?
"
230,"No, no, no. I'm not
"
231,"falling for that again.
"
232,"What's going on?
"
233,"I sort of did a stupid
"
234,"thing last night.
"
235,"What stupid thing did you do?
"
236,"Why don't you just go get dressed...
"
237,"...then you'll be on your way.
"
238,"Bye-bye.
"
239,"How did this happen?
"
240,"I kind of ran into him last night.
"
241,"- Where?
"
242,"- At his apartment.
"
243,"Is this juice?
"
244,"And the fact that you dumped him
"
245,"because he hit on Phoebe?
"
246,"Oh, God, I know.
"
247,"I'm pathetic, I'm a loser.
"
248,"Honey, you're not pathetic.
"
249,"You're just sad.
"
250,"People do stupid things
"
251,"when they're upset.
"
252,"My God, if I had a nickel
"
253,"for every guy I wish I hadn't
"
254,"But this is about
"
255,"your horrible mistake.
"
256,"Sorry we're late.
"
257,"We were...
"
258,"Well, there was touching.
"
259,"Hey, Ross!
"
260,"What a...
"
261,"What are you doing here?
"
262,"I do Raquel!
"
263,"So he's back?
"
264,"Yeah, he's back.
"
265,"Is that a problem?
"
266,"No, not a problem.
"
267,"Good. Glad it's not a problem.
"
268,"You're gonna have to not touch my ass.
"
269,"Despite the yummy bagels
"
270,"and palpable tension...
"
271,"...my pants need to be altered.
"
272,"When you see Frankie,
"
273,"tell him Joey Tribbiani says hello.
"
274,"He'll know what it means.
"
275,"You sure he'll crack that code?
"
276,"It's funny. The last time Paolo
"
277,"was here, my hair was so much cuter.
"
278,"All right.
"
279,"But you have to promise that you
"
280,"will not be all controlly and bossy...
"
281,"...and all Monica about it.
"
282,"I promise.
"
283,"All right, let's see.
"
284,"Now, some of you are gonna get cut
"
285,"and some of you aren't.
"
286,"But I promise, none of you
"
287,"will feel a thing.
"
288,"- That's it. I quit.
"
289,"- What? I didn't say anything!
"
290,"But this isn't the face of
"
291,"a person who trusts a person.
"
292,"This is the face of
"
293,"a person who, you know...
"
294,"...doesn't trust a person.
"
295,"I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
"
296,"It's just a little shorter
"
297,"than what we had discussed.
"
298,"Would you relax?
"
299,"I know what I am doing.
"
300,"This is how he wears it.
"
301,"How who wears it?
"
302,"Demi Moore.
"
303,"Demi Moore is not a ""he.""
"
304,"Well, he was a ""he""
"
305,"in Arthur and in 10.
"
306,"That's Dudley Moore!
"
307,"I said I wanted it like Demi Moore!
"
308,"Oh, my God!
"
309,"Oh, God!
"
310,"Oh, my God! I'm sorry!
"
311,"Which one is Demi Moore?
"
312,"She's the actress that was in
"
313,"Disclosure, Indecent Proposal, Ghost!
"
314,"She's got gorgeous hair.
"
315,"I know!
"
316,"How long do you want the cuffs?
"
317,"At least as long as I have the pants.
"
318,"I just got that.
"
319,"Now we'll do your inseam.
"
320,"How is she?
"
321,"It's too soon to tell.
"
322,"She's resting, which is a good sign.
"
323,"How's the hair?
"
324,"I'm not gonna lie to you.
"
325,"It doesn't look good.
"
326,"I put a clip on one side, which seems
"
327,"to have stopped the curling.
"
328,"Can we see her?
"
329,"Your hair looks too good.
"
330,"It'd upset her.
"
331,"Ross, you come on in.
"
332,"Well, how you doing?
"
333,"I'm okay.
"
334,"That bad, huh?
"
335,"Look, I can sense when women
"
336,"are depressed and vulnerable.
"
337,"It's one of my gifts.
"
338,"Joey, when I saw him
"
339,"get off that plane with her...
"
340,"...I really thought
"
341,"I just hit rock bottom.
"
342,"But today, it's like
"
343,"there's rock bottom...
"
344,"...50 feet of crap...
"
345,"...then me.
"
346,"Tell Ross how you feel.
"
347,"Come on, how can I just tell him?
"
348,"What about Julie?
"
349,"What about her? They've only
"
350,"been going out for two weeks.
"
351,"Ross has been in love
"
352,"with you for 10 years.
"
353,"I don't know. I don't know.
"
354,"I've been with my share of women.
"
355,"I've been with a lot
"
356,"of people's share of women.
"
357,"But the point is...
"
358,"...I've never felt about anyone
"
359,"the way Ross felt about you.
"
360,"Really?
"
361,"Yo, paisan!
"
362,"Can I talk to you for a sec?
"
363,"Your tailor...
"
364,"...is a very bad man!
"
365,"What are you talking about?
"
366,"Hey, what's going on?
"
367,"Joey's tailor...
"
368,"...took advantage of me.
"
369,"No way! I've been going
"
370,"to the guy for 12 years.
"
371,"He said he was gonna do my inseam.
"
372,"Then he ran his hand up my leg
"
373,"and then there was definite
"
374,"What?
"
375,"Cupping.
"
376,"That's how they do pants!
"
377,"First they go up one side,
"
378,"they move it over.
"
379,"Then they go up the other side,
"
380,"move it back, then they do the rear.
"
381,"Ross, tell him. Isn't that
"
382,"how a tailor measures pants?
"
383,"Yes, yes, it is.
"
384,"In prison!
"
385,"What's the matter with you?
"
386,"What?
"
387,"That's not?
"
388,"Oh, my God!
"
389,"Even Mary Tyler Moore
"
390,"would've been better.
"
391,"I like it.
"
392,"I do. I think it's a 10!
"
393,"Thank you.
"
394,"My hair is very amused.
"
395,"Come on, things could be worse.
"
396,"You could ""get caught between
"
397,"the moon and New York City.
"
398,"I know it's crazy, but it's true.""
"
399,"Thank you.
"
400,"Well, I gotta go. Bye.
"
401,"Bye, Rach!
"
402,"Wait, are you leaving?
"
403,"That's what I meant by ""bye.""
"
404,"Can I talk to you for a sec?
"
405,"When the doctor does
"
406,"that hernia test...
"
407,"That's okay.
"
408,"What's going on?
"
409,"Well, okay, first of all...
"
410,"...Paolo and I are not back together.
"
411,"That was a stupid thing I did.
"
412,"If I could go back in time
"
413,"and do it again...
"
414,"...well, I wouldn't.
"
415,"Second of all...
"
416,"What?
"
417,"Is this one of those things
"
418,"where you break up with a guy...
"
419,"...I tell you what I think...
"
420,"...and the next day
"
421,"you get back together with him...
"
422,"...and I look like
"
423,"a complete idiot?
"
424,"Well, then, I think the guy's scum.
"
425,"I hate him. I mean, I actually
"
426,"I physically hate him.
"
427,"I always have.
"
428,"And you are way too good
"
429,"to be with a guy like that.
"
430,"Really?
"
431,"You deserve to be with someone
"
432,"who appreciates you...
"
433,"...and who gets how funny...
"
434,"...and sweet and amazing...
"
435,"...and adorable and sexy you are.
"
436,"You know? Someone who wakes up
"
437,"every morning thinking:
"
438,"""Oh, my God. I'm with Rachel!""
"
439,"You know? Someone
"
440,"who makes you feel good.
"
441,"Like the way I do with Julie.
"
442,"Was there a ""second of all""?
"
443,"No, I think that was the whole ""all.""
"
444,"I gotta go.
"
445,"Thanks.
"
446,"No, I swear to God, Dad!
"
447,"That's not how they measure pants!
"
448,"I was thinking of doing it shorter,
"
449,"like Andie MacDowell's haircut.
"
450,"- Yeah, I could do that.
"
451,"- Really?
"
452,"- You wanna do it now?
"
453,"- Great!
"
454,"See you.
"
455,"I just wanna make
"
456,"really sure this time.
"
457,"Andie MacDowell is the girl from
"
458,"Four Weddings and a Funeral, right?
"
459,"No.
"
460,"That's Roddy McDowall.
"
461,"Andie MacDowell is the guy
"
462,"from Planet of the Apes.
"
463,"- Thank you.
"
464,"- You're welcome.

"
466,"These were unbelievely expensive
"
467,"and he'll grow out of them...
"
468,"...in 20 minutes,
"
469,"but I couldn't resist!
"
470,"Look at these.
"
471,"Hey, Ben.
"
472,"""Just do it""!
"
473,"Oh, my God!
"
474,"Was that too much
"
475,"pressure for him?
"
476,"- Is he hungry already?
"
477,"- I guess so.
"
478,"You know, it's...
"
479,"Something funny about sneakers.
"
480,"I'll be right back.
"
481,"I gotta get one too.
"
482,"Hey, what are you guys doing?
"
483,"We're just hanging out
"
484,"by the spoons.
"
485,"Ladle?
"
486,"Will you guys grow up?
"
487,"This is the most nature beautiful
"
488,"thing in the world.
"
489,"Yeah, we know.
"
490,"But there's a baby sucking on it.
"
491,"This is my son having lunch, okay?
"
492,"It'll happen a lot, so get used to it.
"
493,"If you're uncomfortable,
"
494,"just ask questions.
"
495,"Carol's fine with it.
"
496,"Carol?
"
497,"I'm wondering, could Joey ask you
"
498,"a question about breast-feeding?
"
499,"Sure.
"
500,"Does it hurt?
"
501,"It did at first, but not anymore.
"
502,"Chandler?
"
503,"So, how often can you do it?
"
504,"As much as he needs.
"
505,"Okay, I got one, I got one.
"
506,"If he blows into one,
"
507,"does the other one get bigger?
"
508,"The One With the Breast Milk
"
509,"- Any muffins left?
"
510,"- Yeah, I forget which ones.
"
511,"You're busy, I'll get it.
"
512,"- Anyone else want one?
"
513,"- No, thanks.
"
514,"You're losing your apron.
"
515,"Let me get it.
"
516,"- There you go.
"
517,"- Thank you.
"
518,"What a bitch!
"
519,"I have a friend at
"
520,"Bloomingdale's who's quitting...
"
521,"...and he wants to abuse his discount.
"
522,"Anyone want to come
"
523,"take advantage of it?
"
524,"I have to take
"
525,"my grandmother to the vet.
"
526,"- I'll go with you.
"
527,"- Great.
"
528,"- Hi, honey.
"
529,"- Hey, sweetums.
"
530,"And hello to the rest.
"
531,"You can't go shopping with her.
"
532,"What about Rachel?
"
533,"Will it be a problem?
"
534,"You're going to
"
535,"Bloomingdale's with Julie.
"
536,"It's like cheating on Rachel
"
537,"in her house of worship.
"
538,"Monica, she will kill you.
"
539,"She will kill you
"
540,"like a dog in the street!
"
541,"So Jules tells me you guys
"
542,"are going shopping tomorrow.
"
543,"It's actually not that big a deal.
"
544,"It's a big deal to me.
"
545,"This is great.
"
546,"I really appreciate this.
"
547,"You're welcome.
"
548,"Bijan for men?
"
549,"Bijan for men?
"
550,"- Hey, Annabel.
"
551,"- Hey, Joey.
"
552,"Did you hear about the new guy?
"
553,"Nobody knows his name. Me and
"
554,"the girls call him ""The Hombre Man.""
"
555,"Hombre?
"
556,"What's he doing in my section?
"
557,"I guess he doesn't know.
"
558,"Well, he's gonna.
"
559,"I'll see you a little later, okay?
"
560,"Hey, how you doing?
"
561,"Mornin'.
"
562,"Listen, I know you're new...
"
563,"...but it's understood
"
564,"that everything...
"
565,"...from young men's to
"
566,"the escalator is my territory.
"
567,"""Your territory""?
"
568,"- Bijan for men?
"
569,"- No, thanks.
"
570,"Hombre?
"
571,"Yeah, all right.
"
572,"You were saying?
"
573,"Phoebe, listen. You were with me,
"
574,"and we were shopping all day.
"
575,"We shopped and we had lunch.
"
576,"What did I have?
"
577,"- You had a salad.
"
578,"- No wonder I don't feel full.
"
579,"Hi. What's up?
"
580,"I went shopping with Monica
"
581,"and I had a salad.
"
582,"Good, Pheebs.
"
583,"What'd you buy?
"
584,"We went shopping for...
"
585,"For...
"
586,"For fur.
"
587,"You went shopping for fur?
"
588,"And then I realized
"
589,"that I'm against that.
"
590,"So then we bought some...
"
591,"Boobs.
"
592,"You bought boobs?
"
593,"Bras!
"
594,"We bought bras!
"
595,"We bought bras.
"
596,"Bijan for men?
"
597,"Bijan for men?
"
598,"Bijan for...
"
599,"Hey, Annabel.
"
600,"I was wondering if after work
"
601,"we could grab a cup of coffee?
"
602,"Actually, I sort of have plans.
"
603,"You ready, Annabel?
"
604,"You bet.
"
605,"Maybe some other time.
"
606,"It's not the first time I lost a girl
"
607,"to a cowboy spraying cologne.
"
608,"Bijan for men?
"
609,"Bijan for men!
"
610,"And this is Funny Clown.
"
611,"It's only for after his naps,
"
612,"not before, or he won't sleep.
"
613,"We've been through this before.
"
614,"We have a good time.
"
615,"We laugh, we play.
"
616,"It's like we're father and son.
"
617,"Honey, relax.
"
618,"Ross is great with him.
"
619,"Don't look so surprised.
"
620,"I'm a lovely person.
"
621,"This is so cute!
"
622,"I got that for him!
"
623,"""My Mommies Love Me.""
"
624,"That's clever.
"
625,"Oh, hi, Jul...
"
626,"Hi, Jew!
"
627,"Okay, sure.
"
628,"That'd be great.
"
629,"See you then. Bye.
"
630,"Did you just say, ""Hi, Jew""?
"
631,"Yes, I did.
"
632,"That was my friend Eddie Moskowitz.
"
633,"Yeah, he likes it.
"
634,"Reaffirms his faith.
"
635,"Ben, dinner!
"
636,"Thanks, Aunt Pheebs.
"
637,"Did you microwave that?
"
638,"You can't do that to breast milk.
"
639,"I think I know
"
640,"how to heat breast milk.
"
641,"What did you just do?
"
642,"I licked my arm, what?
"
643,"It's breast milk!
"
644,"So?
"
645,"Phoebe, that is juice
"
646,"squeezed from a person.
"
647,"What is the big deal?
"
648,"What did you just do?
"
649,"Can people stop
"
650,"drinking the breast milk?
"
651,"You won't even taste it?
"
652,"Not even if you just
"
653,"pretend it's milk?
"
654,"Not even if Carol's breast had
"
655,"a picture of a missing child on it.
"
656,"- Where is everybody?
"
657,"- At the park. Where have you been?
"
658,"Just out.
"
659,"Had some lunch. Just me.
"
660,"A little quality time with me.
"
661,"- Thanks for your jacket.
"
662,"- No problem.
"
663,"You can borrow it, by the way.
"
664,"Here are your keys, honey.
"
665,"If you were at lunch alone,
"
666,"how come it cost you $53?
"
667,"You know what probably happened?
"
668,"Someone stole my credit card.
"
669,"And put the receipt
"
670,"back in your pocket?
"
671,"That is an excellent,
"
672,"excellent question.
"
673,"That is excellent.
"
674,"What's with you?
"
675,"Who did you have lunch with?
"
676,"- Judy.
"
677,"- Who?
"
678,"- Julie.
"
679,"- What?
"
680,"Jody.
"
681,"You were with Julie?
"
682,"When it started, I was just
"
683,"trying to be nice to her...
"
684,"...because she was
"
685,"my brother's girlfriend.
"
686,"And then one thing
"
687,"led to another...
"
688,"...and before I knew it, we were...
"
689,"...shopping.
"
690,"Oh, my God!
"
691,"Wait, we only did it once.
"
692,"It didn't meant anything to me!
"
693,"Rachal, I was thinking
"
694,"of you the whole time.
"
695,"Look, I'm sorry, all right?
"
696,"I never meant for you to find out.
"
697,"Oh, please! Please!
"
698,"You wanted to get caught!
"
699,"That is not true!
"
700,"So you just happened
"
701,"to leave it in here?
"
702,"Did it ever occur to you
"
703,"that I might just be that stupid?
"
704,"Okay, I just have to know one thing.
"
705,"Did you go with her to Bloomingdale's?
"
706,"Okay, I just really need
"
707,"to not be with you right now.
"
708,"Hi, who's this?
"
709,"Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working?
"
710,"It's Monica.
"
711,"Yes, I know I did a horrible thing.
"
712,"Joanne, it's not
"
713,"as simple as all that.
"
714,"No, I don't care what Steve thinks.
"
715,"Hi, Steve.
"
716,"How did we do?
"
717,"I tasted Ben's milk
"
718,"and Ross freaked out.
"
719,"I did not freak out.
"
720,"- Why'd you freak out?
"
721,"- Because it's breast milk.
"
722,"It's gross!
"
723,"My breast milk is gross?
"
724,"This should be fun.
"
725,"There's nothing wrong with it.
"
726,"I just don't think
"
727,"breast milk is for adults.
"
728,"Of course, the packaging does
"
729,"appeal to grownups and kids.
"
730,"Don't be silly. I've tried it.
"
731,"It's no big deal.
"
732,"Just taste it.
"
733,"That would be no.
"
734,"- Come on.
"
735,"- Try it.
"
736,"It's natural.
"
737,"It doesn't taste bad.
"
738,"Yeah, it tastes kind of sweet.
"
739,"Sort of like...
"
740,"Like what?
"
741,"Cantaloupe juice.
"
742,"Exactly.
"
743,"You've tasted it.
"
744,"You've tasted it.
"
745,"Oh, you've tasted it.
"
746,"You can keep saying it,
"
747,"but it won't stop being true.
"
748,"Give me the bottle.
"
749,"Get me the towel.
"
750,"Howdy.
"
751,"Give me a box of juice.
"
752,"Well, they switched me over to Hombre.
"
753,"Maybe it's because of
"
754,"the way you're dressed.
"
755,"Or this guy's doing so good
"
756,"they want to put more people on it.
"
757,"This guy goes through
"
758,"two bottles a day now.
"
759,"What do you care?
"
760,"You're an actor.
"
761,"This is your day job. It's nothing!
"
762,"I know, but I was the best.
"
763,"You know? I liked being the best.
"
764,"Maybe I should get
"
765,"out of the game.
"
766,"They need guys up in housewares
"
767,"to serve cheese.
"
768,"Say you do that.
"
769,"Sooner or later, somebody will come
"
770,"along that slices a better cheddar.
"
771,"Then where you gonna run?
"
772,"You're right.
"
773,"I say you show him what you're made of.
"
774,"Stand your ground.
"
775,"Show him that you're the baddest
"
776,"Hombre west of the lingerie!
"
777,"- I'm gonna do it!
"
778,"- All right!
"
779,"Now, go see Miss Kitty and
"
780,"she'll fix you up with a nice hooker.
"
781,"I don't know what to say.
"
782,"That's good because I'm not listening.
"
783,"I feel terrible. I really do.
"
784,"I'm sorry.
"
785,"Did my back hurt your knife?
"
786,"Say that I'm friends with her.
"
787,"Is that so terrible?
"
788,"- It's that terrible?
"
789,"- You don't get it!
"
790,"It's bad enough
"
791,"she stole the guy...
"
792,"...who may be the person
"
793,"I'm supposed to be with.
"
794,"But now...
"
795,"...she's actually...
"
796,"But now she's actually stealing you!
"
797,"What are you talking about?
"
798,"Nobody could steal me from you.
"
799,"Because I'm friends with her doesn't
"
800,"make me any less friends with you.
"
801,"You're my...
"
802,"And we're...
"
803,"- Oh, I love you!
"
804,"- I love you too!
"
805,"You guys, I know that this really
"
806,"doesn't have anything to do with me.
"
807,"But I love you guys too!
"
808,"I really needed that.
"
809,"I know that right now...
"
810,"...you really need
"
811,"to hate Julie's guts.
"
812,"But she didn't do anything wrong.
"
813,"She's just a girl who met a guy,
"
814,"and now they go out.
"
815,"I think that if you gave her
"
816,"a chance, you'd like her.
"
817,"Will you give it a chance?
"
818,"For me?
"
819,"I'd do anything for you,
"
820,"you know that.
"
821,"I'd do anything for you!
"
822,"Wait, wait, wait!
"
823,"Mornin'.
"
824,"I said, mornin'!
"
825,"I heard you.
"
826,"All right, everybody.
"
827,"I'm opening the doors.
"
828,"You boys ready?
"
829,"Ready.
"
830,"Yeah, I'm ready.
"
831,"You idiot! You stupid cowboy!
"
832,"You've blinded me! I'm suing!
"
833,"Oh, my God! Todd!
"
834,"What the hell did you do?
"
835,"Sorry. I'm such a doofus!
"
836,"I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
"
837,"My God, what happened?
"
838,"These new kids, they never last.
"
839,"Sooner or later they all...
"
840,"...stop lasting.
"
841,"What do you say I buy you
"
842,"that cup of coffee now?
"
843,"Sure.
"
844,"I just thought we should hang out.
"
845,"I mean, you know,
"
846,"we've never really talked.
"
847,"I guess you'd know that,
"
848,"being one of the two of us.
"
849,"I know.
"
850,"I probably shouldn't
"
851,"even tell you this...
"
852,"...but I'm pretty much
"
853,"totally intimidated by you.
"
854,"Really?
"
855,"Me?
"
856,"Oh, my God, are you kidding?
"
857,"Ross is so crazy about you...
"
858,"...and I really wanted you
"
859,"to like me, and I...
"
860,"It's probably me just
"
861,"being totally paranoid...
"
862,"...but I kind of got the feeling
"
863,"that maybe you don't.
"
864,"Well, you're not totally paranoid.
"
865,"When you and Ross
"
866,"first started going out...
"
867,"...it was really hard for me...
"
868,"...for many reasons of which
"
869,"I'm not gonna bore you with now.
"
870,"I see how happy he is
"
871,"and how good you guys are together.
"
872,"And Monica's always
"
873,"saying how nice you are...
"
874,"...and God, I hate it when she's right!
"
875,"Thanks.
"
876,"Would you like to go to
"
877,"a movie sometime or something?
"
878,"Yeah, that'd be great.
"
879,"I'd love it.
"
880,"I'd love it too.
"
881,"Shoot, I gotta go.
"
882,"- So I'll talk to you later.
"
883,"- All right, Julie.
"
884,"What a manipulative bitch.
"
885,"It's not bad.

"
888,"Hold on a second.
"
889,"Nice.
"
890,"I got you something.
"
891,"What's this?
"
892,"Eight hundred and twelve bucks.
"
893,"Didn't Big Leon tell you?
"
894,"It's a thousand...
"
895,"...to have me for the whole night.
"
896,"What's this for?
"
897,"Well, I'm making money now.
"
898,"I'm paying you back for headshots,
"
899,"electric bills, all that pizza...
"
900,"I love you, man.
"
901,"Well, thanks, man.
"
902,"Now I can get my pony.
"
903,"This is a little extra something for...
"
904,"...always being there for me.
"
905,"Wow, I don't know what to say.
"
906,"Wow, I don't know what to say.
"
907,"What do you say?
"
908,"I don't know.
"
909,"It's a bracelet.
"
910,"Isn't it? It's engraved, too.
"
911,"Check it out.
"
912,"""To my best bud.""
"
913,"Thanks, best bud.
"
914,"Put it on.
"
915,"Now?
"
916,"No, it should be saved
"
917,"for a special occasion.
"
918,"No, that's the beauty part.
"
919,"It goes with everything.
"
920,"When you put this on,
"
921,"you're good to go.
"
922,"Well, I've never been
"
923,"good to go, so...
"
924,"What the hell,
"
925,"why not try some jewelry.
"
926,"Oh, man!
"
927,"You are so wearing that bracelet!
"
928,"I so am!
"
929,"Any idea what this will
"
930,"do for your sex life?
"
931,"It might slow down at first, but...
"
932,"...once I'm used to the extra weight,
"
933,"I'll be back on track.
"
934,"The One With the Prom Video
"
935,"- This all looks good.
"
936,"- Great.
"
937,"If I want to call for a reference
"
938,"on your last job...?
"
939,"That's right there, see?
"
940,"The manager, Chandler Bing?
"
941,"All right.
"
942,"Let's see if you're as good in person
"
943,"as you are on paper. Make me a salad.
"
944,"A salad? I could do
"
945,"something more complicated.
"
946,"No, just the salad will be fine.
"
947,"You got it.
"
948,"Now I want you to tell me what
"
949,"you're doing while you're doing it.
"
950,"All right. Well,
"
951,"I'm tearing the lettuce.
"
952,"Is it dirty?
"
953,"Oh, I'm gonna wash it.
"
954,"Don't. I like it dirty.
"
955,"That's your call.
"
956,"So, what are you going to do next?
"
957,"I thought that I'd
"
958,"cut up the tomatoes.
"
959,"Are they firm?
"
960,"They're okay.
"
961,"You sure they haven't gone bad?
"
962,"You sure they're not very, very bad?
"
963,"No, really, they're okay.
"
964,"You gonna slice them up real nice?
"
965,"I was going to do them julienne.
"
966,"I'm out of here!
"
967,"Hello?
"
968,"Rachel's not here.
"
969,"Can I take a message?
"
970,"How do we spell Casey?
"
971,"Is it like ""at the bat""
"
972,"or ""and The Sunshine Band""?
"
973,"Hey, who's this Casey?
"
974,"A guy she met at the movies.
"
975,"What does he want with her?
"
976,"I guess he wants to
"
977,"do a little dance...
"
978,"...you know, make a little love...
"
979,"Well, get down tonight.
"
980,"I don't know. I don't...
"
981,"I don't get it! Two months ago,
"
982,"Rachel and I were this close.
"
983,"Now I'm taking messages from guys
"
984,"she meets at the movies?
"
985,"I mean, this Casey should be
"
986,"taking down my messages, you know?
"
987,"Or Rachel and I should be together...
"
988,"...and we should get
"
989,"some kind of message service.
"
990,"Hang in there.
"
991,"It's gonna happen.
"
992,"Now, how do you know that?
"
993,"Because she's your lobster.
"
994,"Oh, she's going somewhere.
"
995,"It's a known fact that lobsters
"
996,"fall in love and mate for life.
"
997,"You know what? You can actually
"
998,"see old lobster couples...
"
999,"...walking around their tank,
"
1000,"holding claws, like...
"
1001,"You have to picture lobsters.
"
1002,"Hey, you feeling better?
"
1003,"Yeah, I think that fifth shower
"
1004,"got the interview off me.
"
1005,"Do you have other possibilities?
"
1006,"There is the possibility
"
1007,"that I won't make rent.
"
1008,"If you want,
"
1009,"I can lend you money.
"
1010,"If I couldn't pay you back right away,
"
1011,"I'd feel guilty and tense around you.
"
1012,"Then why not borrow it
"
1013,"from Mom and Dad?
"
1014,"You feel guilty and tense
"
1015,"around them already.
"
1016,"Might as well
"
1017,"make some money off of them.
"
1018,"The man's got a point.
"
1019,"What is that sparkly thing?
"
1020,"That thing?
"
1021,"Yeah, it's a little flashy.
"
1022,"No, no.
"
1023,"No, no. It's not flashy.
"
1024,"Not for a goodfella.
"
1025,"Man, that is sharp! That must
"
1026,"have cost you quite a few doubloons.
"
1027,"No, it's fun, it's fun. It's kinda like
"
1028,"knowing one of the Gabor Sisters.
"
1029,"Hi, darling.
"
1030,"What's this?
"
1031,"Some of your old stuff.
"
1032,"Well, sweetie,
"
1033,"we have a surprise for you.
"
1034,"We're turning your room into a gym.
"
1035,"Wow, that is a surprise!
"
1036,"Just one question.
"
1037,"Why not Ross's room?
"
1038,"We talked about that...
"
1039,"...but your brother had so many
"
1040,"science trophies, plaques, merit badges...
"
1041,"We didn't want to disturb them.
"
1042,"God forbid!
"
1043,"So what's new with you?
"
1044,"What can you tell us?
"
1045,"- How's your job?
"
1046,"- My job? Well...
"
1047,"Did I mention I still
"
1048,"don't have a boyfriend?
"
1049,"Well, I just assumed.
"
1050,"We were so sorry to hear
"
1051,"about your parents splitting up.
"
1052,"Well, they're just separated.
"
1053,"You never know! We'll see.
"
1054,"I can't say any of us
"
1055,"were surprised.
"
1056,"They've been unhappy
"
1057,"ever since we've known them.
"
1058,"Especially after
"
1059,"that incident in Hawaii.
"
1060,"What? What incident?
"
1061,"No, no. I must be
"
1062,"thinking of someone else.
"
1063,"Maybe me!
"
1064,"Don't you have some folding to do?
"
1065,"Fold. You fold.
"
1066,"- Want a refill?
"
1067,"- I'm all right, thanks.
"
1068,"Give me a second.
"
1069,"I want to get this just right.
"
1070,"Dude, eleven o'clock,
"
1071,"totally hot babe checking you out.
"
1072,"That was really good.
"
1073,"I think I'm ready for my penis now.
"
1074,"I know what you're thinking.
"
1075,"Dave Thomas, founder of Wendy's.
"
1076,"I'm Gail.
"
1077,"I really have to go,
"
1078,"but it was nice meeting you.
"
1079,"Excellent!
"
1080,"He could have gotten me a VCR
"
1081,"or a set of golf clubs.
"
1082,"But no! He got me
"
1083,"the ""woman repeller""!
"
1084,"The eyesore from
"
1085,"the Liberace House of Crap!
"
1086,"- It's not bad.
"
1087,"- Easy for you to say.
"
1088,"You're not sporting a reject
"
1089,"from the Mr. T collection!
"
1090,"""I pity the fool that
"
1091,"puts on my jewelry! I do! I do!""
"
1092,"""I pity that fool...""
"
1093,"Hey, man! We were just
"
1094,"doing some impressions.
"
1095,"Do your Marcel Marceau.
"
1096,"That's actually good.
"
1097,"Would you look at that guy?
"
1098,"How long has he
"
1099,"been talking to her?
"
1100,"I don't know. A couple of minutes.
"
1101,"Yeah? Try doubling that.
"
1102,"It's like, back off, buddy!
"
1103,"She's a waitress, not a geisha.
"
1104,"I think she's okay.
"
1105,"Look at that!
"
1106,"She pushes him away
"
1107,"and he won't budge!
"
1108,"I'm gonna do something.
"
1109,"We'll get a condo...
"
1110,"...right on the mountain.
"
1111,"Ski in, ski out, it's great.
"
1112,"Excuse me? Are you Rachel?
"
1113,"What?
"
1114,"Ross Geller.
"
1115,"God, in your ad you said
"
1116,"you were pretty, but wow!
"
1117,"What are you doing?
"
1118,"Oh, my God, is this the wrong day?
"
1119,"I don't believe it!
"
1120,"If it works out, we'll have
"
1121,"something to tell the grandkids!
"
1122,"You sure will.
"
1123,"I've gotta go.
"
1124,"Take care.
"
1125,"See you later.
"
1126,"You're welcome.
"
1127,"- What?
"
1128,"- I was saving you.
"
1129,"Saving me from a pleasant
"
1130,"conversation with an interesting man?
"
1131,"From where I was...
"
1132,"Okay, Ross, listen to me.
"
1133,"I am not yours to save.
"
1134,"But you are.
"
1135,"What?
"
1136,"You're my lobster.
"
1137,"Are you being
"
1138,"the blind-date guy again?
"
1139,"No, you're my lobster.
"
1140,"Lobsters...
"
1141,"In the tank, when they're old...
"
1142,"...they get with the...
"
1143,"They walk around holding the claws.
"
1144,"In the tank!
"
1145,"You know, with...
"
1146,"...with the holding and...
"
1147,"Pheebs, you wanna help me
"
1148,"with the lobster thing?
"
1149,"Do the claws again.
"
1150,"Rach, forget the lobsters, okay?
"
1151,"Let's talk...
"
1152,"What about us?
"
1153,"Ross, there is no ""us,"" okay?
"
1154,"No! Listen to me!
"
1155,"I fell for you and I get clobbered.
"
1156,"You then fall for me
"
1157,"and I again get clobbered.
"
1158,"I'm tired of being
"
1159,"clobbered, you know?
"
1160,"It's just not worth it.
"
1161,"Well, but...
"
1162,"No ""but,"" Ross.
"
1163,"We are never gonna happen, okay?
"
1164,"Accept that.
"
1165,"Except that what?
"
1166,"No. No.
"
1167,"Accept that.
"
1168,"I gotta go.
"
1169,"Hey, man! Look, it's my best bud!
"
1170,"How you doing?
"
1171,"You're getting good at that
"
1172,"Marcel Marceau thing.
"
1173,"What do you say we play some ball?
"
1174,"You and me, huh?
"
1175,"Okay, that's my bad.
"
1176,"If you hated the bracelet,
"
1177,"you should have just said so.
"
1178,"Doesn't the fact that I wore it...
"
1179,"...say how much
"
1180,"our friendship means to me?
"
1181,"But you insulted the bracelet
"
1182,"and you made fun of me.
"
1183,"Well, that's the part
"
1184,"where I'm a wank.
"
1185,"I was hoping you
"
1186,"wouldn't focus on that.
"
1187,"Oh, yeah? Well focus on this.
"
1188,"Hard to argue with that.
"
1189,"Come on, man! I said I was
"
1190,"sorry a hundred times.
"
1191,"I promise, I will never
"
1192,"take it off my...
"
1193,"...wrist.
"
1194,"But if you want to
"
1195,"stay in there and be mad...
"
1196,"...you just, you stay in there.
"
1197,"You know what the...
"
1198,"I am here, on my knees...
"
1199,"...holding up these couch cushions...
"
1200,"...as a symbol
"
1201,"of my sorrow and regret.
"
1202,"Much like they did
"
1203,"in biblical times.
"
1204,"Though you may haveth anger now...
"
1205,"You're gonna grab yourself again,
"
1206,"aren't you?
"
1207,"You know, that Steffi Graf
"
1208,"has quite a tush.
"
1209,"I'm just saying!
"
1210,"It's right there!
"
1211,"Hey, guys.
"
1212,"Hi, darling.
"
1213,"You didn't bring my grandson?
"
1214,"He's at Carol and Susan's today.
"
1215,"A woman in my office is a lesbian.
"
1216,"I'm just saying!
"
1217,"Jack, look! There's that house
"
1218,"paint commercial that cracks you up!
"
1219,"- Where have you been?
"
1220,"- Emotional hell.
"
1221,"Did they lend you the money?
"
1222,"No, I haven't asked them yet.
"
1223,"Come on, Monica, do it.
"
1224,"Hey, you guys.
"
1225,"Monica has some news.
"
1226,"So listen, I'm sorry I didn't
"
1227,"tell you this before, but...
"
1228,"...I'm no longer at my job.
"
1229,"I had to leave it.
"
1230,"Why?
"
1231,"Because they made me.
"
1232,"You were fired?
"
1233,"What are you gonna do?
"
1234,"Judy, relax. This is our little
"
1235,"Harmonica we're talking about.
"
1236,"We taught her well.
"
1237,"- Ten percent of your paycheck goes?
"
1238,"- In the bank.
"
1239,"So she dips into her savings.
"
1240,"That's what it's there for.
"
1241,"She's gonna be fine.
"
1242,"- Aren't you, sweetie?
"
1243,"- In the bank.
"
1244,"If you need a little extra...
"
1245,"...you know where to find it.
"
1246,"Anything larger back there?
"
1247,"I can't believe it!
"
1248,"Would you stop already?
"
1249,"Get out of the bitter barn
"
1250,"and play in the hay.
"
1251,"Oh, you're right.
"
1252,"I should play in the hay.
"
1253,"I just dropped $400 to replace
"
1254,"a bracelet I hated to begin with.
"
1255,"Bring on the hay!
"
1256,"Hey!
"
1257,"I've got something
"
1258,"that'll make you happy.
"
1259,"Guess what Gunther found?
"
1260,"Hey, now you have two!
"
1261,"Oh, now you have two.
"
1262,"What am I gonna do?
"
1263,"How come you have two?
"
1264,"This one's for you.
"
1265,"Get out!
"
1266,"No, I can't.
"
1267,"I know how much this means to you...
"
1268,"...and this is about more than jewelry.
"
1269,"It's about you and me
"
1270,"and the fact that we're ""best buds.""
"
1271,"Is this friendship?
"
1272,"I think so!
"
1273,"Check it out!
"
1274,"We're bracelet buddies!
"
1275,"That's what they'll call us!
"
1276,"Okay, here you go.
"
1277,"Pay me back whenever you like.
"
1278,"You have dinosaur checks?
"
1279,"You get your money
"
1280,"and you learn something.
"
1281,"What's wrong with that?
"
1282,"Nothing.
"
1283,"Hey, you're a cheap-a-saurus!
"
1284,"I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
"
1285,"Thank you, I'm very grateful.
"
1286,"Hey, Mon, what is this?
"
1287,"That's my bathing suit from high school.
"
1288,"I was a little bigger then.
"
1289,"I thought they used that
"
1290,"to cover Connecticut when it rains.
"
1291,"Hey, what's on this videotape?
"
1292,"I don't know.
"
1293,"Let's put it in.
"
1294,"Over here, Jack. Okay.
"
1295,"Rachel's coming up the path.
"
1296,"Doesn't she look pretty? Jack?
"
1297,"Can you get this?
"
1298,"Oh, my God!
"
1299,"What is with your nose?
"
1300,"They had to reduce it
"
1301,"because of my deviated septum.
"
1302,"Okay, I was wrong. That's
"
1303,"what they use to cover Connecticut.
"
1304,"This is us getting ready
"
1305,"for the prom.
"
1306,"We don't have to watch.
"
1307,"Yeah, we do.
"
1308,"- Come on!
"
1309,"- It's fun!
"
1310,"Get a shot of Monica.
"
1311,"Where's Monica?
"
1312,"Over here, Dad!
"
1313,"Wait. How do you zoom out?
"
1314,"There she is!
"
1315,"Some girl ate Monica!
"
1316,"Shut up!
"
1317,"The camera adds ten pounds.
"
1318,"So how many cameras
"
1319,"are actually on you?
"
1320,"Oh, you look so great!
"
1321,"So do you! You look beautiful!
"
1322,"- Oops.
"
1323,"- What?
"
1324,"I think I got mayonnaise on you.
"
1325,"Oh, it's just the shoulder,
"
1326,"not my dress.
"
1327,"Everybody smile!
"
1328,"Oh, Dad, turn it off!
"
1329,"It is off.
"
1330,"It is not!
"

"
1349,"You know, Roy saw
"
1350,"Star Wars 317 times.
"
1351,"He was in the paper.
"
1352,"Where's Chip?

1353,"Why isn't he here yet?
"
1354,"He'll be here, okay?
"
1355,"Take a chill pill.
"
1356,"There.
"
1357,"I just told Rachel
"
1358,"that Roy touched my boob.
"
1359,"I can't go to the prom without a date.
"
1360,"I can't! It's too late!
"
1361,"If you're not going,
"
1362,"then I don't want to go.
"
1363,"Oh, I'm gonna kick Chip's ass!
"
1364,"I have a wonderful idea.
"
1365,"You should take Rachel to the prom.
"
1366,"Doubtful.
"
1367,"Jack, give me that.
"
1368,"Talk to your son.
"
1369,"All right, go on.

"
1380,"I can't go to the prom!

1468,"Oh, I mean,
"
1469,"we were really drunk.
"
1470,"I'm glad we didn't
"
1471,"do anything stupid.
"
1472,"Tell me about it.
"
1473,"Morning, Pheebs.
"
1474,"Well, my movie has been
"
1475,"officially canceled.
"
1476,"Joey, I'm so sorry.
"
1477,"You want my breakfast?
"
1478,"Too depressed to eat.
"
1479,"I'll probably eat in, like,
"
1480,"five minutes.
"
1481,"I'll fly home with you.
"
1482,"What time is your flight?
"
1483,"-What about my cab?
"
1484,"-I don't need that anymore.
"
1485,"You borrowed my cab.
"
1486,"You have to drive it back.
"
1487,"I don't wanna drive back
"
1488,"by myself. I get lonely.
"
1489,"How about if you come with me?
"
1490,"-It's a long trip.
"
1491,"-That would be great.
"
1492,"We could talk and play games.
"
1493,"This could be our chance
"
1494,"to, like, renew our friendship.
"
1495,"Are you asking me
"
1496,"to have a ""frienaissance""?
"
1497,"Sure?
"
1498,"All right, although I don't think we
"
1499,"need one. I never stopped loving you.
"
1500,"So has anybody talked
"
1501,"to Dr. and Mrs. Geller yet?
"
1502,"They left me a message.
"
1503,"They'll be here.
"
1504,"Where is the waitress? I'm starving.
"
1505,"It's a buffet, man.
"
1506,"Here's where I win
"
1507,"all my money back!
"
1508,"I gotta talk to you.
"
1509,"Sure.
"
1510,"What's up?
"
1511,"Monica and I almost got married.
"
1512,"My God!
"
1513,"That's huge!
"
1514,"Wait a minute. Why wasn't I invited?
"
1515,"And who was gonna be your best man?
"
1516,"Don't say Ross. Do not say Ross.
"
1517,"I just don't think that Monica and I
"
1518,"are ready yet. I love her. . .
"
1519,". . .but seeing Ross and Rachel
"
1520,"come out of that chapel. . .
"
1521,". . .was like a wake-up call that Monica
"
1522,"and I are moving so fast, you know.
"
1523,"How do I tell her
"
1524,"without crushing her?
"
1525,"Tell her she's not marriage material.
"
1526,"What?
"
1527,"Girls say it to me all the time.
"
1528,"And if she's anything like me,
"
1529,"she's just gonna be relieved.
"
1530,"How do I tell him that it's too soon?
"
1531,"He's gonna think
"
1532,"I don't love him anymore.
"
1533,"-Well, you don't.
"
1534,"-Yes, I do.
"
1535,"Good. I was just testing you.
"
1536,"-Hey.
"
1537,"-Oh, hi.
"
1538,"We were just talking about bacon.
"
1539,"No, we were talking about tennis.
"
1540,"Tennis is more believable.
"
1541,"Thank you.
"
1542,"Coffee.
"
1543,"What?
"
1544,"Are we gonna talk about
"
1545,"what you guys did last night?
"
1546,"What do you mean ""Iast night""?
"
1547,"Nothing happened last night.
"
1548,"Ross invited us all to watch.
"
1549,"We weren't gonna miss
"
1550,"our friends marrying.
"
1551,"Who got married?
"
1552,"You did.
"
1553,"What?
"
1554,"-Hello. We didn't get married.
"
1555,"-No, we didn't. That's ridi--
"
1556,"Wait, wait, wait.
"
1557,"I remember being in a chapel.
"
1558,"They would not let us get married
"
1559,"when we were that drunk.
"
1560,"They let you get married.
"
1561,"Most people who marry
"
1562,"in Vegas are drunk.
"
1563,"Now, I'm drunk right now.
"
1564,"I can't have a mimosa with breakfast?
"
1565,"I'm on vacation.
"
1566,"What are you gonna do?
"
1567,"Well, I guess we find
"
1568,"a divorce lawyer.
"
1569,"Well, I think, I think
"
1570,"Ross already has one.
"
1571,"Now, this one's free, right?
"
1572,"Because you paid for the first two.
"
1573,"Laugh it up, but the joke's on you. . .
"
1574,". . .because we don't need
"
1575,"to get divorced.
"
1576,"-We're just gonna get an annulment.
"
1577,"-An annulment?
"
1578,"Ross, I don't think surgery
"
1579,"is the answer here.
"
1580,"Oh, that's your thing!
"
1581,"What?
"
1582,"Your thing, that you're the guy
"
1583,"who gets divorced.
"
1584,"No, no, that's not ""my thing. ""
"
1585,"I do not love getting divorced.
"
1586,"Yes, you do. This is
"
1587,"your third divorce.
"
1588,"You love divorce so much,
"
1589,"you're probably gonna marry it. . .
"
1590,". . .and then it won't work out,
"
1591,"so you're gonna have to divorce it.
"
1592,"I'm so drunk.
"
1593,"-So what should we do?
"
1594,"-I don't know.
"
1595,"I know I love you.
"
1596,"I know I love you.
"
1597,"Where are we on the whole
"
1598,"""going back. . .
"
1599,". . .to where they have the marriages""
"
1600,"thing? I love you.
"
1601,"That's a good question.
"
1602,"Last night we let the dice decide.
"
1603,"We should leave it
"
1604,"up to fate again. I love you!
"
1605,"We don't get married
"
1606,"unless there's a sign.
"
1607,"So say. . . .
"
1608,"You roll another eight,
"
1609,"then there's a sign. . .
"
1610,". . .that we should marry.
"
1611,"Eight we get married. . .
"
1612,". . .but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 1 0,
"
1613,"1 1 , 1 2, we don't get married.
"
1614,"Sounds great.
"
1615,"Hey, we got a shooter.
"
1616,"Money, please.
"
1617,"-Ready?
"
1618,"-Ready.
"
1619,"Come on, eight.
"
1620,"Yes, yes, eight.
"
1621,"Eight, easy eight.
"
1622,"-I can't believe I rolled an eight.
"
1623,"-That was so unlikely.
"
1624,"Let's get married.
"
1625,"I guess.
"
1626,"Last night I rolled a hard eight.
"
1627,"It was the wrong kind of eight.
"
1628,"No wedding! Damn it!
"
1629,"I wanted it so bad!
"
1630,"Wanna go pack?
"
1631,"We're doing the right thing.
"
1632,"Of course we are.
"
1633,"We left it up to fate.
"
1634,"If we were supposed to get married,
"
1635,"there would be a sign.
"
1636,"Okay, you have 1 9 questions left.
"
1637,"Use them wisely.
"
1638,"Come on, Joey. You can't win
"
1639,"if you don't ask any questions!
"
1640,"What?
"
1641,"You promised me a fun road trip.
"
1642,"We've been on the road for 6 hours,
"
1643,"and you've been asleep for 5 1 /2.
"
1644,"We are switching, and
"
1645,"you are going to drive back.
"
1646,"That will be your punishment,
"
1647,"you greedy sleeper!
"
1648,"All right.
"
1649,"And until then, you are going
"
1650,"to sing to me.
"
1651,"Because the radio's broken, and you are
"
1652,"selfish, but you have a nice voice.
"
1653,"-Really?
"
1654,"-Sing!
"
1655,"I wanna rock 'n ' roll all night
"
1656,"Man, this is a long drive.
"
1657,"Are my eyes open?
"
1658,"No!
"
1659,"Morning.
"
1660,"Hey.
"
1661,"Hey, hubby.
"
1662,"Actually, I wanted to talk to you
"
1663,"about that whole annulment thing.
"
1664,"Yeah, I'm not gonna do that.
"
1665,"Okay.
"
1666,"So we'll just stay married.
"
1667,"Yes, exactly.
"
1668,"And I will make everyone
"
1669,"call me Mrs. Geller.
"
1670,"Wow, this is so amazing.
"
1671,"I really thought I'd have to
"
1672,"talk you into this more.
"
1673,"Now I'm scared because I don't
"
1674,"actually think you're kidding.
"
1675,"I'm not kidding.
"
1676,"Look. . .
"
1677,". . .I can't have three
"
1678,"failed marriages.
"
1679,"I can't, okay?
"
1680,"I am not gonna be that guy.
"
1681,"So what, we just
"
1682,"stay married forever?
"
1683,"How is this going
"
1684,"to affect you, really?
"
1685,"I mean, you fill some form out
"
1686,"once in a while. . .
"
1687,". . .instead of checking the box ""Miss,""
"
1688,"you check the box that says, ""Mrs. ""
"
1689,"It's right next to it.
"
1690,"Okay. I'm sorry, you're right.
"
1691,"You know what?
"
1692,"We can stay married. . .
"
1693,". . .because I thought that the boxes
"
1694,"were far away from each other.
"
1695,"All right.
"
1696,"Look, just. . .
"
1697,". . .please take a moment here. . .
"
1698,". . .and think about what
"
1699,"you're asking of me. Okay?
"
1700,"I am asking you to do me a favor.
"
1701,"You are asking me to be your wife.
"
1702,"And, as my wife, I think
"
1703,"you should grant me this favor.
"
1704,"That kid kicked me really hard.
"
1705,"Well, you did pull his hair.
"
1706,"-He took my snack.
"
1707,"-I'm not getting into this again.
"
1708,"All right, you know what?
"
1709,"Hurts really bad.
"
1710,"Well, I told you not to walk. Here.
"
1711,"There. There. Okay.
"
1712,"-This doesn't mean anything, does it?
"
1713,"-No.
"
1714,"How could you pick up a hitchhiker?
"
1715,"He could be a rape-- He could be
"
1716,"a rapist or a killer or something.
"
1717,"Don't you think I asked him that
"
1718,"before he got in?
"
1719,"I'm not talking to you.
"
1720,"You go back to sleep.
"
1721,"And, you, are you a rapist?
"
1722,"No.
"
1723,"Do you like car games?
"
1724,"Yeah, you know
"
1725,"the license plate game?
"
1726,"I love the license plate game!
"
1727,"I'll play. I'll play.
"
1728,"No, you need your sleep.
"
1729,"Night-night.
"
1730,"Listen. I know you wanted
"
1731,"to talk to me. . .
"
1732,". . .but I have an idea that may
"
1733,"make you wanna stay married.
"
1734,"We register. . .
"
1735,". . .and you get to keep
"
1736,"all the presents.
"
1737,"No, Ross, come on. No, listen.
"
1738,"I've thought about
"
1739,"how to tell you this.
"
1740,"The bottom line, Ross. . .
"
1741,". . .is, we cannot stay married.
"
1742,"-I don't know if that's true--
"
1743,"-Oh, but it is.
"
1744,"Okay. You know what this is?
"
1745,"This is a difference of opinion.
"
1746,"-When that happens in a marriage--
"
1747,"-Ross, come on!
"
1748,"This is not a marriage!
"
1749,"This is the world's worst hangover!
"
1750,"Ross, listen, if you do not
"
1751,"get this annulment, I will.
"
1752,"All right.
"
1753,"All right, I'll do it.
"
1754,"Thank you.
"
1755,"Hey, hey. . .
"
1756,". . .is there any such thing
"
1757,"as an annulment shower?
"
1758,"There's the train station,
"
1759,"where I get off.
"
1760,"I have your address
"
1761,"and phone number.
"
1762,"I have your name and the fact
"
1763,"that you're a drifter.
"
1764,"So ball's pretty much
"
1765,"in your court.
"
1766,"All right. See you, Pheebs.
"
1767,"Come on, Pheebs, I can't
"
1768,"take this anymore.
"
1769,"Please talk to me.
"
1770,"Let me make it up to you.
"
1771,"Ground control to Major Tom
"
1772,"Commencing countdown
"
1773,"Engines on
"
1774,"Take your protein pills
"
1775,"And put your helmet on
"
1776,"-This is--
"
1777,"-Stop it! Stop it! No!
"
1778,"That's not fair. You know I can't
"
1779,"resist that beautiful voice.
"
1780,"Pheebs, look, I am so sorry.
"
1781,"I promised you a fun
"
1782,"road trip with your friend. . .
"
1783,". . .and I didn't deliver, okay?
"
1784,"Now I know that you think being awake
"
1785,"is an important part of friendship.
"
1786,"So I will strive to stay awake
"
1787,"for as long as I know you.
"
1788,"You can still sleep
"
1789,"at night and stuff.
"
1790,"Thank you.
"
1791,"So can we play 20 Questions now?
"
1792,"I got a good one.
"
1793,"I thought about it since Kansas.
"
1794,"Okay.
"
1795,"Is it. . .
"
1796,". . .a kind of hot sandwich?
"
1797,"Yes.
"
1798,"Is it a meatball sub?
"
1799,"That is incredible!
"
1800,"You are the master!
"
1801,"Bug!
"
1802,"-You look like you're--
"
1803,"-Don't say it!
"
1804,"Don't even think it.
"
1805,"All right.
"
1806,"Chandler, enjoy your handful.
"
1807,"Should we just get married?
"
1808,"All the signs are telling us to do it.
"
1809,"I'm sick of the signs.
"
1810,"-I'm happy the way things are.
"
1811,"-Me too.
"
1812,"-I don't want change, do you?
"
1813,"-No.
"
1814,"Then nothing changes!
"
1815,"Everything stays the same!
"
1816,"Go unpack. It's been three days,
"
1817,"and it drives me insane!
"
1818,"Jeez, relax, it's not
"
1819,"like we're mar--
"
1820,"You know, I was thinking
"
1821,"what if l. . .
"
1822,". . .unpack here?
"
1823,"All your stuff would be here.
"
1824,"Well. . . .
"
1825,"What if all my stuff was here?
"
1826,"Then you'd be going back
"
1827,"and forth all the time.
"
1828,"Doesn't make any sense.
"
1829,"Okay.
"
1830,"What if we live together,
"
1831,"and you get what I'm saying?
"
1832,"Live together?
"
1833,"There've been no signs for that.
"
1834,"Me asking is kind of a sign.
"
1835,"Yes! Yes! Yes!
"
1836,"Okay. Okay, wait.
"
1837,"Wait, wait, wait.
"
1838,"Here's your key. Here's your key.
"
1839,"Now go out and christen it!
"
1840,"Go out and come back in!
"
1841,"Door hasn't been locked
"
1842,"in five years, but okay.
"
1843,"-Ready?
"
1844,"-Ready!
"
1845,"The key broke in the lock,
"
1846,"and I can't get in.
"
1847,"Wait. Oh, my God, I can't get out!
"
1848,"-This isn't a sign!
"
1849,"-No, it's a very old key!
"
1850,"-It's an old key!
"
1851,"-Oh, my God, it's old!
"
1852,"I love you.
"
1853,"I love you.
"
1854,"Are you hugging the door right now?
"
1855,"No.
"
1856,"Yeah, yeah, me neither.
"
1857,"So did everything go all right
"
1858,"with the annulment?
"
1859,"Oh, yeah. No problems.
"
1860,"It's all taken care of.
"
1861,"Ross, thank you.
"
1862,"Do you wanna go see a movie?
"
1863,"-Yeah, why not?
"
1864,"-Pheebs?
"
1865,"Thanks, I've already seen one.
"
1866,"Okay, I'm gonna get my sweater.
"
1867,"You wanna hear something weird?
"
1868,"Always.
"
1869,"I didn't get the annulment.
"
1870,"What?
"
1871,"We're still married.
"
1872,"Don't tell Rachel. See you later.
"
1873,"What are you doing?
"
1874,"Key is stuck in the lock.
"
1875,"I can fix it. Hold on.
"
1876,"Watch out, watch out.
"
1877,"It still doesn't work.
"
1878,"I'm not finished.
"
1879,"Nice job, Joe.
"
1880,"You're quite the craftsman!
"
1881,"<font color=""#ffff00"" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net

1882,"Did everything go okay
"
1883,"with the annulment?

1886,"Ross, thank you.

"
1896,"Do you have any gum?
"
1897,"Wait! Wait! Ross, can I just
"
1898,"talk to you for just a second?
"
1899,"We'll be late for the movie.
"
1900,"There's a cab. Taxi!
"
1901,"That's great.
"
1902,"What timing! My God, huh?
"
1903,"There you go.
"
1904,"We're gonna walk.
"
1905,"It's right at the Angelika.
"
1906,"The Angelika! Go! Go!
"
1907,"You didn't get the annulment?!
"
1908,"I know.
"
1909,"I tried, but when I got to
"
1910,"my lawyer's office, all I heard was:
"
1911,"""Three divorces! Three divorces! ""
"
1912,"I just don't want my tombstone to read
"
1913,"""Ross Geller: Three Divorces. ""
"
1914,"Don't worry about that. Your tombstone
"
1915,"can say whatever you want.
"
1916,"It can say,
"
1917,"""Ross Geller: Good at Marriage. ""
"
1918,"You know what? Mine's gonna say,
"
1919,"""Phoebe Buffay: Buried Alive. ""
"
1920,"All I know is, I can't have
"
1921,"another failed marriage.
"
1922,"So you're gonna be married to
"
1923,"a girl who doesn't even know about it?
"
1924,"Woman. Sorry.
"
1925,"Okay, so I don't have it all
"
1926,"worked out quite yet.
"
1927,"Just don't say anything to Rachel.
"
1928,"Rachel is one of my closest friends.
"
1929,"But being the only one that knows
"
1930,"about this makes me feel special. Okay.
"
1931,"Okay, stop, stop! Phoebe?
"
1932,"Hey, Rach!
"
1933,"What was that?
"
1934,"Sorry. Mix-up.
"
1935,"How was the movie?
"
1936,"I haven't seen it yet.
"
1937,"You'd better hurry.
"
1938,"The Angelika! Go!

"
1942,"When I move in,
"
1943,"can I get a gumball machine?
"
1944,"Of course. Joey wouldn't
"
1945,"let you have one?
"
1946,"No, when it comes to sweets,
"
1947,"he's surprisingly strict.
"
1948,"Did you tell him you're moving out?
"
1949,"No, I keep trying.
"
1950,"And I can get out ""Joey, I have to--""
"
1951,"Then I lose my nerve and I finish
"
1952,"with ""--go to the bathroom. ""
"
1953,"He may think I'm sick.
"
1954,"I have to tell Rachel, but. . . .
"
1955,"We just gotta get it over with.
"
1956,"Next time we see them,
"
1957,"we'll just tell them. That's it.
"
1958,"That's how it'll work now?
"
1959,"You'll just order me around?
"
1960,"-Pretty much.
"
1961,"-All right.
"
1962,"Hey, man, you feeling better?
"
1963,"We have something to tell you.
"
1964,"Oh, my God!
"
1965,"You're pregnant!
"
1966,"No!
"
1967,"Look, Joe, here's the thing.
"
1968,"Monica and I have decided
"
1969,"to live together, here.
"
1970,"I'm gonna be moving out, man.
"
1971,"I'm really happy for you guys.
"
1972,"Congratulations. See you later.
"
1973,"Are you okay?
"
1974,"I gotta go. I've got an acting job.
"
1975,"Like you'd believe that.
"
1976,"This sucks!
"
1977,"I'll be across the hall.
"
1978,"And I promise you. . .
"
1979,". . .the minute Monica and I break up,
"
1980,"I'm moving right back in.
"
1981,"If you're gonna move in with him. . .
"
1982,". . .I feel it is my responsibility
"
1983,"to tell you the truth about him.
"
1984,"He's a terrible roommate. Terrible.
"
1985,"He forgets to. . . .
"
1986,"He always, he always. . . .
"
1987,"Who am I kidding?
"
1988,"He's the best roommate!
"
1989,"Hey, Pheebs.
"
1990,"Have you seen Rachel?
"
1991,"-No, why?
"
1992,"-I have some exciting news.
"
1993,"You're pregnant.
"
1994,"No!
"
1995,"Chandler and I are moving in together.
"
1996,"Oh, that's good!
"
1997,"But if you were pregnant,
"
1998,"what would you name it? Hint, Phoebe.
"
1999,"What's up?
"
2000,"Chandler and I are moving in together.
"
2001,"Oh, my God.
"
2002,"Oh, my little sister
"
2003,"and my best friend. . .
"
2004,". . .shacking up.
"
2005,"That's great. That's great.
"
2006,"Guys, I'm happy too.
"
2007,"Okay, come here.
"
2008,"Big day, huh? People moving in.
"
2009,"People getting annulled.
"
2010,"I gotta go find Rachel.
"
2011,"If you see her, give her some really
"
2012,"bad news, so mine doesn't seem so bad.
"
2013,"Something bad to tell Rachel.
"
2014,"Bad news for Rachel.
"
2015,"What could that be?
"
2016,"Can you just lay off, please?
"
2017,"My life is an embarrassment. I should
"
2018,"just go live under somebody's stairs.
"
2019,"It's not that big a deal.
"
2020,"You'll have been divorced three times.
"
2021,"You'll have a life, you'll date--
"
2022,"No, I won't. I'll be at the bottom
"
2023,"of the dating barrel now.
"
2024,"The only guys below me
"
2025,"will be Four-Divorce Guy. . .
"
2026,". . .Murderer Guy. . .
"
2027,". . .and geologists.
"
2028,"Ross, you're being ridiculous.
"
2029,"You are cute and smart and sweet.
"
2030,"That is much more important
"
2031,"than three stupid divorces.
"
2032,"Have you dated anyone
"
2033,"who's been divorced three times?
"
2034,"That's not fair. Most guys that have
"
2035,"been divorced three times are 60.
"
2036,"Nobody cares about this except you.
"
2037,"This embarrassment thing is
"
2038,"all in your head.
"
2039,"-Here, I'll show you. Come here.
"
2040,"-What?
"
2041,"Hi. My friend Ross is about to be
"
2042,"divorced for the third time.
"
2043,"But wouldn't you date him?
"
2044,"And if you wait right here,
"
2045,"I'll go get Ross.
"
2046,"Thought you were Rachel.
"
2047,"What gave me away?
"
2048,"I gotta tell her.
"
2049,"I told Ross and Phoebe.
"
2050,"She's the only one left.
"
2051,"It's official.
"
2052,"We're moving in together.
"
2053,"No turning back.
"
2054,"Are you scared? Are you?!
"
2055,"No.
"
2056,"That was my scariest voice.
"
2057,"You're brave.
"
2058,"The worst day.
"
2059,"You're finally making progress at work,
"
2060,"then your boss calls you Racquel.
"
2061,"Listen, for the first four years
"
2062,"of my work, everybody called me. . . .
"
2063,"-Seriously.
"
2064,"-I believe you.
"
2065,"It was in the middle of a meeting,
"
2066,"so no one wants to correct her.
"
2067,"So everyone's calling me Racquel.
"
2068,"By the end of the day, the mailroom
"
2069,"guys were calling me Rocky.
"
2070,"Well, I still think you're
"
2071,"very, very nice and very pretty.
"
2072,"What?
"
2073,"All yours, babe.
"
2074,"Have a seat.
"
2075,"Listen, Chandler and l. . .
"
2076,". . .are going to live together.
"
2077,"Here.
"
2078,"Oh, my God.
"
2079,"That's so great!
"
2080,"I'm so happy for you guys!
"
2081,"Really?
"
2082,"And that was so sweet of you to ask.
"
2083,"The three of us are gonna have
"
2084,"such a good time living together!
"
2085,"Yes, we are.
"
2086,"Chandler, you'll have to watch
"
2087,"those long showers you take. . .
"
2088,". . .because you know
"
2089,"Racquel can't be late.
"
2090,"He'll work on that.
"
2091,"This is so exciting!
"
2092,"Come and knock on our door
"
2093,"We'll be waiting for you
"
2094,"See? Once you know the stories,
"
2095,"it's not that bad.
"
2096,"First marriage: Wife's hidden
"
2097,"sexuality. Not my fault.
"
2098,"Second marriage:
"
2099,"Said the wrong name at the altar.
"
2100,"A little my fault.
"
2101,"Third marriage: They shouldn't
"
2102,"let you get married. . .
"
2103,". . .when you're drunk
"
2104,"and have writing on your face.
"
2105,"Nevada's fault.
"
2106,"So what do you think, ladies?
"
2107,"Who wouldn't want to date him?
"
2108,"The divorces don't bother me.
"
2109,"I'd date him.
"
2110,"But not while he's still married.
"
2111,"And you, wouldn't you want to date?
"
2112,"I'm not dating at all anymore.
"
2113,"I was only dating guys
"
2114,"that were bad for me.
"
2115,"So I decided that--
"
2116,"Good. Good. Whatever.
"
2117,"And you, Meg?
"
2118,"Well, I don't care about
"
2119,"the divorces, either.
"
2120,"But I wouldn't date him.
"
2121,"It's just that he's obviously
"
2122,"still in love with this Rachel girl.
"
2123,"What?
"
2124,"She said, ""He's obviously still
"
2125,"in love with this Rachel girl. ""
"
2126,"This is crazy. I mean, yes,
"
2127,"Rachel is my good friend.
"
2128,"And I have loved her in the past. . .
"
2129,". . .but now, she is just my wife.
"
2130,"Phoebe, will you help me out here?
"
2131,"Well, I thought you loved her
"
2132,"when you married her.
"
2133,"We were drunk! I would've married
"
2134,"Joey with that amount of alcohol.
"
2135,"You could do a lot worse
"
2136,"than Joey Tribbiani!
"
2137,"I'm sorry, but you guys are wrong.
"
2138,"I just don't want
"
2139,"to be divorced three times.
"
2140,"Now he's using
"
2141,"this three-divorces reason. . .
"
2142,". . .because he wants to stay married
"
2143,"to her because he loves her.
"
2144,"I must say, well done. Bravo, Meg.
"
2145,"Fine. If this is what you think,
"
2146,"forget about. . .
"
2147,". . .the whole three-divorce thing.
"
2148,"I'll go to my lawyer's office right now
"
2149,"and get this marriage annulled.
"
2150,"She means nothing to me.
"
2151,"Nothing!
"
2152,"Okay, now I wouldn't date you
"
2153,"because you seem a little creepy.
"
2154,"I am so attracted to him right now.
"
2155,"When will we tell Rachel
"
2156,"what actually will happen?
"
2157,"Soon.
"
2158,"I just couldn't before.
"
2159,"You saw how upset Joey got.
"
2160,"I couldn't do it.
"
2161,"She's my best friend.
"
2162,"Joey's my best friend.
"
2163,"I'm not your best friend?
"
2164,"You just said--!
"
2165,"Of course, you're my best friend.
"
2166,"Would you tell Rachel?
"
2167,"All right. At least I'm prepared.
"
2168,"Oh, yes.
"
2169,"-They're not for you. Are you upset?
"
2170,"-I am now.
"
2171,"Hey, roomie.
"
2172,"Okay, bye.
"
2173,"There's something important
"
2174,"I have to tell you.
"
2175,"Are you pregnant?
"
2176,"No, but I'm throwing this shirt away.
"
2177,"I think there was a little
"
2178,"misunderstanding before.
"
2179,"When I said that Chandler and I
"
2180,"wanted to live together. . .
"
2181,". . .we meant alone together.
"
2182,"Oh, my God. That's funny.
"
2183,"I can't believe I did that.
"
2184,"No, sweetie. You know what?
"
2185,"This is my fault.
"
2186,"I wasn't clear.
"
2187,"I'm really sorry.
"
2188,"Listen, you take as much time
"
2189,"as you need to move out, okay?
"
2190,"There's absolutely no rush.
"
2191,"Okay.
"
2192,"Don't you want a cookie?
"
2193,"Sure.
"
2194,"Thanks.
"
2195,"Do you need a tissue?
"
2196,"-Where did you get these?
"
2197,"-I made them.
"
2198,"Oh, God, they're so yummy!
"
2199,"It's gonna be weird when I come home
"
2200,"and you're not here.
"
2201,"No more Joey and Chan's.
"
2202,"No more J and C's.
"
2203,"Want to go to Joey and Chandler's?
"
2204,"Can't. It's not there.
"
2205,"I'll be across the hall.
"
2206,"We can still do all the same stuff.
"
2207,"We won't be able to have
"
2208,"those long talks at night. . .
"
2209,". . .about our feelings and the future.
"
2210,"Not once did we do that.
"
2211,"I told Rachel that it's just
"
2212,"gonna be the two of us.
"
2213,"Oh, yeah? Well, how'd she take it?
"
2214,"Really well.
"
2215,"Surprisingly well.
"
2216,"She didn't cry.
"
2217,"She wasn't angry or sad.
"
2218,"And you're upset because you
"
2219,"didn't make your best friend cry?
"
2220,"All I'm asking for is
"
2221,"a little emotion.
"
2222,"Is that too much to ask
"
2223,"after six years?
"
2224,"What, are Rachel and I
"
2225,"not as close as you guys?
"
2226,"I mean, did we not have as much fun?
"
2227,"Don't I deserve a few tears?
"
2228,"When we told Joey,
"
2229,"he cried his eyes out.
"
2230,"I did not cry my eyes out!
"
2231,"Come on, it's like the end of an era.
"
2232,"No more J-Man and Channy's!
"
2233,"Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?
"
2234,"You got married again?
"
2235,"Yes.
"
2236,"So that's your second marriage
"
2237,"in two years?
"
2238,"Yes. Second in two years.
"
2239,"Third, overall.
"
2240,"I have been a divorce attorney
"
2241,"for 23 years. . .
"
2242,". . .and never have I had
"
2243,"so much business from one client.
"
2244,"Why don't you tell me what happened?
"
2245,"Basically, Rachel and I were
"
2246,"in Vegas, and we got drunk.
"
2247,"I'm sorry, is this the same Rachel
"
2248,"whose name you said. . .
"
2249,". . .at the altar
"
2250,"in the second marriage?
"
2251,"Yes, yes, yes.
"
2252,"But I do not love her.
"
2253,"That's better then.
"
2254,"This was just a drunken mistake,
"
2255,"and I need to get it annulled.
"
2256,"I see.
"
2257,"Have you considered therapy?
"
2258,"I think just the annulment for today.
"
2259,"-There are some forms to fill out.
"
2260,"-Easy.
"
2261,"We'll need witnesses who can testify
"
2262,"that you were not of sound mind.
"
2263,"No problem.
"
2264,"We'll need you and Rachel
"
2265,"to testify before a judge.
"
2266,"There's no way to do this without her?
"
2267,"Because I kind of already told her
"
2268,"it was taken care of.
"
2269,"Of course you did.
"
2270,"Look, you can't get an annulment
"
2271,"unless you and Rachel are both there.
"
2272,"What about someone
"
2273,"who looks like Rachel?
"
2274,"I will think about the therapy.
"
2275,"So I was thinking that maybe we
"
2276,"should start dividing up our stuff.
"
2277,"Okay.
"
2278,"No point in dragging it out.
"
2279,"Dragging out the long process
"
2280,"of you moving out. . .
"
2281,". . .and us not living together anymore.
"
2282,"What about this? Who gets this?
"
2283,"I don't know if I want it because
"
2284,"it might be too many memories.
"
2285,"-What is that?
"
2286,"-I don't know.
"
2287,"How about this?
"
2288,"I want you to have the big plate.
"
2289,"Wow, Monica, thanks.
"
2290,"I love this plate.
"
2291,"Something to remember me by.
"
2292,"Mon, you're not dying.
"
2293,"I'm just moving out.
"
2294,"We're gonna see each other
"
2295,"all the time.
"
2296,"But still, it's a big change.
"
2297,"The end of an era, you might say.
"
2298,"Are you okay? You're not blinking.
"
2299,"I'm fine. I was thinking about
"
2300,"how it's an end of an era.
"
2301,"Oh, all right.
"
2302,"But I gotta say, I don't think
"
2303,"six years counts as an era.
"
2304,"An era is defined as
"
2305,"a significant period of time.
"
2306,"It was significant for me.
"
2307,"Maybe it wasn't significant to you!
"
2308,"-What is the matter with you?
"
2309,"-What is the matter with you?!
"
2310,"Why aren't you more upset?
"
2311,"Aren't you gonna be sad
"
2312,"that we're not living together?
"
2313,"Aren't you gonna miss me at all?
"
2314,"Monica, all right.
"
2315,"But don't get mad at me.
"
2316,"It's just a little hard to believe.
"
2317,"What's hard to believe?
"
2318,"I mean, it's you guys.
"
2319,"You do this kind of stuff, you know?
"
2320,"You were gonna get married in Vegas,
"
2321,"and then you backed out.
"
2322,"I'm not upset because I don't see you
"
2323,"going through with it. I'm sorry.
"
2324,"It's going to happen.
"
2325,"Chandler will move in here.
"
2326,"-But l--
"
2327,"-I know, just let me finish, okay?
"
2328,"This isn't something that we just
"
2329,"impulsively decided to do in Vegas.
"
2330,"This is something
"
2331,"that we both really want.
"
2332,"And it is going to happen.
"
2333,"It is?
"
2334,"Really?
"
2335,"Yeah, sweetie.
"
2336,"You mean, we're not gonna
"
2337,"live together anymore?
"
2338,"Oh, my God.
"
2339,"I'm gonna miss you so much.
"
2340,"I'm gonna miss you.
"
2341,"I mean, it's the end of an era!
"
2342,"I know!
"
2343,"-Okay, bye.
"
2344,"-Oh, no.
"
2345,"So did you get the annulment?
"
2346,"I couldn't.
"
2347,"I knew it. Because you love Rachel.
"
2348,"It's not that.
"
2349,"Annulments are more complicated--
"
2350,"Complicated because of the love.
"
2351,"I do not love Rachel.
"
2352,"I'm telling her
"
2353,"about the whole thing. . .
"
2354,". . .so we can get this marriage
"
2355,"annulled as fast as possible.
"
2356,"Would I do that if I loved her?
"
2357,"I've never been more convinced
"
2358,"of your love for her.
"
2359,"I do not have feelings
"
2360,"for Rachel, okay?
"
2361,"Oh, what's wrong?
"
2362,"Monica and Chandler are
"
2363,"moving in here. . .
"
2364,". . .and I have to move out
"
2365,"and everything is changing.
"
2366,"Oh, my God, come here, come here.
"
2367,"It's okay.
"
2368,"Everything's gonna be okay.
"
2369,"Thank you.
"
2370,"Of course.
"
2371,"So Ross and Rachel got married.
"
2372,"Monica and Chandler
"
2373,"almost got married.
"
2374,"You think we should hook up?
"
2375,"Oh, we do.
"
2376,"But not just yet.
"
2377,"Really? Well, when?
"
2378,"Well, first Chandler and Monica
"

"

"
2439,"-You didn't tell her, did you?
"

"
2441,"Because you're in love with her.
"
2442,"I am not in love with her. She was

"
2444,"If she knew we were still married,

"
2448,"You ""comforted her""?
"
2449,"Nothing.

"
2473,"What? It doesn't mean

2510,"""What an interesting idea. Let's
"
2511,"discuss it before we reject it. ""
"
2512,"I'm sorry.
"
2513,"Interesting idea. But no.
"
2514,"So that's it?
"
2515,"I just don't think arcade games
"
2516,"go in a beautiful guest room. . .
"
2517,". . .filled with antiques.
"
2518,"Which is why Asteroids is
"
2519,"perfect. It's the oldest game.
"
2520,"What's wrong with
"
2521,"a beautiful guest room?
"
2522,"I'm not against it.
"
2523,"Especially since everybody we know
"
2524,"lives about 30 seconds away.
"
2525,"Are you mocking me?
"
2526,"No, I'm not mocking you
"
2527,"or your beautiful guest room.

"
2565,"He's got this great place he needs

"
2567,"Great! I'd love to live at Warren's.
"
2568,"I love Warren!
"
2569,"-Thank you!
"
2570,"-Don't thank me.
"
2571,"Thank the volcano that erupted
"
2572,"thousands of years ago. . .
"
2573,". . .killing, but perfectly preserving,
"
2574,"an entire civilization.

2575,"Here's Warren's number.
"
2576,"This is great. I'm gonna
"
2577,"call him right now! Thank you!
"
2578,"Okay, you go call him.
"
2579,"I saw it.
"
2580,"What are you talking about?
"
2581,"I'm talking about what you already
"
2582,"know but won't admit.
"
2583,"You love her again. You re-love her.
"
2584,"I do not re-love her.
"
2585,"I can't believe
"
2586,"you won't just admit it.
"
2587,"Promise me
"
2588,"you won't do anything stupid.
"
2589,"We're just friends now.
"
2590,"Why would I do anything stupid?
"
2591,"The apartment
"
2592,"is already subletted.
"
2593,"It's hopeless.
"
2594,"I'll never find anything.
"
2595,"Live with me.
"
2596,"-What?
"
2597,"-What?!
"
2598,"What?
"
2599,"Are you serious?
"
2600,"I would love to live with you.
"
2601,"That's great. Thank you.
"
2602,"I'm just glad I could help you out.
"
2603,"Wow, I'm so happy for you guys.
"
2604,"This is so, so, not stupid.
"
2605,"Ross, you have no idea
"
2606,"what this means to me.
"
2607,"I was gonna be homeless.
"
2608,"You just saved me. You're my hero.
"
2609,"Hero? I don't know.
"
2610,"Well, all right.
"
2611,"I have to go tell Monica
"
2612,"what a wonderful brother she has.
"
2613,"Oh, please.
"
2614,"You're gonna say things now,
"
2615,"aren't you?
"
2616,"No. No, I won't.
"
2617,"But I should tell you this.
"
2618,"The same thing happened to my
"
2619,"roommate, Denise.
"
2620,"She moved in with a guy
"
2621,"who was secretly married to her.
"
2622,"He said he didn't love her, but he
"
2623,"really did. And it just blew up.
"
2624,"And that's how she ended up
"
2625,"living with me.
"
2626,"Okay, that's a lie.
"
2627,"Listen, I'm sorry about before.
"
2628,"I don't need a game room.
"
2629,"I only played those games because I
"
2630,"couldn't get girls. Now I can get--
"
2631,"Now I have you.
"
2632,"No, not that I think I have you. . .
"
2633,". . .or think of you as property
"
2634,"in any sort of way. I see women. . . .
"
2635,"Stop it, Chandler.
"
2636,"I'm sorry too.
"
2637,"-Really?
"
2638,"-Yeah. Oh, yes.
"
2639,"We can think of something
"
2640,"to do with the room together.
"
2641,"Great idea. We can easily think of
"
2642,"a way for us both to enjoy the room.
"
2643,"Totally.
"
2644,"-We don't have to decide now.
"
2645,"-Good.
"
2646,"Let's think about changes
"
2647,"we can make in the living room.
"
2648,"Changes?
"
2649,"We'll have to move some
"
2650,"furniture to make room for my chair.
"
2651,"You're bringing the Barcalounger
"
2652,"over here?
"
2653,"Is that a problem?
"
2654,"It's just that they're a set
"
2655,"and should stay together.
"
2656,"That's cool.
"
2657,"I'll bring them both over.
"
2658,"You're taking them away
"
2659,"from their home.
"
2660,"I get it. I get nothing. Nothing
"
2661,"here is mine. Everything is yours.
"
2662,"I'll get up in the morning, put on
"
2663,"your clothes and go off to work!
"
2664,"Yeah, that's it. Everything
"
2665,"will be mine. Nothing will be yours.
"
2666,"I'm talking about the Barcalounger.
"
2667,"It doesn't match.
"
2668,"Where will it go?
"
2669,"In the game room!
"
2670,"It is not my fault your
"
2671,"chairs are incredibly ugly.
"
2672,"That's fine.
"
2673,"I won't bring the chairs.
"
2674,"I won't bring anything!
"
2675,"I wouldn't want to ruin the ambiance
"
2676,"over here at grandma's place!
"
2677,"Everything on your application
"
2678,"looks really good.
"
2679,"Just one last question.
"
2680,"Will your friends be over here,
"
2681,"partying and hanging out?
"
2682,"Don't worry.
"
2683,"I'm not a party girl.
"
2684,"Don't just be blurting stuff out.
"
2685,"I want you to really think
"
2686,"about your answers.
"
2687,"Call off the roommate search.
"
2688,"Hi. I'll be living here.
"
2689,"Ignore him. He's just some
"
2690,"guy who wants the apartment.
"
2691,"But he's not going to get it.
"
2692,"You took down the shower curtain?
"
2693,"That thing was a hazard!
"
2694,"I'm very safety conscious.
"
2695,"I was just clearing some space
"
2696,"for your stuff.
"
2697,"Thanks.
"
2698,"But listen, Monica and Chandler had a
"
2699,"big fight and they're not moving in.
"
2700,"What do you mean, not moving in?
"
2701,"They're still moving in, right?
"
2702,"No, they just had a big blowout
"
2703,"over what to do with my room.
"
2704,"Over a stupid room?
"
2705,"I feel kind of bad for them, but now
"
2706,"I don't have to move in here!
"
2707,"Oh, no. Yeah,
"
2708,"that part's great.
"
2709,"What's all this
"
2710,"about you guys fighting?
"
2711,"Is this really over a room?
"
2712,"That is so silly.
"
2713,"We can handle this.
"
2714,"Apparently not.
"
2715,"And I can't stand by and watch
"
2716,"two people I care about so much. . .
"
2717,". . .be hurt by something
"
2718,"that is so silly.
"
2719,"Enough of the silliness.
"
2720,"Tell her to stop being silly.
"
2721,"Two very good points.
"
2722,"I've known you both a long time.
"
2723,"And I've never seen either of you
"
2724,"one-millionth as happy. . .
"
2725,". . .as you've been
"
2726,"since you got together.
"
2727,"Do you really want
"
2728,"to throw that all away over a room?
"
2729,"That is so silly.
"
2730,"What's more important, love. . .
"
2731,". . .or silliness?
"
2732,"Well, we are fond of the silliness.
"
2733,"But we also have a soft spot
"
2734,"for the love.
"
2735,"-Love is the best medicine.
"
2736,"-That's ""Iaughter. ""
"
2737,"-Why do you do it?
"
2738,"-I don't know.
"
2739,"Now, Chandler, you want
"
2740,"to live with Monica, right?
"
2741,"Yeah, I do.
"
2742,"And, Mon, you want
"
2743,"to live with Chandler?
"
2744,"Yes.
"
2745,"A verbal contract is binding
"
2746,"in the state of New York!
"
2747,"So I understand you're
"
2748,"looking for a place?
"
2749,"No, I'm staying put.
"
2750,"I was going to offer you
"
2751,"my apartment.
"
2752,"Why? Where you going?
"
2753,"I don't know.
"
2754,"You won't believe it.
"
2755,"Monica and Chandler are
"
2756,"moving in again.
"
2757,"That's great news, right?
"
2758,"I mean, for them, right?
"
2759,"But on the bright side,
"
2760,"we get to be roommates again.
"
2761,"Yeah. You know, about that. . . .
"
2762,"I really appreciate your offer
"
2763,"to let me move in and everything. . .
"
2764,". . .but don't you think
"
2765,"it'll be weird?
"
2766,"Why? Why would it. . . .
"
2767,"Why would it be weird?
"
2768,"Well, you know,
"
2769,"because of us.
"
2770,"Because of our history.
"
2771,"No!
"
2772,"No, no!
"
2773,"It would only be weird
"
2774,"if we were still in ""that place. ""
"
2775,"Are you still in that place?
"
2776,"No, not at all.
"
2777,"Good. Me neither.
"
2778,"So it's not a problem.
"
2779,"We're just two friends
"
2780,"who happen to be roommates.
"
2781,"Okay, but eventually
"
2782,"you and I will be dating.
"
2783,"Really? We are?
"
2784,"Yeah. I'll have a boyfriend
"
2785,"and you'll have a girlfriend.
"
2786,"That'd be great.
"
2787,"But if you think it'll be okay,
"
2788,"we'll just work out a system.
"
2789,"It'll be like in college.
"
2790,"I'll hang a sign on the door:
"
2791,"""Come back later.
"
2792,"I'm getting lucky. ""
"
2793,"Yeah, I didn't think of that.
"
2794,"So are you sure about
"
2795,"this whole moving-in thing?
"
2796,"It's a really big step.
"
2797,"And what's the rush?
"
2798,"That's very funny.
"
2799,"He's being silly because
"
2800,"he knows we enjoy the silliness.
"
2801,"No, I'm serious.
"
2802,"Think about it. You move in.
"
2803,"You start fighting over game rooms.
"
2804,"Next thing you know, you break up.
"
2805,"It was just a stupid fight
"
2806,"about a room.
"
2807,"There are no stupid fights!
"
2808,"This isn't about the room.
"
2809,"This is about
"
2810,"what the room represents.
"
2811,"And unfortunately,
"
2812,"this room could destroy you!
"
2813,"-I'm not so worried.
"
2814,"-Me neither.
"
2815,"Fine. It's your life!
"
2816,"I just don't want
"
2817,"to see you break up.
"
2818,"Which you will do
"
2819,"if you move in together.
"
2820,"But if that's what you want,
"
2821,"there's nothing I can do.
"
2822,"Don't do it!
"
2823,"-You still want to move in together?
"
2824,"-Of course.
"
2825,"Ross didn't scare you?
"
2826,"Scared me out of wanting
"
2827,"to live with him.
"
2828,"-I gotta show you something.
"
2829,"-Okay.
"
2830,"Oh, my God!
"
2831,"Someone's killed Square Man!
"
2832,"The Barcalounger can go here.
"
2833,"You can see the TV, and it's still
"
2834,"walking distance to the kitchen.
"
2835,"Oh, that's so sweet.
"
2836,"I want to show you
"
2837,"something too.
"

"
2863,"It's great they worked things out.
"
2864,"There's no breaking them up,

2865,"is there?
"
2866,"Can I borrow the key to your house
"
2867,"so I can go make a copy?
"
2868,"-Here.
"
2869,"-Thank you.
"
2870,"Are you sure? Once I make
"
2871,"a copy, there's no turning back.
"
2872,"Yeah, I'm sure. Now get out
"
2873,"of here before I change my mind.
"
2874,"You think moving in
"
2875,"with Rachel is a good idea?
"
2876,"I've been back and forth.
"
2877,"Well, maybe you should go back.
"
2878,"She moves in,
"
2879,"and before you know it. . .
"
2880,". . .you're right where you don't
"
2881,"want to be, back together.
"
2882,"I don't think so. She's already
"
2883,"talking about dating other guys.
"
2884,"That's not going to work out.
"
2885,"She'll come home all weepy. . .
"
2886,". . .and you'll be telling her, ""Oh,
"

"
2888,"And then, bam! She finds you!
"
2889,"Maybe you're right.
"
2890,"Ross, she is definitely
"
2891,"gonna fall in love with you again.
"
2892,"Is that what you want?
"
2893,"Is that what I want?
"
2894,"Yes.
"
2895,"Here she comes. I'm gonna
"
2896,"make your life much easier.
"
2897,"The place was closed,

"
2900,"Why don't you move in with me?
"
2901,"Whoa, Joey!
"
2902,"Look, I know I scared you with
"
2903,"that whole naked-Thursdays thing. . .
"
2904,". . .but we don't have to do that.
"
2905,"It would be easier
"
2906,"to move across the hall.
"
2907,"Unless you're thinking about

2908,"naked Wednesdays.
"
2909,"Thursday's clearly not good for you.

"
2911,"Come on in.

"
3158,"What's wrong with you?
"
3159,"Nothing.
"
3160,"I got this blinding pain in my stomach
"
3161,"when I was lifting weights before.
"
3162,"And then I passed out. . .

3163,". . .and I haven't been able
"
3164,"to stand up since.
"
3165,"But I don't think

"
3168,"Go to the doctor.
"
3169,"No way.

3170,"If I go to the doctor, it'll be for
"
3171,"this thing sticking out of my stomach!

3181,"There's some Kappa Kappa Deltas.
"
3182,"I was a Kappa.
"
3183,"Hey, sisters!
"
3184,"Wow, we really are bitches.
"
3185,"Right. So when Rigby got his samples
"
3186,"back from the laboratory. . .
"
3187,". . .he made a startling discovery.
"
3188,"What he believed to be igneous
"
3189,"was, in fact, sedimentary.
"
3190,"Imagine his consternation when--
"
3191,"Oh, bloody hell.
"
3192,"What the hell are you doing?
"
3193,"Look, I was nervous.
"
3194,"You guys had me all worried
"
3195,"I was gonna be boring.
"
3196,"I got up there and they were
"
3197,"all, like, staring at me.
"
3198,"I opened my mouth and this
"
3199,"British accent just came out.
"
3200,"Yeah, and not a very good one.
"
3201,"Will you, please. . .?
"
3202,"Dr. Geller? Kurt Rathman.
"
3203,"I'm a paleontology professor here.

"
3208,"Monica Geller.
"
3209,"Right. Will you excuse us
"
3210,"for one moment?
"
3211,"-What are you doing?
"
3212,"-You can have an accent, but I can't?
"
3213,"Top of the morning to you, laddies!
"
3214,"Would you just please stop?
"
3215,"Yes, yes, Bombay is very, very nice
"
3216,"this time of year.
"
3217,"Hey, will you grab me a cruller?
"
3218,"Sit down!
"
3219,"Will you go to the hospital?
"
3220,"Hernia operations cost. . .
"
3221,". . .a lot probably, okay?
"
3222,"Besides, it's getting darker and more
"
3223,"painful. That means it's healing.
"
3224,"Look, I'll loan you the money.
"
3225,"Just go to the hospital and
"
3226,"let's just get that thing. . .
"
3227,". . .pushed back in.
"
3228,"Thank you, but it'd take me
"
3229,"forever to pay you back.
"
3230,"I don't want that
"
3231,"hanging over my head.
"
3232,"Besides, when my
"
3233,"insurance kicks in. . .
"
3234,". . .I can get all the free
"
3235,"operations I want.
"
3236,"I'll probably start
"
3237,"with that laser eye surgery.
"
3238,"What's going on?
"
3239,"Joey's got a hernia, but it's nothing
"
3240,"a little laser eye surgery won't fix.
"
3241,"I'm telling you,
"
3242,"if I put my hand on my stomach. . .
"
3243,". . .it doesn't hurt that bad.
"
3244,"Hey, maybe you'll die!
"
3245,"Chandler, I'm scared.
"
3246,"No, we can go together.
"
3247,"Just don't wait too long, because I'm
"
3248,"out of here sometime before Friday.
"
3249,"But I don't want to die.
"
3250,"It'll be fun. We'll come back
"
3251,"and haunt these guys!
"
3252,"-Give me them!
"
3253,"-No, they are mine!
"
3254,"-You stole them from me!
"
3255,"-You stole them from me!
"
3256,"Give me them!
"
3257,"Just wanna each take one?
"
3258,"Yeah, that seems fair.
"
3259,"We never use them.
"
3260,"Look, I really need
"
3261,"some help, okay?
"
3262,"Why did I have to speak
"
3263,"in a British accent?
"
3264,"What do I do?
"
3265,"Why don't you phase it out?
"
3266,"Yeah, phase the accent out.
"
3267,"People will think you're
"
3268,"adjusting to life in America.
"
3269,"Come on.
"
3270,"No one will even notice.
"
3271,"They're probably not even
"
3272,"listening to you.
"
3273,"They're not listening to me?
"
3274,"Of course they're listening to you.
"
3275,"Everybody listens to you.
"
3276,"Monica, do you think I should
"
3277,"try this phasing-out thing?

"
3575,"People are friendly. They wanna talk.

"
3577,"One guy advised me

3587,"and sponges and rags. . .

3588,". . .and carnauba wax
"
3589,"and polishing compound.
"
3590,"You don't even have a car.
"
3591,"I know. Once there was a dirty car in
"
3592,"front of the building, so I washed it.
"
3593,"-And?
"
3594,"-And six others.
"
3595,"There you are.
"
3596,"Yeah, she tops out at 1 30.
"
3597,"That's just in the city.
"
3598,"I get her up to 1 60 upstate.
"
3599,"Really? You got a place upstate?
"
3600,"Sure.
"
3601,"-All right. See you later.
"
3602,"-Okay. Take it easy.
"
3603,"Hey. That's my car.
"
3604,"Really?
"
3605,"Just give me five more minutes.
"
3606,"What are you doing?
"
3607,"I found the keys, and now
"
3608,"I'm just polishing her up.
"
3609,"-But it's my car.
"
3610,"-Yeah, but it's my wax.
"
3611,"Listen, I don't come to the city much.
"
3612,"I don't know if you're crazy or
"
3613,"if this is some street theater. . .
"
3614,". . .but could I have my keys?
"
3615,"Sure. Yeah.
"
3616,"I'll save your parking spot.
"
3617,"I'm not coming back.
"
3618,"-Why not?
"
3619,"-I live upstate.
"
3620,"Yeah, so did l.
"
3621,"I don't know why I was so nervous. . .
"
3622,". . .and why Frank and Alice complain.
"
3623,"This is easy.
"
3624,"Yeah, two hours, a lifetime,
"
3625,"that's the same.
"
3626,"Check it out!
"
3627,"When the babies wake up. . .
"
3628,". . .they can meet Krog!
"
3629,"That thing could put
"
3630,"someone's eye out.
"
3631,"He can do more than that.
"
3632,"He can destroy the universe.
"
3633,"They could swallow
"
3634,"one of those little parts.
"
3635,"Also, look at his smooth area.
"
3636,"That's just gonna mess them up.
"
3637,"They won't swallow anything.
"
3638,"You're too overprotective.
"
3639,"When I was a kid, my mom used to throw
"
3640,"me into a pile of broken glass.
"
3641,"-What?
"
3642,"-Glass, sand, whatever.
"
3643,"Look at little Leslie stretching
"
3644,"in her sleep.
"
3645,"Oh, it's so cute.
"
3646,"I wonder when you stop putting
"
3647,"both legs behind your head.
"
3648,"I can still do that.
"
3649,"How are you still single?
"
3650,"I thought about it, and maybe you're
"
3651,"right. Maybe Krog is not a safe toy.
"
3652,"-What made you change your mind?
"
3653,"-I swallowed his sonic blaster gun.
"
3654,"How did that happen?
"
3655,"I was trying to prove
"
3656,"that I was right.
"
3657,"And it turns out I was wrong. . .
"
3658,". . .and now it's lodged in my throat.
"
3659,"This whole time we were
"
3660,"concentrating on the babies. . .
"
3661,". . .and no one was watching Chandler!
"
3662,"You are asking the court
"
3663,"for an annulment?
"
3664,"Yes, Your Honor. Here are
"
3665,"our forms, all filled out.
"
3666,"So based on your petition. . .
"
3667,". . .you are seeking an annulment
"
3668,"on the grounds. . .
"
3669,". . .that ""Mr. Geller
"
3670,"is mentally unstable. ""
"
3671,"Fine. I'm mentally unstable.
"
3672,"And based on the fact that ""Mr. Geller
"
3673,"is an intravenous drug user. ""
"
3674,"-What?
"
3675,"-Yes. Heroin and crack.
"
3676,"Crack isn't even an intravenous drug.
"
3677,"Well, you would know.
"
3678,"Now, it also says here that you. . .
"
3679,". . . ""Iied about your sexual preference
"
3680,"before marriage. ""
"
3681,"Oh, come on.
"
3682,"Ross, please. I found the magazines.
"
3683,"And, finally, that you were
"
3684,"""unable to consummate the marriage. ""
"
3685,"Well, that makes sense since
"
3686,"you're gay and addicted to heroin.
"
3687,"You know, I'm sorry, this is insane.
"
3688,"I'm not addicted to heroin,
"
3689,"I'm not gay, and there is no problem. . .
"
3690,". . .with my ability
"
3691,"to consummate anything.
"
3692,"I'll consummate this marriage
"
3693,"right here, right now!
"
3694,"That won't be necessary.
"
3695,"And when we were dating,
"
3696,"we consummated like bunnies.
"
3697,"If you were involved in a serious
"
3698,"relationship, that creates a problem.
"
3699,"Rest assured, that relationship
"
3700,"ended two years ago.
"
3701,"Strike ""consummated like bunnies""
"
3702,"from the record.
"
3703,"Is there anything in this record
"
3704,"that is actually true?
"
3705,"Well, yes. We got married in Vegas.
"
3706,"And the names, I think.
"
3707,"Based on what I've heard, you certainly
"
3708,"don't qualify for an annulment.
"
3709,"If you don't wanna be together,
"
3710,"file for divorce.
"
3711,"That's great. You happy? Look what
"
3712,"you did with your funny, funny form.
"
3713,"What? Me? What about you and your
"
3714,"""consummated like bunnies"" nonsense?
"
3715,"And what--
"
3716,"What are you typing that for?
"
3717,"She said we don't get the annulment.
"
3718,"Don't type that. What--
"
3719,"Stop typing!
"
3720,"Stop typing!
"
3721,"""Stop typing, stop typing! ""
"
3722,"Okay, do you see what you're
"
3723,"keeping me married to?
"
3724,"Get out of my chambers.
"
3725,"Lady, here's the deal.
"
3726,"I came here for an annulment, and
"
3727,"I'm not leaving here until I get one!
"
3728,"-Would you like a night in jail?
"
3729,"-Thank you for your time.
"
3730,"That Porsche guy took his car back.
"
3731,"But you found the keys to his clothes?
"
3732,"No, I just love the way it feels
"
3733,"when everybody thinks I own a Porsche.
"
3734,"They'll think you own one
"
3735,"because of the clothes?
"
3736,"Of course.
"
3737,"Only an idiot would wear this stuff
"
3738,"if he didn't have the car.
"
3739,"That is true.
"
3740,"Yeah, but only a genius would

3741,"swallow a sonic blaster gun.
"
3742,"Oh, I've been there.
"
3743,"I am gonna go drive my Porsche.
"
3744,"You know you don't actually have one.
"
3745,"What are you doing? I'm in character.

3746,"Will you talk to her?
"
3747,"I think it just moved.
"
3748,"It's poking me.
"
3749,"We'll go to the emergency room.
"
3750,"No, you can't leave me here with them.
"
3751,"We're babysitting.
"
3752,"The babies are asleep.
"
3753,"You'll be okay on your own.
"
3754,"You can't leave me with them.
"
3755,"We're a team.
"
3756,"We're playing a zone.
"
3757,"They'll triple-team me!
"
3758,"He's got plastic in his throat.
"
3759,"We gotta go to the hospital.
"
3760,"But a doctor won't be able to help him.
"
3761,"And it's just gonna. . .
"
3762,". . .naturally pass through
"
3763,"his system in seven years.
"
3764,"-I think that's gum.
"
3765,"-I'm pretty sure it's gun.
"
3766,"This really hurts. Let's go.
"
3767,"But no! A real man wouldn't
"
3768,"just run to the hospital.
"
3769,"No! What would Krog do?
"
3770,"Why isn't that valet back
"
3771,"with my Porsche?
"
3772,"Maybe because you've got the keys?
"
3773,"-That was totally your fault.
"
3774,"-My fault? You threatened the judge.
"
3775,"You ripped the paper out
"
3776,"of the court reporter's machine!
"
3777,"That was the only way I could
"
3778,"get him to stop typing!
"
3779,"Hi. How are the Gellers?
"
3780,"Don't call us that.
"
3781,"The judge wouldn't let us get an
"
3782,"annulment. Now we gotta get a divorce!
"
3783,"Did a Porsche throw up on you?
"
3784,"It's ""Porsche-a"" !
"
3785,"Me taking care of you
"
3786,"is no problem, huh?
"
3787,"You guys feel safe, right?
"
3788,"I'm gonna take that spit bubble
"
3789,"as a ""Yeah, I do! ""
"
3790,"Let's get rid of this dirty diaper.
"
3791,"I'll set you up with a clean one.
"
3792,"I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.
"
3793,"I just have to clean that up.
"
3794,"Because, let's face it,
"
3795,"we're at Monica's.
"
3796,"I broke it. All right.
"
3797,"Well, that's just the way things go.
"
3798,"Okay. Good.
"
3799,"Why are there only two of you?
"
3800,"Where's Leslie?
"
3801,"Well, you can't answer.
"
3802,"Leslie? Where are you, Leslie?
"
3803,"Now would be a good time
"
3804,"for your first words.
"
3805,"Well, look at you!
"
3806,"You are a little bit mischievous.
"
3807,"My gosh!
"
3808,"Oh, you're a lot mischievous.
"
3809,"Well, it'll dry.
"
3810,"You sit with your brother
"
3811,"and sister now. . .
"
3812,". . .who aren't there.
"
3813,"How do you feel?
"
3814,"Let's just say, Krog will be equipped
"
3815,"to destroy the universe again. . .
"
3816,". . .in 1 2 to 1 4 hours.
"
3817,"I totally took care of the babies
"
3818,"all by myself.
"
3819,"I fed them, bathed them
"
3820,"and put them to bed.
"
3821,"And protected them from a tornado?
"
3822,"Oh, my God!
"
3823,"I know. The babies are asleep.
"
3824,"Phoebe, what happened here?
"
3825,"I did it. I took care
"
3826,"of the babies all by myself.
"
3827,"-But my apartment!
"
3828,"-Was the setting of Phoebe's triumph.
"
3829,"But the mess!
"
3830,"Is not as important as the fact
"
3831,"that Phoebe took care of the babies.
"
3832,"You're right. I shouldn't freak out.
"
3833,"This is what it'll be like
"
3834,"when we have babies. When's that?
"
3835,"Phoebe, look at this mess!
"
3836,"Honey, thank God you're home.
"
3837,"I was getting worried.
"
3838,"I picked up the divorce papers.
"
3839,"I've already signed everything.
"
3840,"I put little X's where you need to sign.
"
3841,"Little X's. Great!
"
3842,"That makes up for everything.
"
3843,"You know, you've done
"
3844,"a lot of stupid stuff too, okay?
"
3845,"Name one stupid thing that is
"
3846,"as stupid as this one.
"
3847,"How about you flew to London
"
3848,"to stop my wedding?
"
3849,"You told me you loved me
"
3850,"after I was married.
"
3851,"Wait, that was different. I did those
"
3852,"things because I was in love with you.
"
3853,"Right.
"
3854,"You're right. That's very different.
"
3855,"So let's just sign the papers.
"
3856,"What?
"
3857,"Nothing.
"
3858,"Okay, can we just sign, please?
"
3859,"Congratulations.
"
3860,"Okay, wait, Ross. Wait a minute.
"
3861,"I kind of have a little confession.
"
3862,"What?
"
3863,"Well, you know,
"
3864,"this whole marriage thing.
"
3865,"Kind of my idea.
"
3866,"Excuse me?
"
3867,"Remember how we were too drunk to
"
3868,"remember anything when we were married?
"
3869,"I didn't really wanna say anything,
"
3870,"but it just kept coming back to me.
"
3871,"We were in the casino, and you thought
"
3872,"it'd be funny to eat a lot of grapes.
"
3873,"And I thought it would be funnier
"
3874,"if we got married.
"
3875,"So, as a compromise, we decided
"
3876,"first to get married and then. . .
"
3877,". . .to eat a lot of grapes.
"
3878,"Sorry I got us into this whole thing.
"
3879,"So then if you think about it. . .
"
3880,". . .this is all your fault.
"
3881,"Yeah, don't push it, though.
"
3882,"I gotta say. . .
"
3883,". . .I know I divorce a lot of women.
"
3884,"Never thought I'd be divorcing you.
"
3885,"I know.
"
3886,"I always thought if we got married,
"
3887,"that'd be the one that stuck.
"
3888,"And it wouldn't be a secret. . .
"
3889,". . .and we wouldn't have our
"
3890,"wedding dinner at Pizza Hut.
"
3891,"Did I even treat?
"
3892,"No, it was on the house.
"
3893,"It was a newlywed special.
"
3894,"That may be the most depressing thing
"
3895,"I've heard.
"
3896,"I should get these
"
3897,"to my lawyer's office.
"
3898,"Thanks for taking care of all this.
"
3899,"No problem.
"
3900,"-I'm gonna need a copy of those.
"
3901,"-Totally.

"
4058,"Are you crazy? You haven't beaten me

4059,"since my injury-plagued '97 season.
"

"
4061,"-Yes, it would.
"
4062,"What do you say to $50?
"
4063,"-You're on.
"
4064,"-Okay, let's play.
"
4065,"The big game. Italy versus. . .

"
4067,"Look, it's the Rollerblades.
"
4068,"Oh, God!
"
4069,"You remember when we got these?

4070,"I guess you weren't there.
"
4071,"You guys,
"
4072,"we said we were gonna have fun.
"
4073,"Come on. Hey, remember the time. . . .
"
4074,"You don't remember?
"
4075,"Sorry, Pheebs. I'm just really sad
"
4076,"that I'm leaving.
"
4077,"I'm gonna miss you so much.
"
4078,"This doesn't have to be so sad,
"
4079,"though, you know?
"
4080,"Instead of thinking about
"
4081,"how you'll miss each other. . .
"
4082,". . .you should think of the things
"
4083,"you're not gonna miss.
"
4084,"I don't think there's anything.
"
4085,"Come on, there's gotta be something.
"
4086,"She's perfect.
"
4087,"I have one.
"
4088,"Okay, you can go first.
"
4089,"I guess I'm not gonna miss the fact. . .
"
4090,". . .that you're never allowed
"
4091,"to move the phone pen.
"
4092,"That's a good one.
"
4093,"Okay, Monica, anything?
"
4094,"You know,
"
4095,"does Rachel move the phone pen?
"
4096,"Sometimes.
"
4097,"Always, actually.
"
4098,"There you go.
"
4099,"Doesn't everyone feel better?
"
4100,"Not just the phone pen.
"
4101,"I never get my messages.
"
4102,"You get your messages.
"
4103,"It doesn't count if you have to
"
4104,"read them off your hand. . .
"
4105,". . .after you've fallen asleep
"
4106,"on the couch.
"
4107,"So you missed a message from who?
"
4108,"Chandler?
"
4109,"Or your mom?
"
4110,"Or Chandler?
"
4111,"Or your mom?
"
4112,"It worked! No one's sad!
"
4113,"I win again!
"
4114,"That's, like, 500 bucks
"
4115,"you owe me!
"
4116,"Man! Five hundred dollars.
"
4117,"That is a lot of electricity, huh?
"
4118,"I gotta buy some food.
"
4119,"Give me a chance to win my money back.
"
4120,"Sudden death. . .
"
4121,". . .one goal, $1 000.
"
4122,"-You serious?
"
4123,"-Yes!
"
4124,"Get ready to owe me.
"
4125,"Here we go. Ready?
"
4126,"No. . .
"
4127,". . .one can beat me!
"
4128,"That's why only the little fake men
"
4129,"are supposed to do the kicking.
"
4130,"Hi, Ross.
"
4131,"See, other people call me!
"
4132,"Your brother. Score!
"
4133,"What's up?
"
4134,"I'm here with Ben.
"
4135,"Thought we'd say hi.
"
4136,"Put him on.
"
4137,"Ben, say hi to Aunt Monica.
"
4138,"I guess he doesn't feel like
"
4139,"talking right now.
"
4140,"He's smiling, though.
"
4141,"Okay, talk to you later.
"
4142,"I think it was better
"
4143,"when you guys were sad.
"
4144,"Hey, remember the Rollerblades?
"
4145,"You know what else I won't miss?
"
4146,"""I'm Monica.
"
4147,"I wash the toilets 1 7 times a day,
"
4148,"even if people are on it! ""
"
4149,"""Hi, I'm Rachel.
"
4150,"Is my sweater too tight?
"
4151,"I'd better wash it and shrink it! ""
"
4152,"""I'm Monica. I never get messages
"
4153,"from interesting people. ""
"
4154,"I call her.

4157,"""My God!

4160,"with the first guy I find there! ""

4161,"We should get a move on if we want
"
4162,"to make those dinner reservations.
"
4163,"Still broken?
"
4164,"It sucks, man.

4165,"Your last night, and I lose the two
"
4166,"most important things:

4167,"The foosball table. . .
"
4168,". . .and $500.
"
4169,"There are other ways to win back
"
4170,"your money. How about blackjack?
"
4171,"Not my game.
"
4172,"You know what?
"
4173,"We can play a new game.
"
4174,"-It's fun!
"
4175,"-What's it called?
"
4176,"Cups.
"
4177,"-I don't know how.
"
4178,"-I'll teach you. It's easy and fun.
"
4179,"-All right.
"
4180,"-Here you go.
"
4181,"I have two queens.
"
4182,"What do you have?
"
4183,"-A 2 and a 5.
"
4184,"-You win! Fifty dollars!
"
4185,"-Really?
"
4186,"-Let's play again.
"
4187,"-What have you got?
"
4188,"-4 and a 9.
"
4189,"You're kidding, right?
"
4190,"-No. Why?
"
4191,"-That's a full cup!
"
4192,"Damn, I am good at Cups!
"
4193,"I'm not talking to her.
"
4194,"You have to take the first step. . .
"
4195,". . .because she's the one who's
"
4196,"leaving. It's harder for her.
"
4197,"Maybe you're right.
"
4198,"But she made fun of my phone pen!
"
4199,"I know. I took it hard too.
"
4200,"I feel bad about what happened--
"
4201,"-What are you doing?
"
4202,"-I'm unpacking.
"
4203,"I'm not moving.
"
4204,"Is that picture straight?
"
4205,"It needs to go about 20 blocks
"
4206,"to the left.
"
4207,"You're the one who wants this
"
4208,"big change and move in with Chandler!
"
4209,"You should go!
"
4210,"Why do I have to leave?
"
4211,"-It's my apartment!
"
4212,"-It's mine too! What else you got?
"
4213,"How about: You're moving!
"
4214,"This is ridiculous.
"
4215,"We should be packing you!
"
4216,"-Hey, how you guys doing?
"
4217,"-Great. Monica's moving.
"
4218,"I am not!
"
4219,"Really? How come all your
"
4220,"stuff is in this box?
"
4221,"Okay, you guys,
"
4222,"I think I know what's going on here!
"
4223,"You guys? Stop!
"
4224,"I know you're acting mad because
"
4225,"it'll make it easier to leave.
"
4226,"But deep down, you're really sad.
"
4227,"Deep, deep down.
"
4228,"-No, Phoebe, I am mad!
"
4229,"-Well, deep down!
"
4230,"I'm just mad.
"
4231,"Then keep running.
"
4232,"You win!
"
4233,"-What did you have?
"
4234,"-Nothing beats. . .
"
4235,". . .a three and a six.
"
4236,"That, my friend, is ""D Cup. ""
"
4237,"How much have you won so far?
"
4238,"-700.
"
4239,"-Not 700 exactly?
"
4240,"Double it.
"
4241,"In Cups, once you get $700,
"
4242,"you have to double it.
"
4243,"I didn't make up the rules.
"
4244,"Now, after you receive the doubling
"
4245,"bonus, you get one card.
"
4246,"That one card could be worth $1 00,
"
4247,"which brings your total to $1 500.
"
4248,"Don't get excited, that won't happen
"
4249,"unless you get the-- No way!
"
4250,"This is the last box of your clothes.
"
4251,"I'm just gonna label it
"
4252,"""What were you thinking?""
"
4253,"I was just gonna go across
"
4254,"the hall and write that on Chandler.
"
4255,"Guys, I don't wanna make
"
4256,"things worse, but. . .
"
4257,". . .I don't wanna live with
"
4258,"Rachel anymore.
"
4259,"You're so mean to each other.
"
4260,"I don't wanna end up like that
"
4261,"with Rachel. I still like you.
"
4262,"That's fine because I'm not moving.
"
4263,"Phoebe, you gotta take her.
"
4264,"I said some bad stuff. . .
"
4265,". . .but Rachel has qualities
"
4266,"that make her a good roommate.
"
4267,"Like what, Monica?
"
4268,"She has 1 47,000 pair of boots?
"
4269,"Good start, Mon.
"
4270,"She lets you borrow them.
"
4271,"And you stretch them out
"
4272,"with your big old clown feet.
"
4273,"Do you wanna live outside?
"
4274,"Because it's getting cold!
"
4275,"She gets tons of catalogs and folds
"
4276,"down the pages of things I'd like.
"
4277,"What else?
"
4278,"When I take a shower. . .
"
4279,". . .she leaves me notes on the mirror.
"
4280,"I do. I do do that.
"
4281,"That's nice. I like having things
"
4282,"to read in the bathroom.
"
4283,"When I fall asleep on the couch. . .
"
4284,". . .she covers me with a blanket.
"
4285,"Well, you know,
"
4286,"I don't want you to be cold.
"
4287,"And when I told her I was gonna
"
4288,"move in with Chandler. . .
"
4289,". . .she was really supportive.
"
4290,"You were so great.
"
4291,"You made it so easy.
"
4292,"And now you have to leave.
"
4293,"And I have to live with a boy!
"
4294,"It's gonna be fine.
"
4295,"Now I can't wait to live with you!
"
4296,"You know what we should do?
"
4297,"Bring Monica, and we'll live together!
"
4298,"We'll have so much fun!
"
4299,"I think she's moving in with Chandler.
"
4300,"Oh, that's right.
"
4301,"You're still set on that?
"
4302,"Kinda.
"
4303,"Oh, my God!
"
4304,"How's the packing going?
"
4305,"Ben? He's fine. He's right--
"
4306,"Oh, my God!
"
4307,"Get your head out of your shirt
"
4308,"there, son!
"
4309,"Yeah, it's a pumpkin. I'll come pack.
"
4310,"-What's wrong?
"
4311,"-Ross and I were helping pack. . .
"
4312,". . .took a little break.
"
4313,"I lost $1 500 to him in Cups!
"
4314,"How did you lose at Cups?
"
4315,"The same way you lost!
"
4316,"I started out with the king and the
"
4317,"queen. Bam! Ross gets a 2 and a 3.
"
4318,"Then I get a jack and a king.
"
4319,"Boom! Ross gets a 4 and 5.
"
4320,"Even Ross was getting the Cup card,
"
4321,"the D Cup. . .
"
4322,". . .the sitting-down bonus. I didn't
"
4323,"even get half a cup! Nothing!
"
4324,"Oh, man!
"
4325,"He never played before either.
"
4326,"I think beginner's luck
"
4327,"is very important in Cups!
"
4328,"Let's play one more hand.
"
4329,"One more hand.
"
4330,"No more! I cannot lose another dime.
"
4331,"I'm serious this time.
"
4332,"In fact, look.
"
4333,"I wanna give you something.
"
4334,"Let me give it to you before
"
4335,"I pawn it for Cups money.
"
4336,"I want you to have
"
4337,"the big, white dog. . .
"
4338,". . .as a thank-you for being
"
4339,"such a great roommate.
"
4340,"I can't take the big, white dog.
"
4341,"You love it.
"
4342,"It's ""him. "" Not ""it. ""
"
4343,"What if I bought it from you?
"
4344,"Then your nice gesture would be
"
4345,"giving it to me at a reasonable price.
"
4346,"Say $1 500?
"
4347,"Wait a second.
"
4348,"I see what you're trying to do here.
"
4349,"You're trying to give me money again!
"
4350,"When did I try to give you money?
"
4351,"Over there with the bills!
"
4352,"You tried to give me charity,
"
4353,"I said no, you dropped it.
"
4354,"We had a nice last night together.
"
4355,"We had some fun, we gambled, nobody
"
4356,"tried to give anybody any money.
"
4357,"Now you start with the
"
4358,"charity thing again!
"
4359,"I'm trying to help you out.
"
4360,"I wanna make sure that you're okay.
"
4361,"I will be okay.
"
4362,"You gotta get it out of your head
"
4363,"that I can't take care of myself.
"
4364,"I'm not gonna miss you helping me
"
4365,"out with money.
"
4366,"The only thing I'm gonna miss. . .
"
4367,". . .is you.
"
4368,"And now the dog.
"
4369,"-Call me when you get there, okay?
"
4370,"-Okay.
"
4371,"I'm really gonna miss you.
"
4372,"I have your key.
"
4373,"-Here you go.
"
4374,"-Thanks.
"
4375,"God, this is silly.
"
4376,"I'll see you in a couple of hours.
"
4377,"Bye, house.
"
4378,"-She really left.
"
4379,"-I know.
"
4380,"-Thank you.
"
4381,"-No problem, roomie.
"
4382,"-Can I ask you a question?
"
4383,"-Sure.
"
4384,"What the hell is that dog doing here?
"
4385,"I invented the game of Cups
"
4386,"as a way to give Joey money.
"
4387,"-And now you want that money back?
"
4388,"-Exactly.
"
4389,"What kind of idiot do you
"
4390,"take me for?
"
4391,"It's not a real game.
"
4392,"I made it up.
"
4393,"I'm sorry you lost your money.
"
4394,"But I won it fair and square.
"
4395,"At a fake game!
"
4396,"If you wanna try to
"
4397,"make some of it back. . .
"
4398,". . .I'd be glad to play you for it.
"
4399,"But I should warn you.
"
4400,"I am very good at Cups.
"
4401,"I assume the saucer card
"
4402,"came up when you played last?
"
4403,"Let's see if it comes up this time.
"
4404,"<font color=""#ffff00"" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net

"
4428,"Oh, you're no ordinary roommate,
"
4429,"are you?
"
4430,"Can we finish this later?
"
4431,"I'm going running before it gets dark.
"
4432,"-Why don't you come with me?
"
4433,"-Really?
"
4434,"It'll be fun! We'll run in the park.
"
4435,"It'll be our roommate-bonding thing.

"
4448,"I just finished this
"
4449,"fascinating book.
"
4450,"By the year 2030,
"
4451,"there'll be computers. . .
"
4452,". . .that can carry out the same amount
"
4453,"of functions as a human brain.
"
4454,"So, theoretically,
"
4455,"you could download. . .
"
4456,". . .your thoughts and memories
"
4457,"into this computer. . .
"
4458,". . .and live forever as a machine.
"
4459,"And I just realized I can sleep
"
4460,"with my eyes open.
"
4461,"Honey, it was a great idea,
"
4462,"nailing the boxes to the floor.
"
4463,"-I didn't nail the boxes to the floor.
"
4464,"-So you can move them!
"
4465,"And while I'm doing that, Ross has
"
4466,"a great computer story for you.
"
4467,"Hey, everybody!
"
4468,"I'd like you to meet Janine.
"
4469,"She's gonna be my new roommate!
"
4470,"And she's gonna live with me!
"
4471,"It's nice to meet you. Janine. . .?
"
4472,"Le Croix.
"
4473,"I didn't know that.
"
4474,"What a pretty last name.
"
4475,"So where are you from?
"
4476,"Australia.
"
4477,"I just moved here.
"
4478,"From the land down under?
"
4479,"I didn't know that either!
"
4480,"So what do you do?
"
4481,"-I'm a dancer.
"
4482,"-You're a dancer?
"
4483,"She's a dancer!
"
4484,"I think I'll go unpack.
"
4485,"Did you interview her
"
4486,"before you asked her to move in?
"
4487,"Of course!
"
4488,"What did you ask her?
"
4489,"When can you move in?
"
4490,"Thank you for bringing her
"
4491,"into our lives.
"
4492,"Unbelievable.
"
4493,"You like her too?
"
4494,"Look at all the boxes!
"
4495,"I cannot wait to ask her out.
"
4496,"Wait a minute.
"
4497,"You can't. She's your roommate.
"
4498,"It'll be too complicated.
"
4499,"Yeah, don't do it.
"
4500,"I mean, if you date her,
"
4501,"then I can't date her.
"
4502,"Think about it. Remember
"
4503,"when you broke up with Donna. . .
"
4504,". . .how horrible it was when you
"
4505,"bumped into her at the supermarket?
"
4506,"Oh, God, yeah.
"
4507,"Now imagine you live
"
4508,"at the supermarket.
"
4509,"Okay!
"
4510,"You're right! I don't want that.
"
4511,"I can't date her.
"
4512,"You'd better watch the flirting too,
"
4513,"because it could be trouble.
"
4514,"Well, that's gonna be tough, Mon.
"
4515,"It's hard for me to be around
"
4516,"an attractive woman and not flirt.
"
4517,"You're around me all the time,
"
4518,"and you don't flirt.
"
4519,"A little sad about that, sweetie?
"
4520,"I have to tie my shoes, so you
"
4521,"go ahead. I'll catch up.
"
4522,"Come on, that's not running!
"
4523,"Let's go!
"
4524,"I'm telling you, when she runs. . .
"
4525,". . .she looks like Kermit the Frog. . .
"
4526,". . .and the Six Million Dollar Man.
"
4527,"Monica had such a crush on him.
"
4528,"She used to kiss his poster
"
4529,"every night before she went to bed.
"
4530,"I used to do that too!
"
4531,"Did you also have his album,
"
4532,"""It's Not Easy Being Green""?
"
4533,"Oh, Mon.
"
4534,"So Phoebe runs weird, huh?
"
4535,"Yeah. And I know she'll
"
4536,"want to run again.
"
4537,"I don't know how to get out of it.
"
4538,"I mean, I live with her.
"
4539,"Why don't you be straight with her?
"
4540,"Tell her the truth.
"
4541,"You're right.
"
4542,"I should just tell her the truth.
"
4543,"Pheebs, Monica tripped me. I don't
"
4544,"think I can ever run again, ever!
"
4545,"Why? Why would you do that?
"
4546,"I don't know.
"
4547,"Rachel, I'm sorry I hurt your ankles.
"
4548,"Ankle.
"
4549,"We'll see.
"
4550,"Okay. I am officially unpacked.
"
4551,"Thanks for helping me, man.
"
4552,"Joe?
"
4553,"Well, I guess Joey went home.
"
4554,"And look, there is still one box
"
4555,"I have to unpack.
"
4556,"I got you!
"
4557,"Oh, my God. . .
"
4558,". . .you almost gave me
"
4559,"a heart attack.
"
4560,"It was so hard not to laugh.
"
4561,"Hey, the place looks great.
"
4562,"Not bad, right?
"
4563,"Monica's working late,
"
4564,"so I'm gonna make this place spotless.
"
4565,"You know what else I'll do?
"
4566,"I'm gonna go downstairs
"
4567,"and get her some flowers.
"
4568,"Who wouldn't want to live with me?
"
4569,"I don't.
"
4570,"No, I want to live with
"
4571,"the super-hot Australian dancer!
"
4572,"How's that going? Are you okay
"
4573,"with the not-flirting thing?
"
4574,"So far. But it's tough.
"
4575,"I've got this built-up flirting energy,
"
4576,"and I don't know how to get rid of it.
"
4577,"How you doing?
"
4578,"Oh, man!
"
4579,"Sorry. There's just
"
4580,"more room out here.
"
4581,"No, you just reminded me
"
4582,"that I have to do my stretches too.
"
4583,"Why don't you try to be. . .?
"
4584,"-What's wrong?
"
4585,"-Nothing.
"
4586,"I didn't want you to touch me. . .
"
4587,". . .because I'm all sweaty
"
4588,"from the workout.
"
4589,"I'm gonna hit the shower.
"
4590,"Oh, my God!
"
4591,"Sorry about that stuff
"
4592,"hanging in there.
"
4593,"It's just my thongs are
"
4594,"too delicate for the dryer.
"
4595,"Oh, yeah, it's me.
"
4596,"I saw you grab your running shoes
"
4597,"this morning and sneak out.
"
4598,"You lied so you could run by yourself.
"
4599,"No, Phoebe, no. I was. . . .
"
4600,"I was actually just checking. . .
"
4601,". . .to see. . .
"
4602,". . .if I could run. And I can!
"
4603,"Please, I'm not an idiot.
"
4604,"No, wait. Phoebe?
"
4605,"Wow. Couples who live together
"
4606,"do start to look alike.
"
4607,"So, Mondler. . . .
"
4608,"What are you doing?
"
4609,"What does it look like?
"
4610,"I am cleaning.
"
4611,"Did you get Monica's authorization
"
4612,"to move all her stuff?
"
4613,"I don't need that.
"
4614,"I'll put everything back.
"
4615,"Put it back exactly
"
4616,"where you found it?
"
4617,"Yes. I'm gonna put it back
"
4618,"exactly where I found it.
"
4619,"First of all,
"
4620,"that attitude is not helping.
"
4621,"She won't care if I put her stuff
"
4622,"back in the same stupid place.
"
4623,"Hello? Did you just meet Monica?
"
4624,"She'll recognize
"
4625,"that I did a nice thing. . .
"
4626,". . .and appreciate it.
"
4627,"Actually, this will work out well.
"
4628,"Because when you move back
"
4629,"with Joey. . .
"
4630,". . .Joey's hot new roommate
"
4631,"can come live with me.
"
4632,"Oh, I see. You're trying
"
4633,"to freak me out.
"
4634,"Chandler, Monica is really weird
"
4635,"about this kind of stuff, all right?
"
4636,"Believe me, I lived with her for
"
4637,"1 6 years. She's going to freak out.
"
4638,"Oh, my God.
"
4639,"She's going to sit on you.
"
4640,"No, she is not.
"
4641,"I'll prove it to you.
"
4642,"I'll call her right now.
"
4643,"Phone's done.
"
4644,"-Hey, Mon. How's it going?
"
4645,"-Terrible.
"
4646,"If I want something done right,
"
4647,"I have to do it myself.
"
4648,"Other people just wreck stuff.
"
4649,"I think I might kill someone tonight.
"
4650,"Come on, it can't be that bad.
"
4651,"The only thing getting me through. . .
"
4652,". . .is knowing I'll see you soon.
"
4653,"I might even try
"
4654,"to get out of here early.
"
4655,"It sounds like they need you there.
"
4656,"-You're just hanging out with Ross?
"
4657,"-It's all good! Okay, bye!
"
4658,"She's gonna kill me.
"
4659,"The phone was facing the other way.
"
4660,"And that goes back up there.
"
4661,"We should start with the big stuff.
"
4662,"That'll be the easiest.
"
4663,"Let's start with the couch.
"
4664,"I got it.
"
4665,"That doesn't look right.
"
4666,"What are you talking about?
"
4667,"The couch is in line with the carpet.
"
4668,"Then I can just walk over here
"
4669,"and casually put my feet up on. . . .
"
4670,"Okay, here's what we do.
"
4671,"We move the couch
"
4672,"closer to the coffee table.
"
4673,"But then the back of the couch
"
4674,"won't line up with the carpet.
"
4675,"Well, we'll just move
"
4676,"the coffee table. . .
"
4677,". . .closer to the couch.
"
4678,"But then the coffee table
"
4679,"won't be centered in the seating area.
"
4680,"But the coffee table doesn't
"
4681,"match the table!
"
4682,"Look, what am I gonna do?
"
4683,"I'm not flirting, but I'm drawing
"
4684,"her to me like a moth to a flame!
"
4685,"What the hell's going on over here?
"
4686,"Monica's gonna kill you!
"
4687,"I need your help.
"
4688,"I have to do something
"
4689,"to repel this woman.
"
4690,"Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
"
4691,"You guys repel women all the time!
"
4692,"Hey, I've been married three times.
"
4693,"No, I've seen it happen.
"
4694,"You get a rapport going with a woman,
"
4695,"but somehow you manage to kill it.
"
4696,"What's your secret?
"
4697,"We do not repel women, okay?
"
4698,"That is completely untrue.
"
4699,"Oh, yes, we do, my man.
"
4700,"Remember when we went to a dance. . .
"
4701,". . .and you walked up to that girl
"
4702,"you liked and talked. . .
"
4703,". . .about the lrish potato famine?
"
4704,"What about you?
"
4705,"You weren't so hot either.
"
4706,"After everything he said,
"
4707,"he'd go--
"
4708,"Monica doesn't like that either.
"
4709,"I should stop doing that.
"
4710,"Girls don't like it when
"
4711,"I start talking about science.
"
4712,"That's not specific to girls.
"
4713,"This is great. What else?
"
4714,"They don't like you correcting
"
4715,"their grammar.
"
4716,"And they don't like it when you
"
4717,"explain why your jokes are funny.
"
4718,"They don't like it when you
"
4719,"keep asking them if they like you.
"
4720,"-Man, I am so lucky I have Monica.
"
4721,"-I'm never gonna find love again.
"
4722,"-Can I talk to you for a second?
"
4723,"-Sure.
"
4724,"Phoebe, I just wanted to say
"
4725,"I'm sorry, okay?
"
4726,"I handled the situation horribly.
"
4727,"And I should not have lied to you.
"
4728,"So what should you have done?
"
4729,"I should have told you the truth.
"
4730,"Which is?
"
4731,"Well, the reason I didn't
"
4732,"want to go running with you is. . .
"
4733,". . .because. . .
"
4734,". . .the way that you run
"
4735,"is just a little. . . .
"
4736,"-So?
"
4737,"-It's embarrassing.
"
4738,"People were looking at us
"
4739,"like we were crazy.
"
4740,"-Why do you care?
"
4741,"-Because they're people!
"
4742,"People you don't know
"
4743,"and will never see again.
"
4744,"Yes, but still they are people. . .
"
4745,". . .with eyes.
"
4746,"I didn't get embarrassed
"
4747,"running next to Miss. . . .
"
4748,"But okay.
"
4749,"I can see why running with me
"
4750,"would be embarrassing to you.
"
4751,"Okay. You're uptight.
"
4752,"What? I am not uptight.
"
4753,"I am not uptight, man.
"
4754,"That's okay. I'm not judging you.
"
4755,"That's just who you are.
"
4756,"I'm more free, you know.
"
4757,"I run like I did when I was a kid. . .
"
4758,". . .because that's the only way
"
4759,"it's fun, you know?
"
4760,"Didn't you ever run so fast
"
4761,"you thought your legs would fall off. . .
"
4762,". . .Iike when you were running towards
"
4763,"the swings or running away from Satan?
"
4764,"The neighbor's dog.
"
4765,"Is this in the right place?
"
4766,"Who cares? I repel women.
"
4767,"You can't come in here!
"
4768,"Ross is naked!
"
4769,"I couldn't say I was naked,
"
4770,"because she's allowed to see me naked.
"
4771,"Why does anyone have to be naked?
"
4772,"Why is Ross naked?
"
4773,"I had to show Chandler something.
"
4774,"Naked?
"
4775,"I guess I have. . .
"
4776,". . .a ""guy"" problem.
"
4777,"Is it the same thing
"
4778,"Chandler had?
"
4779,"We'll get everything squared away,
"
4780,"and you can come back later!
"
4781,"There's still some of Chandler's
"
4782,"medicine in the bathroom.
"
4783,"-Bye.
"
4784,"-Bye!
"
4785,"Thank God.
"
4786,"Dude, what'd you have?
"
4787,"We have no time, okay?
"
4788,"We must focus.
"
4789,"We've got to get everything
"
4790,"back into its original place.
"
4791,"The photo album!
"
4792,"There were millions of pictures
"
4793,"of the apartment in the photo album.
"
4794,"We just match everything
"
4795,"to the pictures!
"
4796,"That's perfect! That's brilliant!
"
4797,"What'd you have?
"
4798,"I've got some beer for you.
"
4799,"Don't you mean ""for whom""?
"
4800,"Sure.
"
4801,"I was gonna order some pizza.
"
4802,"You wanna share one?
"
4803,"Pizza? It's not like I never
"
4804,"had that before.
"
4805,"Is something wrong?
"
4806,"All right, all right.
"
4807,"Let's just get this
"
4808,"out in the open, okay?
"
4809,"You're hot.
"
4810,"I'm lovable.
"
4811,"Clearly, there's a vibe
"
4812,"going on between us.
"
4813,"But we're roommates. . .
"
4814,". . .and it's a huge mistake
"
4815,"for us to continue down this road.
"
4816,"Imagine living in a supermarket. . .
"
4817,". . .and you'll understand.
"
4818,"Okay? So the question is,
"
4819,"what do we do?
"
4820,"There isn't anything to do.
"
4821,"I think you're really sweet.
"
4822,"But I'm not interested
"
4823,"in you like that.
"
4824,"No, I mean. . . .
"
4825,"You're a nice guy, and I'm happy
"
4826,"to be your roommate and your friend.
"
4827,"I'm just, you know, I just. . .
"
4828,". . .don't feel that way about you.
"
4829,"I see what happened.
"
4830,"It's because I was trying
"
4831,"to repel you.
"
4832,"Right? Believe me, you'd feel
"
4833,"a lot different if I turned it on.
"
4834,"-I don't think so.
"
4835,"-Oh, I do.
"
4836,"How you doing?
"
4837,"I'm okay.
"
4838,"What?
"
4839,"What?
"
4840,"Oh, dear God!
"
4841,"I'm so sorry. You're right.
"
4842,"This feels great!
"
4843,"And you don't care if people stare.
"
4844,"It's only a second. Then you're gone!
"
4845,"It's amazing!
"
4846,"I feel so free and so graceful!
"
4847,"Watch out for the horse.
"
4848,"Can I come in now?
"
4849,"-Why is everything different?
"
4850,"-Bye.
"
4851,"I don't see anything different. . .
"
4852,". . .other than the fact that the room
"
4853,"got brighter when you came into it.
"
4854,"The end table is wrong,
"
4855,"the couch looks bizarre. . .
"
4856,". . .and don't even get me started
"
4857,"on the refrigerator magnets.
"
4858,"Okay, don't be mad, okay?
"
4859,"After I unpacked the boxes, I wanted
"
4860,"to do something nice for you. . .
"
4861,". . .so I cleaned the apartment.
"
4862,"So I moved everything around,
"
4863,"and then I forgot. . .
"
4864,". . .where it went back.
"
4865,"I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry.
"
4866,"That's okay.
"
4867,"Are you afraid of me or something?
"
4868,"Do you want me to be afraid of you?
"
4869,"Of course not.
"
4870,"My gosh, Chandler, what you did
"
4871,"is a wonderful thing. . .
"
4872,". . .and I really appreciate it.
"
4873,"I have this thing where I want
"
4874,"everything in the perfect place.
"
4875,"But I'd never expect you
"
4876,"to worry about that.
"
4877,"Really?
"
4878,"Of course.
"
4879,"Oh, you're the best.
"
4880,"You come here to me.
"
4881,"Hold on, okay?
"
4882,"First things first.
"
4883,"Did Ross sit anywhere
"
4884,"while he was naked?
"
4885,"It said that by the year 2030. . .
"
4886,". . .there'll be computers carrying
"
4887,"out the same number of functions. . .
"
4888,". . .as an actual human brain.
"
4889,"So, theoretically, you could
"
4890,"download your thoughts. . .
"
4891,". . .and your memories
"
4892,"into this computer--
"
4893,"And live forever as a machine.
"
4894,"Janine, do you know
"
4895,"what we're doing right now?
"

"
4911,"Oh, my God!
"
4912,"It's like a guy never lived in here.
"
4913,"You gotta be careful. This girl
"

"
4915,"It is?
"
4916,"Is this your pretty pink pillow

4918,"Is that your tiny little box that's

"
4920,"Okay, this is not good.

"
4936,"-How was breakfast with Hillary?
"
4937,"-Okay.
"
4938,"She's still depressed because
"
4939,"she broke up with her boyfriend.
"
4940,"Is this Hillary, your
"
4941,"hot assistant chef, Hillary?
"
4942,"The one that stares at me
"
4943,"when I come in?
"
4944,"The one who looked at you once
"
4945,"because you got in her way.
"
4946,"Still, I could tell. She was into me.
"
4947,"Why don't you set us up?
"
4948,"Are you setting Ross up with someone?
"
4949,"Does she have a wedding dress?
"
4950,"Rachel?
"
4951,"I'm making up flyers to try
"
4952,"to get new massage clients.
"
4953,"Can I come to Bloomingdale's
"
4954,"and use the copier?
"
4955,"Sure, but they might think it's weird
"
4956,"since I don't work there anymore.
"
4957,"Oh, my God! What happened?
"
4958,"I got a job at Ralph Lauren.
"
4959,"Well, that's great! Congratulations!
"
4960,"A year ago.
"
4961,"You've lasted all year! Good for you.
"
4962,"You could still use the copier
"
4963,"where I actually work.
"
4964,"But come by at lunch
"
4965,"so my boss doesn't see you.
"
4966,"Kim will freak out.
"
4967,"She doesn't like me.
"
4968,"-I don't think my boss likes me.
"
4969,"-I don't think mine likes me.
"
4970,"Maybe it's a universal thing.
"
4971,"Maybe because you're all hanging
"
4972,"around here at 1 1 :30 on a Wednesday.
"
4973,"Let's head off to work.
"
4974,"-Thank you.
"
4975,"-Sure.

"
4982,"-What?
"
4983,"What?
"
4984,"-You kissed him?

4985,"-Totally.
"
4986,"Phoebe, are you serious?
"
4987,"He came in and introduced himself.
"
4988,"The next thing I know,
"
4989,"we're making out!
"
4990,"Phoebe, you do know he's married?
"
4991,"Phoebe.
"
4992,"I'm supposed to ask every guy
"
4993,"I make out with if he's married?
"
4994,"No, yeah, I should.
"
4995,"Hey, Joey.
"
4996,"Can I talk to you for a second?
"
4997,"There's a kid in this picture.
"
4998,"Do you know this kid?
"
4999,"ls it a relative?
"
5000,"No. I just thought it was cute.
"
5001,"That's what I was afraid of. Okay. . . .
"

"
5004,". . .some of this new stuff,

"
5007,"Like this.
"
5008,"Pictures of cute babies we don't know.

"
5014,"I don't want to be a jerk, but
"

"
5016,"I'm sorry. I wanted to make

"
5018,"But it's too much stuff.
"
5019,"You know, you got the candles and
"
5020,"the ""foofy schmoofer"" thing here.
"
5021,"Over here, you got
"
5022,"a picture of a watering can.
"
5023,"I just thought--
"
5024,"I'm sure it's a famous watering can.
"
5025,"But come on.
"
5026,"And what is with the really hot stick
"
5027,"in the bathroom?
"
5028,"It's a curling iron.
"
5029,"Well, that's okay then.
"
5030,"Okay, my towels, for instance.
"
5031,"I come into the bathroom. . .
"
5032,". . .and my towel is not on the floor,
"
5033,"where I keep it.
"
5034,"It's up here on some hook.
"
5035,"And it smells different.
"
5036,"It's clean.
"
5037,"It feels different.
"
5038,"It's dry.
"
5039,"All right, I can make my peace
"
5040,"with the clean, dry towels.
"
5041,"Also what is with
"
5042,"these chips you bought?
"
5043,"It's potpourri.
"
5044,"You're supposed to smell it.
"
5045,"Well, that's like summer in a bowl.
"
5046,"Kim, hi.
"
5047,"I handed in that marketing report, and
"
5048,"I never got to hear what you thought.
"
5049,"I didn't read it.
"
5050,"The spring line's really gonna be
"
5051,"great this year, huh?
"
5052,"I hear Ralph Lauren fooled around
"
5053,"with someone in the copy room.
"
5054,"Tell me everything.
"
5055,"Hey, guys.
"
5056,"What's up?
"
5057,"You know. . . .
"
5058,"Oh, my God.
"
5059,"What happened to your teeth?
"
5060,"I whitened them.
"
5061,"Really?
"
5062,"What do you think?
"
5063,"I think I shouldn't look
"
5064,"directly at them.
"
5065,"Come on, seriously.
"
5066,"-They're really, really, really white.
"
5067,"-What was wrong with your old. . .
"
5068,". . .human teeth?
"
5069,"I did leave the gel on
"
5070,"a little longer than it said to.
"
5071,"-How much longer?
"
5072,"-A day.
"
5073,"Tonight is your date with Hillary.
"
5074,"I know. That's why I did it.
"
5075,"Are they really that bad?
"
5076,"You'll be fine.
"
5077,"Hillary's blind, right?
"
5078,"She will be after tonight.
"
5079,"Oh, Rach.
"
5080,"Do you notice anything--?
"
5081,"Your teeth?
"
5082,"Yes, I saw them from outside.
"
5083,"You guys are never gonna
"
5084,"believe this. . .
"
5085,". . .but Phoebe made out
"
5086,"with Ralph Lauren.
"
5087,"-What?
"
5088,"-Oh, my God!
"
5089,"She ran into him at my office,
"
5090,"and they just made out.

5091,"The craziest thing is,

5095,"I am proud of all my friends today.
"
5096,"I can't believe Phoebe made out
"
5097,"with Ralph Lauren.
"
5098,"I'm so jealous!
"
5099,"Hi, I'm Chandler,
"
5100,"your live-in boyfriend.
"
5101,"Chandler, please. Come on.
"
5102,"Look at him.
"
5103,"Well, I am no woman,
"
5104,"but that is one tasty dish.
"
5105,"Here.
"
5106,"Who's the silver fox?
"
5107,"That is your make-out buddy.
"
5108,"Don't you recognize him?
"
5109,"Oh, wait.
"
5110,"""Phoebe, I love you.
"
5111,"Kiss me, please. ""
"
5112,"That's not Ralph Lauren.
"
5113,"It sounds like him, though.
"
5114,"What?
"
5115,"Ralph doesn't look like that guy.
"
5116,"He's young, and he's got long hair
"
5117,"and a beard and a Hacky Sack--
"
5118,"Oh, my God. That's not Ralph Lauren.
"
5119,"That's Kenny the copy guy!
"
5120,"What?
"
5121,"I told my boss that someone
"
5122,"made out with Ralph Lauren.
"
5123,"If she finds out that I lied to her,
"
5124,"she'll hate me even more. Phoebe!
"
5125,"Why would the copy guy say
"
5126,"he's Ralph Lauren?
"
5127,"To get you to make out with him!
"
5128,"This will make them look less white.
"
5129,"Nope.
"
5130,"Colors that don't work are. . .
"
5131,". . .blue, yellow, green, red, black,
"
5132,"white, orange and purple.
"
5133,"I don't know what I'm gonna do.
"
5134,"The date starts in an hour.
"
5135,"Maybe if your skin was lighter,
"
5136,"your teeth wouldn't look so bright.
"
5137,"Oh, great! So all I need to do
"
5138,"is get some new skin. Thank you.
"
5139,"If we put just a little bit
"
5140,"of makeup on you--
"
5141,"Whoa!
"
5142,"We're not 1 3 anymore.
"
5143,"This is the only thing left
"
5144,"that has a shot at working.
"
5145,"Won't she notice I have makeup on?
"
5146,"Half the guys out there
"
5147,"have makeup on.
"
5148,"What?
"
5149,"Half the people-- I mean--
"
5150,"Just try it and see.
"
5151,"I am not putting on makeup.
"
5152,"Hello? Ross, could you put up
"
5153,"some of these flyers for me?
"
5154,"No! Demon! Demon!
"
5155,"Our drawers will smell nice, and
"
5156,"we didn't waste these pantyhose.
"
5157,"God forbid we throw out old underwear.
"
5158,"You know what?
"
5159,"I'm gonna go over to Joey's.
"
5160,"We've got to organize
"
5161,"the wrapping paper.
"
5162,"I've really gotten in touch with
"
5163,"my feminine side enough today.
"
5164,"In fact, we're two sachets away
"
5165,"from becoming a lesbian couple.
"
5166,"This has been a girlie day.
"
5167,"You're right. I'm sorry.
"
5168,"I just feel like I need
"
5169,"to be in a ""guy"" place. . .
"
5170,". . .do kind of a ""man"" thing.
"
5171,"You go over to Joey's and. . .
"
5172,". . .drink some beer and
"
5173,"hammer up some dry wall.
"
5174,"When guys hang out, they don't just
"
5175,"drink beer and hammer up dry wall.
"
5176,"When girls hang out, we don't have
"
5177,"pillow fights in our underwear.
"
5178,"I'm sorry. We do.
"
5179,"I don't know why I said that.
"
5180,"Hey, Chandler.
"
5181,"Come on in.
"
5182,"We're knitting potholders.
"
5183,"No, thanks, Josephine.
"
5184,"Ross, I was wondering if--
"
5185,"Oh, my God! Where are all the men?
"
5186,"-Hi, Kim.
"
5187,"-Hi, Rachel.
"
5188,"Remember what happened yesterday?
"
5189,"Well, it didn't happen.
"
5190,"You didn't cancel the fabric order?
"
5191,"Okay, two things didn't happen.
"
5192,"Remember I told you someone
"
5193,"made out with Ralph Lauren?
"
5194,"Well, it turns out that's not true.
"
5195,"It's not true?
"
5196,"That's interesting.
"
5197,"Because I checked. Only one keycard
"
5198,"was used to access the copier. . .
"
5199,". . .yesterday during lunch, and
"
5200,"that keycard belonged to you.
"
5201,"You think I made out with him?
"
5202,"Listen to me. . .
"
5203,". . .sleeping with Ralph is not
"
5204,"gonna get you my job.
"
5205,"I don't want your job. I don't.
"
5206,"This is a mistake.
"
5207,"I didn't make out with him.
"
5208,"Nobody made out with him.
"
5209,"I didn't use my keycard yesterday.
"
5210,"I don't even know
"
5211,"how to use my keycard.
"
5212,"-Hi, Ralph.
"
5213,"-Hi, Kim.
"
5214,"Yeah. Nothing happened.
"
5215,"You could cut the sexual tension
"
5216,"in here with a knife.
"
5217,"After that, what could I do
"
5218,"except become a chef?
"
5219,"Soon, I hope to open
"
5220,"my own restaurant.
"
5221,"You're a really great listener.
"
5222,"Most guys I go out with,
"
5223,"they talk and talk.
"
5224,"It's like, ""Shut your mouth. ""
"
5225,"You know?
"
5226,"I've been talking too much.
"
5227,"Why don't we talk about you?
"
5228,"Come on, I want to know.
"
5229,"Okay. I'm from Long lsland.
"
5230,"I came to the city for college.
"
5231,"I have a 5-year-old son,
"
5232,"and in my spare time. . .
"
5233,". . .I like to read spy novels.
"
5234,"But let's talk more about you.
"
5235,"If you sear the stems of the flowers
"
5236,"first in a frying pan. . .
"
5237,". . .your arrangement will
"
5238,"look fresh much longer.
"
5239,"Joey, that is such a great tip!
"
5240,"Monica, I need to talk
"
5241,"to the girl with the flowers.
"
5242,"Okay, but I'm gonna teach you
"
5243,"how to make a bird feeder. . .
"
5244,". . .out of a pine cone
"
5245,"and some peanut butter.
"
5246,"I love birds.
"
5247,"What is the matter with you?
"
5248,"-What?
"
5249,"-You're arranging flowers!
"
5250,"You got dead flowers!
"
5251,"You've got a picture of a baby
"
5252,"dressed like flowers!
"
5253,"This is not Joey!
"
5254,"Look, I am still Joey, okay?
"
5255,"Flowers, they're just nice to look at.
"
5256,"And that happens to be a picture
"
5257,"by a famous artist of a famous baby.
"
5258,"You're turning into a woman.
"
5259,"No, I'm not.
"
5260,"Why would you say that?
"
5261,"That's just mean.
"
5262,"Now I've upset you? What did I say?
"
5263,"It's not what you said.
"
5264,"It's the way you said it.
"
5265,"Oh, my God!
"
5266,"I'm a woman!
"
5267,"So now she thinks that I made out
"
5268,"with him to get her job.
"
5269,"-Why didn't you just tell the truth?
"
5270,"-I did.
"
5271,"She doesn't think anyone would confuse
"
5272,"Kenny the copy guy with Ralph Lauren.
"
5273,"What if Kenny were the real brains
"
5274,"behind the whole company?
"
5275,"What if Kenny hired that Ralph guy
"
5276,"to be the pretty front man, huh?
"
5277,"Did she ever think of that?
"
5278,"You were with Kenny today.
"
5279,"Just for a second.
"
5280,"Phoebe, what am I gonna do?
"
5281,"The only thing you can do.
"
5282,"Sleep with him.
"
5283,"I'm not gonna sleep with him.
"
5284,"I mean, I could, but I wouldn't.
"
5285,"Sleep with Kenny.
"
5286,"-That wouldn't help me.
"
5287,"-Oh, yes, it would.
"
5288,"I've had a really good time tonight.
"
5289,"I rarely connect with someone
"
5290,"this much on the first date.
"
5291,"Me neither.
"
5292,"I've had a really
"
5293,"good time too, you know.
"
5294,"Are you gonna eat that bread?
"
5295,"I just like the smell.
"
5296,"You make me laugh.
"
5297,"Would you like to move to the couch?
"
5298,"Maybe I'll just turn down
"
5299,"the lights a little?
"
5300,"How about all the way?
"
5301,"Okay.
"
5302,"Wow, cool poster.
"
5303,"Or should I say, ""groovy poster""?
"
5304,"So. . .
"
5305,". . .where were we?
"
5306,"Are those your teeth?
"
5307,"You can see them, huh?
"
5308,"Yes. They're insanely white.
"
5309,"I did that for you.
"
5310,"What's the matter with you?
"
5311,"What's the matter with me?
"
5312,"You've got a black light. It's 1 999!
"
5313,"Oh, good. Kim, hi.
"
5314,"Hi, Rachel. I wanted to ask you, have
"
5315,"you seen the new Ralph Lauren sheets?
"
5316,"What am I thinking?
"
5317,"Of course you have.
"
5318,"Okay, look.
"
5319,"I'm sorry that I lied to you before.
"
5320,"You were right. Ralph and I were
"
5321,"an item, but we're not anymore.
"
5322,"Oh, really?
"
5323,"Yeah, he dumped me.
"
5324,"He said, ""Rachel, I can't do this.
"
5325,"Even though you're a very, very. . .
"
5326,". . .very beautiful woman. . .
"
5327,". . .I can't do this.
"
5328,"I'm married and I'm sorry. ""
"
5329,"But he said,
"
5330,"""And you will never get promoted. . .
"
5331,". . .especially not above Kim,
"
5332,"who is an integral cog. . .
"
5333,". . .in the Ralph Lauren machine. ""
"
5334,"You expect me to believe--
"
5335,"-Hi, Ralph.
"
5336,"-Hi, Kim.
"
5337,"Oh, my God.
"
5338,"He gave you the coldest look I've
"
5339,"ever seen. It's like he hates you!
"
5340,"Then it is true!
"
5341,"Of course it's true.
"
5342,"And it hurts so bad.
"
5343,"Oh, honey, come here.
"
5344,"Oh, it'll be okay.
"
5345,"We've all been there.
"
5346,"You and Ralph?
"
5347,"Kenny the copy boy.
"
5348,"-I need to talk to you.
"
5349,"-What's the matter? You upset?
"
5350,"We gotta get rid of all
"
5351,"this girlie stuff in here.
"
5352,"I gotta be a man!
"
5353,"The living room has to
"
5354,"remain a guy place, okay?
"
5355,"That's the way it has to be.
"
5356,"I'll just put it all in my room.
"
5357,"Good. Great.
"
5358,"Thanks for being so understanding.
"
5359,"I didn't want to make
"
5360,"a big deal out of this.
"
5361,"But you could put the picture
"
5362,"of the famous baby in my room.
"
5363,"I mean, if you want to.
"
5364,"Okay.
"
5365,"And maybe the watering can there.
"
5366,"Sure.
"
5367,"And a couple of these
"
5368,"little tiny boxes.
"
5369,"Joey, do you want me to put
"
5370,"it all in your room?
"
5371,"Okay.

"
5374,"Guess who's coming
"
5375,"to Thanksgiving dinner?
"
5376,"Sidney Poitier?
"
5377,"I miss Rachel.
"
5378,"My parents.
"
5379,"Great, they haven't seen the place
"
5380,"since I moved in.
"
5381,"If you could not mention that
"
5382,"we live together, that'd be great.
"
5383,"I was thinking we'd eat around 4.
"
5384,"Why can't I tell them
"
5385,"we live together?
"
5386,"They don't know we're dating.
"
5387,"Should we eat in the kitchen?
"
5388,"Why haven't you told them?
"
5389,"Well, I was going to. I really was.
"
5390,"But then somewhere,
"
5391,"just out of nowhere, I didn't.
"
5392,"Why not? Wouldn't they be happy?
"
5393,"So, dinner in the kitchen around 4.
"
5394,"I'll see you then.
"
5395,"Why wouldn't they be happy?
"
5396,"Well, because. . .
"
5397,". . .mainly. . .
"
5398,". . .they don't like you.
"
5399,"-I'm sorry.
"
5400,"-What? Why? Why?
"
5401,"Maybe because you used to be aloof. . .
"
5402,". . .or that you're sarcastic
"
5403,"or that you joke around. . .
"
5404,". . .or that you throw your clothes
"
5405,"on the couch.
"
5406,"Is this why they don't like me
"
5407,"or you don't like me?
"
5408,"I know I should have told them.
"
5409,"I shouldn't care what they think.
"
5410,"I'm sorry.
"
5411,"It'll be okay because when
"
5412,"they come over, I will be charming.
"
5413,"I will make them love me,
"
5414,"then we'll tell them.
"
5415,"Will that work?
"
5416,"I can be pretty charming, babe.
"
5417,"I won you over, didn't l?
"
5418,"I don't think you'll ever get
"

"

"
5425,"Yes, of course they like you.
"
5426,"Monica told me they don't.
"
5427,"Yeah, they don't like you.
"
5428,"Do you know why?
"
5429,"Maybe it's because you're sarcastic
"
5430,"or maybe it's because you--
"
5431,"If people don't know,
"
5432,"they shouldn't just guess!
"
5433,"Another Thanksgiving
"
5434,"with nothing to give thanks for.
"
5435,"Maybe I give thanks
"
5436,"for you shutting up, huh?
"
5437,"Maybe I give thanks by taking

"

"
5441,"No, I don't want

"

"
5445,"Yeah, why?
"
5446,"Me and my friends are
"
5447,"doing Thanksgiving uptown.
"
5448,"I thought you might like to come.
"
5449,"For real?
"
5450,"You should go to Chandler's.
"
5451,"None of us can cook.
"
5452,"We'll just drink all day.
"
5453,"We go to yours!
"
5454,"We have to stop across the hall
"
5455,"because it's my sister.
"
5456,"But, you know, actually,
"
5457,"growing up with a sister was nice. . .
"
5458,". . .because it helped me
"
5459,"understand women.
"
5460,"Yeah, you should tell
"
5461,"your friends that.
"
5462,"Okay.
"
5463,"How you got three women to marry you,
"
5464,"I'll never know.
"
5465,"Pheebs, check it out!
"
5466,"For my dessert. . .
"
5467,". . .I'm making a traditional
"
5468,"English trifle.
"
5469,"Wow. That sounds great!
"
5470,"And what are you making, Monica?
"
5471,"In case Rachel's dessert is
"
5472,"so good that I eat all of it. . .
"
5473,". . .and there's none left
"
5474,"for anybody else!
"
5475,"Nothing.
"
5476,"Nothing?
"
5477,"No, sweetie. I trust you.
"
5478,"If I mess this up,
"

"
5480,"You won't mess it up.
"
5481,"I love that. You really
"
5482,"have faith in me. Thank you.
"
5483,"Question: How do you know
"
5484,"when the butter is done?
"
5485,"It's done about two minutes
"
5486,"before it looks like that.
"
5487,"-The food smells great, Mon.
"
5488,"-And the place looks so nice.
"
5489,"-Hey, happy Thanksgiving, everybody!
"
5490,"-Happy Thanksgiving!
"

"
5492,"-See you.
"
5493,"Whoa, whoa, whoa!
"
5494,"Where you going?
"
5495,"We did say we'd stop by this little
"
5496,"thing Joey's roommate is having.
"
5497,"Oh, Janine,
"
5498,"the really hot dancer girl?
"
5499,"Some would say she's attractive, yes.
"
5500,"Who else is going to be there?
"
5501,"Her friends.
"
5502,"Her dancer friends?
"
5503,"Yes! All right?
"
5504,"All of her hot dancer friends
"
5505,"are gonna be there. . .
"
5506,". . .and they'll be drinking and dancing
"
5507,"and we really want to go!
"
5508,"Dude, we were good.
"
5509,"You're not going. You said
"
5510,"you'd eat here and you'll eat here.
"
5511,"Yeah, and leaving us
"
5512,"to go see hot dancer girls. . .
"
5513,". . .is not very Thanksgiving-y.
"
5514,"Oh, but it is.
"
5515,"It's like the first Thanksgiving when
"
5516,"the lndians and Pilgrims sat down.
"
5517,"Then the lndians taught
"
5518,"the Pilgrims. . .
"
5519,". . .what it meant to be hot
"
5520,"in the New World!
"
5521,"-Hello, everybody!

"

5525,"It's Chandler!
"
5526,"Oh, yes, of course.
"
5527,"Hello, Chandler.
"
5528,"Mr. and Mrs. Geller,
"
5529,"you look wonderful.
"
5530,"It is great to have you here.
"
5531,"Let us take your coats.
"
5532,"Whoa, it snowing out there?
"
5533,"No.
"
5534,"Monica, all this food looks wonderful.
"
5535,"You should do this for a living.
"
5536,"Okay, I have dandruff.
"
5537,"There's no need to laugh and point.
"
5538,"Chandler was laughing at your joke.
"
5539,"My joke wasn't funny.
"
5540,"Rach, I just remembered.
"
5541,"I had a dream
"
5542,"about Mr. Geller last night.
"
5543,"Really?
"
5544,"I dreamt that he saved me
"
5545,"from a burning building. . .
"
5546,". . .and he was so brave and so strong.
"
5547,"And it's making me look at him
"
5548,"totally differently.
"
5549,"He used to be just
"
5550,"""Jack Geller, Monica and Ross' dad. ""
"
5551,"Now he's ""Jack Geller, dream hunk. ""
"
5552,"I don't know. To me,
"
5553,"he'll always be ""Jack Geller. . .
"
5554,". . .walks in while you're changing. ""
"
5555,"You know, Dad, Chandler is one
"
5556,"of Ross' very best friends.
"
5557,"Ross sure is a great guy.
"
5558,"I've always felt that
"
5559,"how a man turns out. . .
"
5560,". . .is a reflection on his father.
"
5561,"I always thought that too.
"
5562,"Tell me, what does your father do?
"
5563,"He's a headliner of a. . .
"
5564,". . .gay burlesque show.
"
5565,"You're killing us.
"
5566,"Will you serve the dessert already?
"
5567,"There's drunken dancers a-waiting!
"
5568,"Look at it. Isn't it beautiful?
"
5569,"Yeah. What is it?
"
5570,"It's a trifle.
"
5571,"It's got all these layers.
"
5572,"First there's a layer
"
5573,"of ladyfingers, then jam. . .
"
5574,". . .then custard,
"
5575,"which I made from scratch. . .
"
5576,". . .then raspberries,
"
5577,"more ladyfingers. . .
"
5578,". . .then beef sautï¿½ed
"
5579,"with peas and onions. . .
"
5580,". . .then a little bit more custard. . .
"
5581,". . .then bananas and then
"
5582,"I put whipped cream on top.
"
5583,"What was the one right before bananas?
"
5584,"The beef.
"
5585,"Yeah, that was weird to me too.
"
5586,"But then I thought,
"
5587,"""Well, there's minced meat pie. ""
"
5588,"That's an English dessert.
"
5589,"These people just put
"
5590,"strange things in their food.
"
5591,"Can I borrow rum from your place?
"
5592,"Yeah, sure.
"
5593,"While I'm gone,
"
5594,"don't you sneak a taste.
"
5595,"Beef in a dessert?
"
5596,"No, no, no. There is no way.
"
5597,"I know. And only one layer of jam?
"
5598,"What is up with that?
"
5599,"Oh, my God.
"
5600,"The pages are stuck together.
"
5601,"Chandler!
"
5602,"Oh, my God. She made
"
5603,"half an English trifle and. . .
"
5604,". . .half a shepherd's pie!
"
5605,"Man, now she's gonna start all over.
"
5606,"We're never gonna get to introduce
"
5607,"the hot girls to the New World.
"
5608,"No, no, we will.
"
5609,"We just won't tell her she messed up.
"
5610,"Just let her serve
"
5611,"the beef-custard thing?
"
5612,"Yeah. It'll be like
"
5613,"a funny Thanksgiving story.
"
5614,"Vomiting stories are funny, I guess.
"
5615,"Joey. God, your apartment
"
5616,"is like a hundred degrees.
"
5617,"Did it make you want
"
5618,"to walk around in your underwear?
"
5619,"No.
"
5620,"Still not hot enough!
"
5621,"Rachel. Okay, look at him.
"
5622,"Look at those strong hands.
"
5623,"Oh, what I wouldn't give
"
5624,"to be that can of condensed milk.
"
5625,"Chandler was just saying
"
5626,"how beautiful your sweater is.
"
5627,"Thank you. I just bought it.
"
5628,"Yes, well, it's very beautiful and
"
5629,"it's cream-colored and tight and. . . .
"
5630,"I don't mean tight. It's not tight.
"
5631,"Not that I was looking at. . . .
"
5632,"What's the matter with him?
"
5633,"I think he's stoned again.
"
5634,"What?
"
5635,"I need to talk to you.
"
5636,"I think I might know why
"
5637,"my parents don't like you.
"
5638,"Why?
"
5639,"Okay, remember we were young.
"
5640,"Spring break, sophomore year,
"
5641,"I got high in my bedroom. . .
"
5642,". . .and my parents walked in
"
5643,"and smelled it. . .
"
5644,". . .so I told them that you had gotten
"
5645,"stoned and jumped out the window.
"
5646,"Why did you do that?
"
5647,"I don't know. Yours was the first
"
5648,"name that popped into my head.
"
5649,"I didn't think it'd matter.
"
5650,"How could it not matter?
"
5651,"How was I to know
"
5652,"we'd be friends after college. . .
"
5653,". . .and you'd be living with my sister?
"
5654,"What about all that
"
5655,"""friends forever"" stuff?
"
5656,"I don't know. I was all high.
"
5657,"Mom and Dad sent me to find out
"
5658,"if you were trying to get Ross stoned.
"
5659,"Your parents caught Ross smoking pot
"
5660,"in college, and he blamed it on me!
"
5661,"I can't believe you!
"
5662,"We haven't told them we're together
"
5663,"because they hate me, so fix this.
"
5664,"Okay, okay, I'll tell them
"
5665,"it wasn't Chandler who got high.
"
5666,"Now, who should I say it was?
"
5667,"You! It's not like it's a big deal.
"
5668,"You don't still do it or anything.
"
5669,"All right. Now, who should I say
"
5670,"tricked me into doing it?
"
5671,"Dad, please don't pick
"
5672,"your teeth out here.
"
5673,"And if you're gonna put your feet up--
"
5674,"Leave him alone!
"
5675,"Will you hurry up?
"
5676,"Did you not hear me when I told you
"
5677,"that Janine's friends are dancers?
"
5678,"And that they're gonna
"
5679,"be drinking a lot?
"
5680,"No, I did. But tell me again
"
5681,"because it's so romantic.
"
5682,"You're whipping so slow.
"
5683,"Do it faster!
"
5684,"I don't want to make any mistakes!
"
5685,"If I screw it up,
"
5686,"everybody's gonna be like:
"
5687,"""Oh, remember that Thanksgiving
"
5688,"when Rachel screwed up the trifle?""
"
5689,"Just let me worry about making it,
"
5690,"and you just worry about eating it.
"
5691,"Oh, I am.
"
5692,"-If you don't tell them, then I will.
"
5693,"-Okay. Fine.
"
5694,"Ross, can I talk to you for a second?
"
5695,"Can it wait? I have
"
5696,"to tell my parents something.
"
5697,"No, it can't? Okay.
"
5698,"We have to tell Rachel
"
5699,"she messed up her dessert.
"
5700,"What? What is with everybody?
"
5701,"It's Thanksgiving, not. . .
"
5702,". . .Truth Day!
"
5703,"Look, when everyone eats
"
5704,"that banana-meat thing. . .
"
5705,". . .they'll all make fun of her.
"
5706,"Do you want that?
"
5707,"We'll just get everyone
"
5708,"to act like they like it.
"
5709,"That way, no one makes fun of her. . .
"
5710,". . .and we still get to go
"
5711,"to sweet potato pie.
"
5712,"Dude, they're not objects.
"
5713,"Just kidding. I'll talk to them.
"
5714,"You distract her.
"
5715,"Hey, Rach, can I talk to you
"
5716,"outside for a sec?
"
5717,"Okay.
"
5718,"What's up, Ross?
"
5719,"So. . . .
"
5720,"Thanksgiving.
"
5721,"The holiday season is upon us.
"
5722,"And. . .
"
5723,". . .you look nice today.
"
5724,"-Oh, no. No, Ross, don't do this.
"
5725,"-What?
"
5726,"I don't think us getting back
"
5727,"together is a good idea.
"
5728,"I thought this might happen today.
"
5729,"I know the holidays can be rough. . .
"
5730,". . .and it's probably hard
"
5731,"for you to be alone right now.
"
5732,"You're alone.
"
5733,"No, I live with Phoebe.
"
5734,"I mean, you're alone-alone.
"
5735,"And it's just not the time
"
5736,"for us. I'm sorry.
"
5737,"Oh, well.
"
5738,"Can't blame a guy for trying.
"
5739,"And if anyone needs help
"
5740,"pretending to like it. . .
"
5741,". . .I learned some things in acting
"
5742,"class. Try rubbing your stomach.
"
5743,"Or saying ""Mmm. ""
"
5744,"Smiling.
"
5745,"I'm not gonna pay
"
5746,"for those acting classes anymore.
"
5747,"Rachel, there you are.
"
5748,"Let's serve that dessert already!
"
5749,"Joey, you have to stop rushing me.
"
5750,"You don't get any dessert.
"
5751,"Really?
"
5752,"No, just kidding.
"
5753,"I would never do that to you.
"
5754,"Okay, everybody, it's trifle time.
"
5755,"So, Rach, this is a traditional
"
5756,"English trifle, isn't it?
"
5757,"-It sure is.
"
5758,"-Wow.
"
5759,"So did you make it
"
5760,"with beef or eggplant?
"
5761,"-Beef.
"
5762,"-I can't have any. I don't eat meat.
"
5763,"Monica, I want you
"
5764,"to have the first taste.
"
5765,"Really?
"
5766,"Wait, you only got whipped cream.
"
5767,"You gotta take a bite
"
5768,"with all the layers.
"
5769,"You dropped a pea.
"
5770,"Well?
"
5771,"It's good.
"
5772,"Really? How good?
"
5773,"It's so good that I feel selfish. . .
"
5774,". . .about being the only one
"
5775,"who's eating it.
"
5776,"I think we should have everyone
"
5777,"taste how good it is.
"
5778,"Especially Ross.
"
5779,"This is so good that I'm gonna
"
5780,"go enjoy it on the balcony.
"
5781,"So that I can enjoy the view
"
5782,"whilst I enjoy my dessert.
"
5783,"I've gotta call my friend. . .
"
5784,". . .and tell her how good
"
5785,"this is from Monica's room.
"
5786,"I'll help dial.
"
5787,"I'm gonna go into the bathroom. . .
"
5788,". . .so I can look at it
"
5789,"in the mirror as I eat it.
"
5790,"What was that all about?
"
5791,"Does it not taste good?
"
5792,"-Let me try it.
"
5793,"-No, no!
"
5794,"All gone!
"
5795,"So good.
"
5796,"Maybe Chandler has some left.
"
5797,"It tastes like feet.
"
5798,"I like it!
"
5799,"Are you kidding?
"
5800,"What's not to like? Custard, good.
"
5801,"Jam, good. Meat, good.
"
5802,"So a bird just grabbed it. . .
"
5803,". . .and then tried
"
5804,"to fly away with it. . .
"
5805,". . .and then just dropped it
"
5806,"on the street?
"
5807,"If it's any consolation,
"
5808,"before the bird dropped it. . .
"
5809,". . .he seemed to enjoy it.
"
5810,"Rachel, come here.
"
5811,"I was taking my Thanksgiving nap
"
5812,"and I had another dream.
"
5813,"-Do I want to hear this?
"
5814,"-I don't know, let's see.
"
5815,"I dreamt we were getting married. . .
"
5816,". . .and he left because
"
5817,"he had to go fight a fire.
"
5818,"So I went to a nightclub
"
5819,"and I saw him making out with a girl.
"
5820,"Oh, my God, he dream-cheated on you!
"
5821,"But then Jacques Cousteau came. . .
"
5822,". . .and he kicked his ass
"
5823,"for betraying me.
"
5824,"So cool!
"
5825,"Then he took me diving
"
5826,"and introduced me to his sea horse. . .
"
5827,". . .who was coming on to me.
"
5828,"Please, that is not gonna happen.
"
5829,"Boy, I'm glad I wore
"
5830,"the big belt today.
"
5831,"Five minutes ago, a line like that
"
5832,"would have floored me.
"
5833,"But now, nothing. Well, not nothing.
"
5834,"I am still a woman.
"
5835,"Ross? Let's go.
"
5836,"Oh, yeah.
"
5837,"About telling Mom and Dad. . .
"
5838,". . .I was thinking about
"
5839,"maybe writing a letter.
"
5840,"That's it. You've had your chance.
"
5841,"Mom, Dad. Ross smoked pot in college.
"
5842,"You are such a tattletale!
"
5843,"Mom, Dad. . .
"
5844,". . .you remember that time
"
5845,"you walked in my room. . .
"
5846,". . .and smelled marijuana?
"
5847,"Yes.
"
5848,"I told you it was Chandler. . .
"
5849,". . .who was smoking the pot but. . .
"
5850,". . .it was me. I'm sorry.
"
5851,"It was you?
"
5852,"Dad, you know that mailman
"
5853,"that you got fired?
"
5854,"He didn't steal your Playboys.
"
5855,"Ross did.
"
5856,"Well, Hurricane Gloria didn't break
"
5857,"the porch swing. Monica did!
"
5858,"Ross hasn't worked
"
5859,"at the museum for a year!
"
5860,"Monica and Chandler
"
5861,"are living together!
"
5862,"Ross married Rachel in Vegas!
"
5863,"And got divorced! Again!
"
5864,"I love Jacques Cousteau!
"
5865,"I wasn't supposed
"
5866,"to put beef in the trifle!
"
5867,"I want to go!
"
5868,"That's a lot of information
"
5869,"to get in 30 seconds.
"
5870,"All right. Joey, if you want
"
5871,"to leave, just leave.
"
5872,"Rachel, no, you weren't supposed
"
5873,"to put beef in the trifle.
"
5874,"It did not taste good.
"
5875,"Phoebe, I'm sorry. . .
"
5876,". . .but I think
"
5877,"Jacques Cousteau is dead.
"
5878,"Monica, why you felt
"
5879,"you had to hide the fact. . .
"
5880,". . .that you're in an important
"
5881,"relationship is beyond me.
"
5882,"And we kind of figured
"
5883,"about the porch swing.
"
5884,"Ross.
"
5885,"Drugs?
"
5886,"Divorced again?
"
5887,"What happened, son?
"
5888,"I got tricked into all those things.
"
5889,"Chandler, you've been
"
5890,"Ross' best friend all these years. . .
"
5891,". . .stuck by him
"
5892,"during the drug problems. . .
"
5893,". . .and now you've taken on
"
5894,"Monica as well.
"
5895,"Well, I don't know what to say.
"
5896,"You're a wonderful human being.
"
5897,"-Thank you!
"
5898,"-No.
"
5899,"Thank you!
"
5900,"Monica and Ross, I don't know what
"
5901,"I'm gonna do about the two of you.
"
5902,"I'll talk to them.
"
5903,"You guys, it was bananas. . .
"
5904,". . .cream and beef!
"
5905,"I just cannot believe that you ate
"
5906,"that so that I wouldn't feel bad.
"
5907,"Well, actually, I didn't eat mine.
"
5908,"It's still in the bathroom.
"
5909,"No, I ate that.
"
5910,"And we left ours in Monica's bedroom.
"
5911,"Nope, got it and got yours too.
"

"
5916,"That's a good story, Grandpa.
"
5917,"Wow. Monica's letting other people
"
5918,"help decorate her tree?
"
5919,"Did someone get her

"
5921,"Having a perfect tree is

5942,"that you started telling this story.
"
5943,"-Hey, you guys.
"
5944,"-Hey. What's up?
"
5945,"I had to get out of the apartment.
"
5946,"Janine's stretching all over the place.

"

5997,"I gotta run. I'll catch you later.
"
5998,"Bye, Janine.
"
5999,"Did she just ask me out on a date?
"
6000,"I don't think so.
"
6001,"She invited him to the biggest
"
6002,"party of the millennium.
"
6003,"Yeah, but she also invited
"
6004,"you and Ross.
"
6005,"I'm sorry, I don't think that
"
6006,"that was a romantic thing.
"
6007,"Well, maybe.
"
6008,"But, hey, I know how I can find out.
"
6009,"It's a New Year's Eve party.
"
6010,"So at midnight, I can kiss her.
"
6011,"And if she kisses me back, great.
"
6012,"If she says, ""What are you doing?""
"
6013,"I can say, ""It wasn't me,
"
6014,"it was New Year's. ""
"
6015,"That's better than Ross
"
6016,"kissing me in high school. . .
"
6017,". . .and saying that he did it
"
6018,"because he needed Chap Stick.
"
6019,"It was a dry day.
"
6020,"We are going to Dick Clark's
"
6021,"New Year's Rockin ' Eve!
"
6022,"Oh, my God!
"
6023,"Oh, my God!
"
6024,"Oh, my God!
"
6025,"Okay, I've been on sets before. . .
"
6026,". . .so let me give you some advice.
"
6027,"It's a show, but we're just dancing.
"
6028,"It's no big deal.
"
6029,"Important thing to remember:
"
6030,"Stay cool.
"
6031,"-Got it.
"
6032,"-Okay.
"
6033,"Oh, my God!
"
6034,"It's just like I dreamed it!
"
6035,"Everyone! Gather up!
"
6036,"-Excuse us!
"
6037,"-Excuse us!
"
6038,"The music's gonna start,
"
6039,"you're gonna dance. . .
"
6040,". . .we'll tape it. Don't look
"
6041,"at the camera. Questions?
"
6042,"Yeah, I have a question.
"
6043,"When is this gonna air?
"
6044,"Yeah. Now, you guys dance
"
6045,"over there. . .
"
6046,". . .you guys, over there.
"
6047,"I want you two here.
"
6048,"And everyone else, spread out.
"
6049,"So when is it gonna air?
"
6050,"You look in the kitchen,
"
6051,"I got the closet.
"
6052,"I can save you time, ladies.
"
6053,"I'm right here.
"
6054,"Yeah. Why don't you take a walk?
"
6055,"This doesn't concern you.
"
6056,"We're looking for our presents
"
6057,"from Monica.
"
6058,"That's terrible.
"
6059,"No, we do it every year.
"
6060,"Oh, well, that makes it not terrible.
"
6061,"Yeah, we never find them.
"
6062,"She's always bested us,
"
6063,"that wily. . .minx.
"
6064,"We'll search here for an hour. . .
"
6065,". . .and then we'll go to Joey's
"
6066,"and search, okay?
"
6067,"-You can't look for Monica's presents.
"
6068,"-We have to.
"
6069,"You don't have to. And you can't,
"
6070,"because I live here too.
"
6071,"Well, then you should look with us.
"
6072,"Why?
"
6073,"Aren't you worried about
"
6074,"what to get Monica?
"
6075,"No, I have a great idea
"
6076,"for her present.
"
6077,"Oh, that's it?
"
6078,"A great idea? Oh, yeah?
"
6079,"What if she gets you
"
6080,"a great present. . .
"
6081,". . .two mediums
"
6082,"and lots of little ones. . .
"
6083,". . .and you just get her one present?
"
6084,"She'll feel bad.
"
6085,"Why would you do that to her?
"
6086,"Why? Why?
"
6087,"-If I help, we can find them faster!
"
6088,"-Right!
"
6089,"We have a live one!
"
6090,"-Oh, it's a Macy's bag!
"
6091,"-Yeah.
"
6092,"Who's it for?
"
6093,"""Dear Losers, do you really think
"
6094,"I'd hide presents under the couch?
"
6095,"P.S. Chandler,
"
6096,"I knew they'd break you. ""
"
6097,"Uh-oh. She may be onto us.
"
6098,"We are so gonna find them this year.
"
6099,"You said you'd go across the hall
"
6100,"and look. Do you do that every year?
"
6101,"Yeah.
"
6102,"You don't go into the back
"
6103,"of my closet. . .
"
6104,". . .and look under my gym bag
"
6105,"or anything?
"
6106,"-No. Never do that.
"
6107,"-No.
"
6108,"That's where Joey gave me stuff
"
6109,"to store that I've never seen.
"
6110,"Okay, that did not just happen.
"
6111,"Here comes a camera.
"
6112,"Right. No biggie. Stay loose.
"
6113,"Why do they keep doing that?
"
6114,"We have to get up on one
"
6115,"of those platforms.
"
6116,"They've been taping them all day.
"
6117,"Right.
"
6118,"What'd you guys do
"
6119,"to get up on there?
"
6120,"We learned how to dance.
"
6121,"When you learned to dance, did you
"
6122,"forget how to put on underpants?
"
6123,"Yeah!
"
6124,"-Hey, you're a good dancer.
"
6125,"-Really?
"
6126,"You'd be better if you
"
6127,"loosened your hips.
"
6128,"-What do you mean?
"
6129,"-Like this.
"
6130,"That's it. Feel the rhythm.
"
6131,"That's better.
"
6132,"You're dancing with her.
"
6133,"-We're together.
"
6134,"-Yeah, we came together.
"
6135,"I don't see it.
"
6136,"You are dancing with the tall guy.
"
6137,"Tall Guy, raise your hand!
"
6138,"Hey, buddy. Let me dance with her.
"
6139,"I like her and I think I have a shot.
"
6140,"Really, you think so? I don't.
"
6141,"I couldn't find anything--
"
6142,"Hey, wait!
"
6143,"Yeah, we found them.
"
6144,"They were in the guest room closet.
"
6145,"You have nothing to worry about
"
6146,"because they're crap.
"
6147,"Those are mine.
"
6148,"I got those for you.
"
6149,"Oh. Thanks, Chandler, they're great!
"
6150,"Chandler, what is this very weird
"
6151,"metal A-Z thing?
"
6152,"Those are bookends.
"
6153,"That's a great gift.
"
6154,"Oh. Okay, I'm sorry.
"
6155,"Thank you for my ""az. ""
"
6156,"Make sure you put all that stuff
"
6157,"back in the closet.
"
6158,"Yes, okay.
"
6159,"By the way, I think it's really nice
"
6160,"of you that even after you moved. . .
"
6161,". . .you still keep storing
"
6162,"that stuff for Joey.
"
6163,"Hey, dancing girl?
"
6164,"Can I go to the bathroom?
"
6165,"Here we go. Yeah.
"
6166,"Looking good, Gellers!
"
6167,"We know!
"
6168,"That snippy guy's the one who
"
6169,"decides who gets on the platform.
"
6170,"-We should go dance by him.
"
6171,"-Okay.
"
6172,"Okay, everybody, hold!
"
6173,"Next on the platforms are. . . .
"
6174,"You two! And. . . .
"
6175,"-You two!
"
6176,"-Cool!
"
6177,"Excuse me? Sir?
"
6178,"Would it help if I weren't
"
6179,"wearing underpants?
"
6180,"Would it?
"
6181,"Hey, Tall Guy!
"
6182,"I want to talk to you about that girl
"
6183,"you're dancing with.
"
6184,"She's nice, huh? To think I almost
"
6185,"brought my wife to this.
"
6186,"Yeah. Yeah. Okay.
"
6187,"Look, I came with that girl, okay?
"
6188,"I plan to kiss her
"
6189,"at the New Year's countdown.
"
6190,"I'm trying to win her over. I--
"
6191,"I don't think so.
"
6192,"You can dance with my partner.
"
6193,"She's real mellow.
"
6194,"Look, you dating this girl
"
6195,"you came with?
"
6196,"I was hoping after tonight
"
6197,"that maybe. . . .
"
6198,"No. No. She's fair game
"
6199,"if you ask me. Sorry, buddy.
"
6200,"All right. Hey.
"
6201,"Fair is fair. When you're right,
"
6202,"you're right. What can I say?
"
6203,"Are you in second grade?
"
6204,"Hey, man. You're the one
"
6205,"who wet his pants.
"
6206,"Man, this sucks.
"
6207,"If Mom and Dad don't see us
"
6208,"on TV after we made them jealous. . .
"
6209,". . .then who's gonna be
"
6210,"the losers then?
"
6211,"I know what'll get us up
"
6212,"on a platform.
"
6213,"What?
"
6214,"The routine!
"
6215,"We haven't done the routine
"
6216,"since middle school.
"
6217,"When the snippy guy
"
6218,"sees the routine. . .
"
6219,". . .he'll want to build us
"
6220,"our own platform.
"
6221,"Was it that good?
"
6222,"We got honorable mention in the
"
6223,"brother/sister dance category!
"
6224,"It's almost fake midnight.
"
6225,"Do we really have any other choice?
"
6226,"Okay, let's do it.
"
6227,"Mom and Dad are gonna be so faced!
"
6228,"Five, six, seven, eight!
"
6229,"So, do we really need to ask who's
"
6230,"going up on the platform next?
"
6231,"You get up there and do that
"
6232,"again, exactly like that.
"
6233,"Get this. Dick will want
"
6234,"it for the Bloopers show.
"
6235,"All right, cut!
"
6236,"Listen up, everyone!
"
6237,"When we start,
"
6238,"it'll be the countdown. . .
"
6239,". . .so I want to see
"
6240,"everybody's excitement!
"
6241,"Hey, guy!
"
6242,"You got three seconds to get away.
"
6243,"What's going on here?
"
6244,"Take a look at the guy's pants!
"
6245,"You told us to show excitement,
"
6246,"but don't you think he went overboard?
"
6247,"What's the matter with you? Go!
"
6248,"Yeah, take a hike, wet pants!
"
6249,"Can you believe this?
"
6250,"We're on the platform
"
6251,"for the millennial moment!
"
6252,"I know!
"
6253,"You haven't been practicing
"
6254,"the routine, have you?
"
6255,"No.
"
6256,"Me too!
"
6257,"When the music starts. . .
"
6258,". . .I was thinking about maybe
"
6259,"going into the robot.
"
6260,"Ross? We should stick to the routine.
"
6261,"We don't want to look stupid.
"
6262,"All right, we're back!
"
6263,"Ten seconds left.
"
6264,"-Ten.
"
6265,"-Nine, eight.
"
6266,"Seven.
"
6267,"Okay, it all comes down to this.
"
6268,"Whatever happens, happens.
"
6269,"Destiny.
"
6270,"--three, two, one!
"
6271,"-Cut!
"
6272,"-No!
"
6273,"--year!
"
6274,"Happy No Year!
"
6275,"Now we go to the live shot
"
6276,"of Times Square. That's a wrap!
"
6277,"Hey, look who I found.
"
6278,"Oh, hi, guys!
"
6279,"Birds have a very good
"
6280,"sense of direction.
"
6281,"I thought maybe they could help us
"
6282,"find the presents.
"
6283,"Yes, if the presents are hidden
"
6284,"south for the winter.
"
6285,"Or we could just follow your clever
"
6286,"jokes. Any ideas? Didn't think so.
"
6287,"Come on, show us where
"
6288,"the presents are.
"
6289,"The duck seems to think that
"
6290,"Monica got me garbage.
"
6291,"I wonder what I could get Monica
"
6292,"that's as good as garbage.
"
6293,"How about my ""az""?
"
6294,"Hey. This is hollow.
"
6295,"What?
"
6296,"This bench, it's hollow.
"
6297,"I can't believe I never knew that!
"
6298,"-Oh, the presents!
"
6299,"-Don't look directly at them!
"
6300,"What?
"
6301,"All right, no, we could look at them.
"
6302,"This one's for me!
"
6303,"This one's for Chandler. Here.
"
6304,"-And the big one's for me!
"
6305,"-Oh, let's open them!
"
6306,"-Wait a minute. We can't do this.
"
6307,"-Why?
"
6308,"I don't want to know
"
6309,"what Monica got me.
"
6310,"I'm sure she worked hard at getting it
"
6311,"and wanting to surprise me.
"
6312,"And you guys are gonna ruin that.
"
6313,"We have to put them back.
"
6314,"This isn't what Christmas is about.
"
6315,"Whatever, Linus.
"
6316,"I'm opening mine.
"
6317,"Nobody is opening anything, okay?
"
6318,"I want to see the look on her face
"
6319,"when I give her my present.
"
6320,"I'm sure she wants to see the look
"
6321,"on my face when I get mine.
"
6322,"So, please, please, can we just. . .?
"
6323,"Can we put them back?
"
6324,"-Will you get us better gifts?
"
6325,"-Fine.
"
6326,"Hey, guys.
"
6327,"You found the presents?
"
6328,"You let them find the presents?
"
6329,"Great.
"
6330,"Do you know how long it took me
"
6331,"to find you that water purifier?
"
6332,"-That's what you got me?
"
6333,"-Yes, I see. That look is priceless.
"
6334,"Home sweet home, huh?
"
6335,"Nice to get back to reality.
"
6336,"Plus, we know how the New Year's
"
6337,"gonna go off.
"
6338,"I guess there's no reason for all
"
6339,"that Y2K panic, you know?
"
6340,"Anyway, good night.
"
6341,"-Joey?
"
6342,"-Yeah?
"
6343,"Three. . .
"
6344,". . .two, one.
"
6345,"Happy New Year.
"
6346,"What was that for?
"
6347,"Tonight when they yelled ""cut""
"
6348,"and we didn't get to kiss. . .
"
6349,". . .I was really, really disappointed,
"
6350,"and I just. . . .
"
6351,"I just really wanted to kiss you.
"
6352,"Really?
"
6353,"In the moment, I really wanted
"
6354,"to kiss you too. In the moment.
"
6355,"-In the moment.
"
6356,"-But only in the moment.
"
6357,"So do you want to kiss again?
"
6358,"Sure. New Year's Eve
"
6359,"is only two weeks away.
"
6360,"Can you wait?
"
6361,"No.
"
6362,"Me neither.
"
6363,"Three, two. . . .
"
6364,"You don't have to count down
"
6365,"every time we kiss.
"
6366,"Oh. Okay.
"
6367,"Except I sort of felt like I needed
"
6368,"a couple seconds to get ready.
"
6369,"We were on the platform, ready to
"
6370,"dance into the new millennium. . .
"
6371,". . .and the guy yells ""cut! ""
"
6372,"So you guys are telling me
"
6373,"that you actually did. . .
"
6374,". . .the routine from eighth grade?
"
6375,"Yeah! But of course we had
"
6376,"to update it a little bit.
"
6377,"Hey, by the way, quick thinking
"
6378,"about catching me.
"
6379,"There's no way you could've
"
6380,"done the end. . .
"
6381,". . .the way you guys did it back then.
"
6382,"What? We could do it.
"
6383,"I don't know. You were a lot bigger--
"
6384,"I mean, stronger back then.
"
6385,"I can do it, okay?
"
6386,"Come on, let's go! Come on.
"
6387,"One, two, three, four. . .

"
6400,". . .that I just kissed her!
"
6401,"-Are you serious?
"
6402,"-That's great!

6455,"This has a story behind it.
"
6456,"They had to ship it all the way
"
6457,"from the White Plains store.
"
6458,"It's got to be one-of-a-kind.
"
6459,"Like that God-awful ceramic fruit
"
6460,"bowl she has on her counter?
"
6461,"Hey! I made that for her.
"
6462,"-You made pottery?
"
6463,"-Yeah.
"
6464,"I made it out of a fruit bowl
"
6465,"I found in the garbage.
"
6466,"If you put that in her apartment,
"
6467,"you'll never hear the end of it.
"
6468,"I'll tell her that it's an antique.
"
6469,"She doesn't have to know
"
6470,"where it came from.
"
6471,"I love these little drawers.
"
6472,"Oh, look! It says that
"
6473,"it holds 300 CDs.
"
6474,"Just like the apothecary tables
"
6475,"of yore.
"
6476,"So the farmer says:
"
6477,"""That's not a cow,
"
6478,"and you're not milking. ""
"
6479,"I'm so glad you're together.
"
6480,"We wanted a couple to go out with
"
6481,"and now we have one.
"
6482,"We're a couple of couples.
"
6483,"I had so much fun tonight.
"
6484,"What a great restaurant!
"
6485,"And Chandler, I can't believe
"
6486,"I let you pay for this one.
"
6487,"Thanks again, man.
"
6488,"If you come over tomorrow,
"
6489,"I'll make pasta.
"
6490,"-That'd be great!
"
6491,"-Okay.
"
6492,"But at least let us
"
6493,"bring the wine.
"
6494,"-You don't have to.
"
6495,"-I insist.
"
6496,"-You'll get the wine, right?
"
6497,"-Yeah.
"
6498,"-Okay, good night.
"
6499,"-See you tomorrow.
"
6500,"Can't wait.
"
6501,"How are we going to get
"
6502,"out of that one?
"
6503,"I can't handle two
"
6504,"nights in a row with them.
"
6505,"What's wrong with them?
"
6506,"They're just a little. . .
"
6507,". . .blah!
"
6508,"Blah?
"
6509,"Well, you know, he's blah.
"
6510,"She's just. . . .
"
6511,"She's very loud for such
"
6512,"a small person.
"
6513,"They're my best friends.
"
6514,"Are you saying we can't go out?
"
6515,"'Cause that'd be a problem.
"
6516,"Of course we can still
"
6517,"hang out with them.
"
6518,"Just not two nights in a row.
"
6519,"-Okay?
"
6520,"-I guess.
"
6521,"Thank you.
"
6522,"I'll sell my friends and use
"
6523,"the money to buy you presents.
"
6524,"What a great table!
"
6525,"Where did you get it?
"
6526,"Guess.
"
6527,"A flea market?
"
6528,"I knew you would get it
"
6529,"on the first guess.
"
6530,"Isn't it cool?
"
6531,"It's an apothecary table.
"
6532,"You can just imagine
"
6533,"that this is where. . .
"
6534,". . .they kept all their stuff
"
6535,"to make potions.
"
6536,"You can almost smell the opium.
"
6537,"Almost.
"
6538,"How much was it?
"
6539,"Just only 500 bucks.
"
6540,"500 bucks at a flea market?
"
6541,"I thought you meant how much was it. . .
"
6542,". . .when it was new, back then.
"
6543,"It was at a flea market,
"
6544,"so it was like a dollar.
"
6545,"-A dollar?
"
6546,"-And fifty?
"
6547,"So it was like
"
6548,"one and fifty dollars.
"
6549,"-They gave you the old-time pricing.
"
6550,"-Yeah.
"
6551,"Well, what period is it from?
"
6552,"It's from yore.
"
6553,"Like, the ""days of yore,"" you know?
"
6554,"Yes, I do.
"
6555,"-It's just perfect.
"
6556,"-Oh, good.
"
6557,"I bet it has a great story too.
"
6558,"Did they tell you
"
6559,"where it's from or. . . .
"
6560,"Yes, that I know.
"
6561,"This is from White Plains.
"
6562,"White Plains.
"
6563,"It sounds like such a magical place.
"
6564,"-I'm here.
"
6565,"-Hi!
"
6566,"Oh, my God!
"
6567,"-You like it?
"
6568,"-Oh, my God!
"
6569,"It's my new apothecary table!
"
6570,"Phoebe'll be here any second.
"
6571,"She can't see this.
"
6572,"Why not? She'll love it.
"
6573,"It's the real thing.
"
6574,"I got it at Pottery Barn.
"
6575,"I know. I bought the same one.
"
6576,"And if she sees your table,
"
6577,"she'll know I lied.
"
6578,"-I said ours was an original.
"
6579,"-Why?
"
6580,"Because she hates Pottery Barn.
"
6581,"She hates Pottery Barn?
"
6582,"She says it's all mass-produced. . .
"
6583,". . .nothing is authentic, and everyone
"
6584,"winds up having the same stuff.
"
6585,"So come on!
"
6586,"Can we cover this up, please?
"
6587,"I am not gonna hide it from Phoebe.
"
6588,"Although I did get some great
"
6589,"Pottery Barn sheets.
"
6590,"I forgot they made sheets!
"
6591,"I still can't believe
"
6592,"she hates Pottery Barn.
"
6593,"It's not like she hates you.
"
6594,"Yeah, but Pottery Barn?
"
6595,"You know what I think?
"
6596,"She's just weird.
"
6597,"It's because she's a twin.
"
6598,"Twins are weird.
"
6599,"She's not weird. She likes
"
6600,"her stuff to be one-of-a-kind.
"
6601,"You know what's not one-of-a-kind?
"
6602,"A twin!
"
6603,"Let's turn out the lights
"
6604,"and watch the movie.
"
6605,"-Hey, cool sheet!
"
6606,"-You like it?
"
6607,"-You want to know where I got it?
"
6608,"-Sure.
"
6609,"At a flea market.
"
6610,"You buy your sheets
"
6611,"at a flea market?
"
6612,"Come on, you gotta loosen the
"
6613,"purse strings a little.
"
6614,"Dinner will be ready in 20 minutes.
"
6615,"Here is the wine to bring
"
6616,"over tonight.
"
6617,"You were also gonna
"
6618,"buy Monica flowers. . .
"
6619,". . .but you couldn't because
"
6620,"you paid for dinner last night.
"
6621,"Thanks. But it's just
"
6622,"gonna be me tonight.
"
6623,"-What happened to Janine?
"
6624,"-She's really sick.
"
6625,"-That's too bad.
"
6626,"-Yeah, she's been in there all day.
"
6627,"High fever, nose problem.
"
6628,"It's. . .
"
6629,". . .phlegm, phlegm,
"
6630,"phlegm, phlegm, phlegm.
"
6631,"Monica! Chandler!
"
6632,"I'm sorry about tonight. I don't
"
6633,"know if Joey told you. . .
"
6634,". . .but I couldn't get out
"
6635,"of going to this play.
"
6636,"Have a great time, huh?
"
6637,"That's funny, I saw no phlegm.
"
6638,"Oh, no, she really is sick.
"
6639,"Then why is she going to a play?
"
6640,"Well, you know, ""Starve a fever. . .
"
6641,". . .go to a play for a cold. ""
"
6642,"Why is Janine not coming
"
6643,"over for dinner?
"
6644,"She didn't want to hang out with
"
6645,"you guys two nights in a row.
"
6646,"I'm so sorry.
"
6647,"Why doesn't she want
"
6648,"to hang out with us?
"
6649,"Because she thinks that
"
6650,"you are ""blah. ""
"
6651,"And that you, Monica,
"
6652,"are too loud.
"
6653,"What?!
"
6654,"What?
"
6655,"So she just pretended to
"
6656,"have a good time?
"
6657,"She was lying to our faces?
"
6658,"I can't believe this.
"
6659,"Who is she to judge us?
"
6660,"-We couldn't have been nicer to her.
"
6661,"-And I am not ""blah. "" I am a hoot!
"
6662,"Come on, please, you guys.
"
6663,"Don't be mad.
"
6664,"I'm sure she said it. . .
"
6665,". . .because she was nervous 'cause
"
6666,"you're my best friends.
"
6667,"And it was our first date.
"
6668,"Plus, she's really sick.
"
6669,"You said you made that up!
"
6670,"But isn't the ""sick"" thing
"
6671,"better than the ""play"" thing?
"
6672,"They're both good. I generally just
"
6673,"go with, ""Monica's drunk again. ""
"
6674,"Come on, please just
"
6675,"give her another chance.
"
6676,"-She'll come around, I promise.
"
6677,"-Of course we will.
"
6678,"-Come on, we gotta make dinner.
"
6679,"-Okay.
"
6680,"I do not like that woman!
"
6681,"I can hear you!
"
6682,"I am loud!
"
6683,"Can you please not put your
"
6684,"feet up on my new. . .
"
6685,". . .old sheet.
"
6686,"Oh, sure.
"
6687,"My apothecary table!
"
6688,"-What?
"
6689,"-No!
"
6690,"-Where did you get this?
"
6691,"-At Pottery Barn, okay?
"
6692,"Oh, my God!
"
6693,"Pottery Barn has ripped off
"
6694,"the design of our antique!
"
6695,"If they've ripped off our table. . .
"
6696,". . .ours must be worth much more
"
6697,"than one and fifty dollars.
"
6698,"This doesn't even
"
6699,"smell like opium.
"
6700,"It smells like wine,
"
6701,"which you spilled.
"
6702,"And thanks for wrecking my sheet.
"
6703,"Ross, calm down. I'll give
"
6704,"you the 80 cents.
"
6705,"Okay, one more time.
"
6706,"Would you like some orange juice?
"
6707,"-Perfect decibel.
"
6708,"-I know!
"
6709,"What are you guys doing?
"
6710,"Nothing. We're just talking.
"
6711,"You know, blah-blah-blah.
"
6712,"Come on, you said you were gonna try.
"
6713,"I came over to invite you to
"
6714,"a movie with me and Janine.
"
6715,"-What do you say?
"
6716,"-I'd like to. . .
"
6717,". . .but I'm not sure if
"
6718,"we have the time.
"
6719,"Very funny. I don't know
"
6720,"what to do.
"
6721,"I really want you to get along.
"
6722,"Please, come to the movie with us.
"
6723,"You owe me.
"
6724,"-We owe you?
"
6725,"-That's right.
"
6726,"I helped you out in the
"
6727,"start of your relationship.
"
6728,"I helped you sneak around
"
6729,"for six months.
"
6730,"I looked like an idiot.
"
6731,"And I was humiliated.
"
6732,"And I only made $200.
"
6733,"We didn't give you any money.
"
6734,"You don't think I know that?
"
6735,"I can't decide if it goes
"
6736,"better by the new chair. . .
"
6737,". . .the Sahara desk. . .
"
6738,". . .or the Parker console table.
"
6739,"I didn't know there was
"
6740,"a Pottery Barn up here.
"
6741,"-I know, I went a little crazy.
"
6742,"-A little?
"
6743,"Your place looks like page 72
"
6744,"of the catalog.
"
6745,"Look at that!
"
6746,"The ornamental birdcage!
"
6747,"Large.
"
6748,"Oh, Ross? Be careful.
"
6749,"That is very old.
"
6750,"Colonial bird merchants used to
"
6751,"bring their birds to market in that.
"
6752,"Fascinating.
"
6753,"Another amazing find!
"
6754,"-I bet this has a great story too.
"
6755,"-It does.
"
6756,"It is a room-separating apparatus
"
6757,"from Colonial times.
"
6758,"A lot of this stuff is from
"
6759,"the Colonial times.
"
6760,"What are some other
"
6761,"time periods, Rachel?
"
6762,"Well, there's yore.
"
6763,"And, you know, yesteryear.
"
6764,"Rachel has such a
"
6765,"good eye for this stuff.
"
6766,"Ross, if you ever decide
"
6767,"to redecorate--
"
6768,"--and I think you should--
"
6769,"--you should ask Rachel to help.
"
6770,"He doesn't need my help.
"
6771,"I think he's ready to get rid
"
6772,"of the-- What'd you call it?
"
6773,"The ""cheap knockoffs
"
6774,"and dinosaur junk""?
"
6775,"Really?
"
6776,"You know, since you have such a
"
6777,"great sense of what I need--
"
6778,"Here's 60 bucks.
"
6779,"Why don't you take Phoebe down
"
6780,"to that Colonial flea market. . .
"
6781,". . .and get me some stuff?
"
6782,"I don't think Phoebe wants to come.
"
6783,"-I do want to.
"
6784,"-She does want to.
"
6785,"-She does want to.
"
6786,"-Yeah!
"
6787,"I guess the flea market was
"
6788,"just better last time.
"
6789,"Well, at least I got these
"
6790,"sheets for Ross.
"
6791,"Ugh, look at this. Pottery Barn.
"
6792,"You know what? Don't look at it.
"
6793,"-Seriously, don't look at it.
"
6794,"-Look!
"
6795,"There's the table
"
6796,"they stole from us.
"
6797,"Oh, those bastards! Let's go.
"
6798,"That fan kind of looks like ours,
"
6799,"and the birdcage, and. . . .
"
6800,"Wait a second, this is our
"
6801,"exact living room!
"
6802,"No, it's not.
"
6803,"Come on, ours is totally different.
"
6804,"I mean, we don't have the--
"
6805,"We don't have that lamp.
"
6806,"And that screen is on
"
6807,"the other side.
"
6808,"Oh, my God. This is where you
"
6809,"got all our stuff.
"
6810,"Pottery Barn! Oh, my God!
"
6811,"Okay, I did, all right?
"
6812,"I'm sorry.
"
6813,"I wanted this stuff and I know
"
6814,"how you feel about Pottery Barn.
"
6815,"-Come on, don't be mad.
"
6816,"-No, but I am mad.
"
6817,"Because this stuff is what's
"
6818,"wrong with the world. . .
"
6819,". . .and it's in my living room. . .
"
6820,". . .and all I can think about is
"
6821,"how I don't have that lamp!
"
6822,"Well, then, honey, buy the lamp.
"
6823,"We have that 60 bucks from Ross.
"
6824,"I can't! I can't!
"
6825,"Unless. . . .
"
6826,"Are you saying you'd move out
"
6827,"if I didn't buy that lamp?
"
6828,"No, I'm not gonna move out!
"
6829,"But are you saying that you would
"
6830,"move out if I didn't buy that lamp?
"
6831,"-Yes! I would so move out.
"
6832,"-Then I don't have a choice.
"
6833,"-I have to buy that lamp!
"
6834,"-That's right.
"
6835,"But at least the apothecary
"
6836,"table's real.
"
6837,"This was great.
"
6838,"Didn't everybody have a great time?
"
6839,"I did. I really did.
"
6840,"And I've got to say. . .
"
6841,". . .I'm sorry if I was weird after
"
6842,"the last time we went out.
"
6843,"I guess I was just nervous.
"
6844,"-That's understandable.
"
6845,"-Don't worry about it.
"
6846,"So we can go out again?
"
6847,"-Absolutely.
"
6848,"-Well, good.
"
6849,"See?
"
6850,"Wasn't that fun?
"
6851,"We have got to move.
"
6852,"What?
"
6853,"I knew it!
"
6854,"You're not so quiet yourself, missy!
"
6855,"I'm blah? The only thing more
"
6856,"boring than modern dance. . .
"
6857,". . .is you talking about it.
"
6858,"""Oh, Chandler, I just lost
"
6859,"myself in the movement. ""
"
6860,"You know, I know you're talking. . .
"
6861,". . .but all I hear is
"
6862,"blah-blah-blah-blah-blah.
"
6863,"All right, you and me!
"
6864,"Let's go, right now!
"
6865,"All right, enough!
"
6866,"Enough! You two, go home.
"
6867,"I gotta talk to Janine.
"
6868,"I really think you could take her.
"
6869,"You better hope I don't
"
6870,"see you in the hallway!
"
6871,"All right.
"
6872,"Look, we got a little bit
"
6873,"of a problem here.
"
6874,"You can't my treat
"
6875,"my friends that way.
"
6876,"-They said stuff to me too.
"
6877,"-I know, I'll talk to them about it.
"
6878,"They mean so much to me.
"
6879,"They're like my family, you know?
"
6880,"If you guys are gonna be
"
6881,"fighting all the time. . . .
"
6882,"I don't think we can be together.
"
6883,"It just can't work, okay?
"
6884,"It can't.
"
6885,"I'm very upset.
"
6886,"Okay.
"
6887,"Would it help if I apologized?
"
6888,"Yeah.
"
6889,"That'd be very helpful.
"
6890,"What did I tell you about the hall?
"
6891,"I was coming over to
"
6892,"apologize for my behavior.
"
6893,"I'd really like it if we
"
6894,"could be friends.
"
6895,"Well, I know that would
"
6896,"make Joey happy, so. . .
"
6897,". . .I would like that too.
"
6898,"-Great.
"
6899,"-Now, come on.
"
6900,"-I'm glad we worked it out.
"
6901,"-Me too.
"
6902,"-I'll see you.
"
6903,"-Bye.
"
6904,"-Or I'll hear you.
"
6905,"-That's it, big girl!
"
6906,"Wait!
"
6907,"You'd better run!
"
6908,"Did you hear that?
"
6909,"-What am I gonna do?
"
6910,"-I'm sorry, man.
"
6911,"-Want to go watch?
"
6912,"-Yeah!
"
6913,"-How you doing?
"
6914,"-So did she move out?
"
6915,"Pretty much.
"
6916,"I can't believe you just
"
6917,"broke up with her.
"
6918,"When it's not right, you know it.
"
6919,"-You okay?
"
6920,"-I'll be all right.
"
6921,"-You know what'd cheer you up?
"
6922,"-What?
"
6923,"I'm giving this lecture on
"
6924,"erosion theories tomorrow night.
"
6925,"I think you should come.
"
6926,"You're right, that did cheer me up.

"
6928,"Hey! You're not gonna believe this.
"
6929,"I made up a joke
"
6930,"and sent it in to Playboy.
"
6931,"They printed it.
"
6932,"I didn't know they print jokes.
"
6933,"They print jokes, interviews,
"
6934,"hard-hitting journalism.
"
6935,"It's not just about the pictures.
"
6936,"Didn't work on Mom,
"
6937,"it's not gonna work on us.
"
6938,"Check it out. It's the first one.
"
6939,"Right there.
"
6940,"That is funny.
"
6941,"It was also funny when I made it up.
"
6942,"-What?
"
6943,"-I made that joke up.
"
6944,"No, you didn't. I did.
"
6945,"Yes, I did. I told Dan and he said it
"
6946,"was the funniest he'd joke ever heard.
"
6947,"Hey, tell Dan thanks.
"
6948,"What?
"
6949,"I was just reading the joke below it.
"
6950,"Man, that one is funny.
"
6951,"Monica, you remember me
"
6952,"telling you that joke, right?
"
6953,"-No.
"
6954,"-Seriously?
"
6955,"You tell a lot of jokes.
"
6956,"Look, it's my joke.
"
6957,"But if it makes you feel better,
"
6958,"they don't print the name.
"
6959,"So it doesn't really matter
"
6960,"who gets credit.
"
6961,"Yeah, I guess.
"
6962,"-Hey, guys.
"
6963,"-Playboy printed my joke!
"
6964,"No, it's mine! Call them!
"
6965,"They'll tell you!
"
6966,"-My joke!
"
6967,"-My joke!
"
6968,"Whoa, whoa, whoa!
"
6969,"Jokes? What. . .?
"
6970,"You know there's naked chicks

"
6977,"The band Heart is having a tough
"
6978,"time and they may break up.
"
6979,"Let's watch that at your place.
"
6980,"Monica's watching a show. I don't
"
6981,"want to miss when they were skinny.
"
6982,"Hey, Chandler?
"
6983,"You know what we should do?
"
6984,"You and I should go out
"
6985,"and get some new sunglasses.
"
6986,"What? No, I want to watch this.
"
6987,"-Did your cable go out?
"
6988,"-No. No, that's VH1 .
"
6989,"I tell you, the music
"
6990,"these kids listen to today. . .
"
6991,". . .it's a lot of noise to me.
"
6992,"Why is your cable out?
"
6993,"Oh, because I haven't really
"
6994,"paid the bill.
"
6995,"If you need money,
"
6996,"would you please let me loan you some?
"
6997,"No, Chandler. Forget about it, okay?
"
6998,"I know things have been tight since
"
6999,"Janine moved out. God, was she hot.
"
7000,"I know, yeah.
"
7001,"Look, I can handle it, all right?
"
7002,"I can listen to the radio.
"
7003,"And Ross gave me this great book.
"
7004,"Want to see if the joke stealer
"
7005,"will let us watch at his place?
"
7006,"Sure.
"
7007,"-Paid your phone bill?
"
7008,"-No.
"
7009,"It's only you.
"
7010,"-What are you doing?
"
7011,"-Looking at a Playboy.
"
7012,"I want to look too!
"
7013,"Yikes!
"
7014,"Do you think these pictures
"
7015,"are trying to tell a story?
"
7016,"Sure. Like in the case
"
7017,"of this young woman. . .
"
7018,". . .she has lost her clothes.
"
7019,"So she rides naked on the horse,
"
7020,"she's crying out, ""Where are they?""
"
7021,"She's not gonna find them,
"
7022,"lying in the grass like that.
"
7023,"Remember the days when you'd
"
7024,"go out to the barn. . .
"
7025,". . .Iift up your shirt and bend over?
"
7026,"You see, now, I would date this girl.
"
7027,"She's cute, she's outdoorsy.
"
7028,"And she knows how to build a fire.
"
7029,"That'll come in handy.
"
7030,"I got a question.
"
7031,"If you had to pick one of us to date,
"
7032,"who would it be?
"
7033,"-I don't know.
"
7034,"-Me neither.
"
7035,"Rachel.
"
7036,"What?
"
7037,"I don't know.
"
7038,"Me neither.
"
7039,"You know, you forget how many
"
7040,"great songs Heart had.
"
7041,"""Barracuda"" was the first song
"
7042,"I learned to play on the keyboard.
"
7043,"So you heard it, you repeated it. . .
"
7044,". . .so that must mean you wrote it.
"
7045,"You guys with this joke.
"
7046,"Well, I gotta say. . .
"
7047,". . .I know I cracked up,
"
7048,"but I'm not even sure I got it.
"
7049,"What?
"
7050,"You didn't get it?
"
7051,"The doctor is a monkey.
"
7052,"And monkeys
"
7053,"can't write out prescriptions.
"
7054,"You are not allowed
"
7055,"to laugh at my joke.
"
7056,"Your joke?
"
7057,"Well, I think the Hef
"
7058,"would disagree.
"
7059,"Which is why he sent me a check. . .
"
7060,". . .for $1 00.
"
7061,"So you stole my joke
"
7062,"and you stole my money?
"
7063,"I was gonna stick it in the ATM.
"
7064,"But now I think I'll show
"
7065,"the sexy teller. . .
"
7066,". . .that I am a published writer.
"
7067,"She'll know that you stole the joke.
"
7068,"You gonna follow me there?
"
7069,"-Yeah.
"
7070,"-I'm not gonna go now.
"
7071,"Okay.
"
7072,"Here you go.
"
7073,"Gunther?
"
7074,"I can't pay now,
"
7075,"because I'm not working.
"
7076,"I've had to cut down
"
7077,"on some luxuries like. . .
"
7078,". . .paying for stuff, so. . . .
"
7079,"Well, if you want, you can work here.
"
7080,"I don't know.
"
7081,"It's just. . . .
"
7082,"See, I was a regular on a soap opera,
"
7083,"you know?
"
7084,"And to go from that to this,
"
7085,"it's just. . . .
"
7086,"And plus, I'd have to wait
"
7087,"on all my friends.
"
7088,"Okay. But the money's good.
"
7089,"Plus, you get to stare at Rachel
"
7090,"as much as you want.
"
7091,"What?
"
7092,"Flexible hours.
"
7093,"Maybe I could be a waiter.
"
7094,"Could I use the phone?
"
7095,"She picked Rachel.
"
7096,"She tried to back out of it, but
"
7097,"it was obvious. She picked Rachel.
"
7098,"He took my joke. He just took it.
"
7099,"This is wrong.
"
7100,"You know what else is wrong?
"
7101,"Phoebe picking Rachel.
"
7102,"Know who else picked Rachel? Ross.
"
7103,"Know what else Ross did?
"
7104,"He stole my joke.
"
7105,"I'm gonna get a joke journal,
"
7106,"you know?
"
7107,"And document the date and time
"
7108,"of every single one of my jokes.
"
7109,"Good idea. Know what's a bad idea?
"
7110,"-Picking Rachel.
"
7111,"-That's right.
"
7112,"Did you hear something?
"
7113,"Maybe it's the sound of Ross climbing
"
7114,"into my brain to steal my thoughts.
"
7115,"It's coming from the living room.
"
7116,"I finished my book.
"
7117,"-Hey, you guys.
"
7118,"-Hey.
"
7119,"Don't you guys look cute.
"
7120,"You guys make a cute couple.
"
7121,"What are you doing?
"
7122,"Just trying to re-create some of
"
7123,"the fun that we had at my place.
"
7124,"Remember? When you picked
"
7125,"Rachel over me?
"
7126,"That was funny.
"
7127,"-It was kind of funny.
"
7128,"-It wasn't funny at all!
"
7129,"Why would you do that?
"
7130,"Why didn't you pick me?
"
7131,"Fine.
"
7132,"The reason I was leaning a little
"
7133,"bit more toward Rachel than you. . .
"
7134,". . .is just, you know, you're. . .
"
7135,". . .high maintenance.
"
7136,"Let's go to lunch!
"
7137,"That is completely untrue.
"
7138,"You think I'm high maintenance?
"
7139,"Prove it.
"
7140,"You write out a list, and
"
7141,"we'll go through it point by point.
"
7142,"No, you're right, you're easygoing.
"
7143,"You're just not as easygoing
"
7144,"as Rachel. She's just more. . .
"
7145,". . .flexible and mellow. That's all.
"
7146,"Well, people are different.
"
7147,"Rachel will do whatever you want.
"
7148,"You can just walk all over her.
"
7149,"What? Are you saying that I'm
"
7150,"a pushover? I'm not a pushover.
"
7151,"Oh, okay. You're not a pushover.
"
7152,"You think I'm a pushover.
"
7153,"Well, watch this.
"
7154,"You're not invited to lunch!
"
7155,"What do you think?
"
7156,"Pretty strong, I think.
"
7157,"Come on, Monica, let's go to lunch.
"
7158,"You start working on that list.
"
7159,"-I cannot believe her.
"
7160,"-I know. Where do you want to eat?
"
7161,"-Oh, I love that Japanese place.
"
7162,"-I'm sick of Japanese. Not there.
"
7163,"Wherever you want to go is cool.
"
7164,"Oh, hey, Gunther. . .
"
7165,". . .check this out.
"
7166,"Yeah, that Chandler cracks me up.
"
7167,"You want anything to drink?
"
7168,"I'm heading up there.
"
7169,"-I'll take a coffee. Thanks.
"
7170,"-Sure.
"
7171,"-Coffee?
"
7172,"-No.
"
7173,"Coffee? I'm going up there.
"
7174,"No, thank you.
"
7175,"You need anything?
"
7176,"I'm heading up there.
"
7177,"I'd love ice water.
"
7178,"You got it.
"
7179,"What are you doing?
"
7180,"Just being friendly.
"
7181,"You're not supposed to go back there.
"
7182,"It's okay. Right?
"
7183,"Don't wink at me.
"
7184,"And put on your apron.
"
7185,"Okay.
"
7186,"I don't see you asking other
"
7187,"paying customers to put on aprons.
"
7188,"-Joey, do you work here?
"
7189,"-No.
"
7190,"-Waiter.
"
7191,"-Yeah!
"
7192,"What's going on?
"
7193,"Why didn't you tell us you work here?
"
7194,"It's kind of embarrassing. I mean,
"
7195,"I was an actor, now I'm a waiter.
"
7196,"It's supposed to go
"
7197,"the other direction.
"
7198,"So's your apron.
"
7199,"You're wearing it like a cape.
"
7200,"I mean, the job's easy
"
7201,"and the money's good, you know?
"
7202,"I guess if I'm hanging out here,
"
7203,"I might as well get paid for it.
"
7204,"I just feel kind of weird
"
7205,"serving you guys, you know?
"
7206,"It'll be great.
"
7207,"Come on, I did it and it was fine.
"
7208,"Why would it be weird?
"
7209,"Hey, Joey? Can I get some coffee?
"
7210,"It doesn't seem that weird.
"
7211,"I asked before.
"
7212,"You still haven't gotten it.
"
7213,"See, now it's weird again.
"
7214,"You're gonna make a lot of money.
"
7215,"Here's your first tip.
"
7216,"Don't eat yellow snow.
"
7217,"2: 1 5, coffeehouse.
"
7218,"This is great. Finally,
"
7219,"someone I can pass my wisdom to.
"
7220,"Let me tell you some things
"
7221,"I learned working here.
"
7222,"First, the customer is always right.
"
7223,"A smile goes a long way.
"
7224,"And if anyone is ever rude to you,
"
7225,"sneeze muffin.
"
7226,"Thanks, Rach.
"
7227,"Hey, look, you guys are just terrific,
"
7228,"you know?
"
7229,"How about clearing out
"
7230,"so I can get some new customers?
"
7231,"It's all about turnover.
"
7232,"Seriously, can I get my coffee?
"
7233,"I'm sorry. I'll get it right now.
"
7234,"And since you waited,
"
7235,"I'll toss in a free muffin.
"
7236,"Phoebe, we'd like to talk to you.
"
7237,"Okay.
"
7238,"So, maybe I am
"
7239,"a little high maintenance.
"
7240,"And maybe Rachel is
"
7241,"a little bit of a pushover.
"
7242,"But you know what you are?
"
7243,"We are sorry to tell you this,
"
7244,"but you, Phoebe, are flaky.
"
7245,"That's true, I am flaky.
"
7246,"So, what, you're just okay
"
7247,"with being flaky?
"
7248,"Yeah, totally.
"
7249,"Then I'm okay
"
7250,"with being high maintenance.
"
7251,"Yeah. And I am okay
"
7252,"with being a pushover.
"
7253,"That's great. Good for you guys.
"
7254,"-I am not high maintenance!
"
7255,"-I am not a pushover!
"
7256,"-Who said you were?
"
7257,"-You did!
"
7258,"I'm flaky. I'll say anything.
"
7259,"Hey, Gunther.
"
7260,"Can you cover for me?
"
7261,"I got an audition.
"
7262,"No, I'm leaving to get my hair dyed.
"
7263,"I like your natural color.
"
7264,"It's a great part.
"
7265,"I'm the lead guy's best friend.
"
7266,"I wait for him and save his seat.
"
7267,"Listen.
"
7268,"""I'm sorry, that seat's saved. ""
"
7269,"-That's the whole part?
"
7270,"-Maybe he's not his best friend.
"
7271,"I'll see you.
"
7272,"Oh, man.
"
7273,"I could totally get that part.
"
7274,"""I'm sorry, this seat is taken. ""
"
7275,"-Excuse me.
"
7276,"-No, I didn't mean you.
"
7277,"But you believed me?
"
7278,"I believed you were saving this seat
"
7279,"for someone.
"
7280,"So you'd hire me, right?
"
7281,"For what?
"
7282,"Exactly!
"
7283,"All right, everybody listen up!
"
7284,"The coffeehouse will be closed
"
7285,"for about an hour.
"
7286,"What?
"
7287,"It's for the kids.
"
7288,"Yeah, to keep the kids off drugs.
"
7289,"It's a very important issue
"
7290,"in this month's Playboy.
"
7291,"I'm sure you all read about it.
"
7292,"-It's my joke.
"
7293,"-It's my joke.
"
7294,"It's my joke.
"
7295,"I don't think we're gonna settle this.
"
7296,"Let's have Monica decide.
"
7297,"-Hey, Mon!
"
7298,"-Get out here!
"
7299,"-Monica?
"
7300,"-Okay.
"
7301,"You have to decide whose joke this is.
"
7302,"Why do I have to?
"
7303,"You're the only one that can be fair.
"
7304,"I can't be. You're my boyfriend.
"
7305,"But I'm your brother. We're family.
"
7306,"That's the most important thing
"
7307,"in the world.
"
7308,"Don't try to sway her.
"
7309,"I'm your only chance to have a baby.
"
7310,"-Okay, let's go.
"
7311,"-All right.
"
7312,"We'll each tell you
"
7313,"how we came up with the joke. . .
"
7314,". . .then you decide which one of us
"
7315,"is telling the truth. Me.
"
7316,"Chandler, you first.
"
7317,"I thought of the joke two months ago
"
7318,"at lunch with Steve.
"
7319,"-Did I meet him at Christmas?
"
7320,"-Can I finish?
"
7321,"You want me to pick you?
"
7322,"See, I would never
"
7323,"snap at you like that.
"
7324,"Two babies.
"
7325,"-Continue.
"
7326,"-Okay.
"
7327,"Steve said he had to go to the doctor.
"
7328,"And his doctor's name is Dr. Mompey.
"
7329,"I said, ""Dr. Monkey?"" And that is how
"
7330,"the whole Dr. Monkey thing came up.
"
7331,"Are you kidding?
"
7332,"Okay, look, I study evolution.
"
7333,"Remember? Evolution.
"
7334,"Monkey into man.
"
7335,"Plus, I'm a doctor. And. . .
"
7336,". . .I had a monkey.
"
7337,"I'm Dr. Monkey!
"
7338,"I'm not arguing with that.
"
7339,"I've heard enough for my decision.
"
7340,"-Okay, so what--?
"
7341,"-Do tell.
"
7342,"You are both idiots.
"
7343,"It's not funny.
"
7344,"And it's offensive to women.
"
7345,"And doctors. And monkeys.
"
7346,"You shouldn't argue
"
7347,"over who gets credit.
"
7348,"You should argue over who gets blamed
"
7349,"for inflicting this joke on the world.
"
7350,"Now, let it go.
"
7351,"The joke sucks.
"
7352,"-It's your joke.
"
7353,"-It is not.
"
7354,"-Oh, my God, Chandler, there you are.
"
7355,"-Hi.
"
7356,"Hey, it's Phoebe and Rachel.
"
7357,"Why don't you tell them. . .
"
7358,". . .what you told me about me
"
7359,"not being high maintenance.
"
7360,"Monica is a self-sufficient,
"
7361,"together lady.
"
7362,"Being with her
"
7363,"has been like being on a vacation.
"
7364,"And what may be perceived
"
7365,"as high maintenance. . .
"
7366,". . .is merely attention to detail. . .
"
7367,". . .and. . .
"

"
7369,"Wow. You know what? That is the best
"
7370,"fake speech I think I've ever heard.
"
7371,"Really? I've heard better.
"
7372,"Wait, he came up with that himself.
"
7373,"Tell them.
"
7374,"I'm out of words.
"
7375,"Should I say it again?
"
7376,"Look, I am not high maintenance!
"
7377,"I am not. Chandler!
"
7378,"You're a little high maintenance.
"
7379,"You are on my list!
"
7380,"Look, I'm sorry, but you're not--
"
7381,"You're not easygoing,
"
7382,"but you're passionate.
"
7383,"And that's good.
"
7384,"And when you get upset about little
"
7385,"things, I think I'm pretty good. . .
"
7386,". . .at making you feel better.
"
7387,"That's good too.
"
7388,"They say you're high maintenance. . .
"
7389,". . .but it's okay, because I like. . .
"
7390,". . .maintaining you.
"
7391,"I didn't tell him that.
"
7392,"-You're off my list.
"
7393,"-I'm off the list.
"
7394,"Phoebe?
"
7395,"It's okay that you don't want me
"
7396,"to be your girlfriend.
"
7397,"I have the best boyfriend.
"
7398,"You know,
"
7399,"suddenly I find you very attractive.
"
7400,"How'd the audition go?
"
7401,"Oh, not good. No.
"
7402,"I didn't get the part.
"
7403,"And I lost my job here, so. . . .
"
7404,"Wow, that is a bad audition.
"
7405,"Well, how did you lose your job here?
"
7406,"I had the audition. . .
"
7407,". . .but Gunther said I had to stay
"
7408,"so he could get his hair dyed.
"
7409,"So I went anyway, and he fired me.
"
7410,"He left work
"
7411,"to do a personal errand. . .
"
7412,". . .and left you in charge
"
7413,"when you've been here two days?
"
7414,"That's not right.
"
7415,"What are you gonna do?
"
7416,"You can't let him get away with that.
"
7417,"I won't let him get away with that.
"
7418,"I'm gonna say--
"
7419,"I shouldn't say anything.
"
7420,"No, I should say something!
"
7421,"Gunther?
"
7422,"I want you to give Joey his job back.
"
7423,"-It's not fair that you have to fire--
"
7424,"-Okay.
"
7425,"-What?
"
7426,"-He can have his job back.
"
7427,"That's right,
"
7428,"he can have his job back.
"
7429,"Glad we got that all straightened out.
"
7430,"There you go, Joey.
"
7431,"-Got your job back.
"
7432,"-That's great. Thanks.
"
7433,"Pretty nice, huh?
"
7434,"Now who's a pushover?
"
7435,"-Rach, you're in my seat.
"
7436,"-I'm sorry.
"
7437,"I never heard who you'd pick
"
7438,"to be your girlfriend.
"
7439,"-I'd pick you, Phoebe.
"
7440,"-Yeah, definitely you, Pheebs.
"
7441,"Yeah, I kind of thought.
"
7442,"-Never.
"
7443,"-It would totally be you.
"
7444,"If you had to pick one
"
7445,"of the other two to go out with. . .
"
7446,". . .who would you pick?
"
7447,"-No way.
"
7448,"-I'm not answering.
"
7449,"Joey.

7461,"That's on the house,

"
7463,"Great. Well, tell him thanks.
"
7464,"And since Joey seems like
"
7465,"such a nice guy. . .
"
7466,". . .maybe we could go out?
"
7467,"He's not used to women
"
7468,"being so forward. . .
"
7469,". . .but I could check with him.
"
7470,"He says it's okay.
"

"
7472,"How come our stuff isn't free?
"
7473,"It will be when you look like

"
7475,"I'm getting more dates than ever.
"
7476,"You're only giving free stuff
"

"
7478,"Joey, that is so gross!
"

"
7528,"Daddy cut me off.

"
7534,"Wow. What did he say?
"
7535,"That he wouldn't pay
"
7536,"for my lawyer.
"
7537,"Then he told me to learn

7538,"the value of money. . .
"
7539,". . .from the one daughter
"
7540,"he's actually proud of.
"
7541,"Did you hear that?

7544,"-Rach?
"
7545,"-Oh, yeah. Sorry.
"
7546,"Honey, so what did you do
"
7547,"that made dad cut you off?
"
7548,"Okay, I bought a boat.
"
7549,"You bought a boat?
"
7550,"It wasn't for me,
"
7551,"it was for a friend.
"
7552,"Boy, did we make friends
"
7553,"with the wrong sister.
"
7554,"This is the best thing that
"
7555,"could've happened to you.
"
7556,"You've needed to get out on your own.
"
7557,"When I did it, at first I
"

"
7559,"I am the only daughter

7560,"that Dad is proud of.
"
7561,"This is what you'll do.
"
7562,"You're gonna get a job.
"
7563,"You're gonna get an apartment.
"
7564,"And you can stay with us.
"
7565,"Right, Pheebs?
"
7566,"Of course, yeah.
"
7567,"Oh, that's so great!
"
7568,"Okay, I'm really gonna do this.
"
7569,"I don't know how to thank you.
"
7570,"Oh, I like cars.
"
7571,"-You all finished?
"
7572,"-Yes.
"
7573,"Great.
"
7574,"Okay, here are the tips
"
7575,"for this morning.
"
7576,"Jen gets 50, 50 for me
"
7577,"and Joey owes eight dollars.
"
7578,"-What?
"
7579,"-For all the free food you gave away.
"
7580,"If it's free, how come
"
7581,"you're charging me for it?
"
7582,"Don't give anything away
"
7583,"unless it's a birthday.
"
7584,"What if they came in third
"
7585,"in a modeling contest?
"
7586,"No.
"
7587,"Sorry.
"
7588,"I just had the hardest day.
"
7589,"Some of these are so heavy.
"
7590,"How did you pay? I thought
"
7591,"your dad took your credit card.
"
7592,"I memorized those numbers
"
7593,"when I was 1 5.
"
7594,"But look at all the cool
"
7595,"make-it-on-my-own stuff I got!
"
7596,"This is my ""Please, hire me"" sweater.
"
7597,"And these are my ""Don't you want to
"
7598,"rent me this apartment?"" pants.
"
7599,"Charging clothes to your dad doesn't
"
7600,"qualify as making it on your own.
"
7601,"Oh, Mr. Scientist has to get
"
7602,"all technical.
"
7603,"Rachel's not gonna think
"
7604,"it's a good idea.
"
7605,"-So who made her queen of the world?
"
7606,"-I would love that job!
"
7607,"What's going on?
"
7608,"Jill!
"
7609,"Did you shop?
"
7610,"No.
"
7611,"They did.
"
7612,"Yeah, we went shopping!
"
7613,"You went shopping?
"
7614,"Then you came here
"
7615,"and paraded it under Jill's nose. . .
"
7616,". . .when you know she's trying to quit.
"
7617,"That's terrible.
"
7618,"Sorry, Jill.
"
7619,"So what'd you get?
"
7620,"Oh, well, all right. Thank you.
"
7621,"I got this, you know,
"
7622,"""I want a job"" sweater.
"
7623,"And then I got. . . .
"
7624,"These are apartment pants.
"
7625,"Apartment pants?
"
7626,"You never heard of them?
"
7627,"Of course, I've heard of them.
"
7628,"Ross, what'd you get?
"
7629,"I got this. . . .
"
7630,"This.
"
7631,"-A Pashmina?
"
7632,"-Yeah!
"
7633,"I love these babies.
"
7634,"Really?
"
7635,"What's a Pashmina?
"
7636,"It's a rug.
"
7637,"Jill?
"
7638,"I'm sorry, Rachel.
"
7639,"You think that's gonna work on me?
"
7640,"I invented that.
"
7641,"Right! But I am sorry.
"
7642,"It's okay.
"
7643,"One little setback is okay.
"
7644,"But don't let it happen again, okay?
"
7645,"Okay.
"
7646,"Now, since Daddy paid for all this
"
7647,"stuff, I should take it all away.
"
7648,"But I'm just gonna take the Pashmina.
"
7649,"And the pants.
"
7650,"I'll take it all, because that way,
"
7651,"you'll learn the lesson.
"
7652,"Alrighty.
"
7653,"I'm gonna run a couple of errands
"
7654,"and I will see you at dinner.
"
7655,"She took all my stuff.
"
7656,"Yeah. Everything but
"
7657,"the little blue one.
"
7658,"That's the best one!
"
7659,"Oh, my God. Thank you so much!
"
7660,"Well, hey.
"
7661,"Oh, my gosh, that was so lame.
"
7662,"Like a Pashmina could be a rug.
"
7663,"Oh, yeah? How about you
"
7664,"with the ""I'm sorry. ""
"
7665,"Shut up! I wasn't like that at all.
"
7666,"What about what I said about
"
7667,"the apartment pants. How dumb was l?
"
7668,"-Were you this cute in high school?
"
7669,"-Oh, stop.
"
7670,"-No, you stop.
"
7671,"-No, you stop.
"
7672,"Why don't I sit here
"
7673,"and then you'll both stop it.
"
7674,"Okay, so what do you want to do?
"
7675,"Let's do something crazy.
"
7676,"I know, let's rest and drink
"
7677,"lots of fluids.
"
7678,"Okay, I'll rest.
"
7679,"But if I'm going to bed,
"
7680,"then you're coming with me.
"
7681,"See, that would be impossible to
"
7682,"resist if you weren't all. . .
"
7683,". . .drippy here.
"
7684,"Are you saying that you don't
"
7685,"want to get with this?
"
7686,"I don't think you should say that
"
7687,"even when you're healthy.
"
7688,"Come on.
"
7689,"Don't take this personally.
"
7690,"I just can't have sex
"
7691,"with a sick person.
"
7692,"I'm with you. I can't have sex with
"
7693,"a sick person either. Disgusting!
"
7694,"But I'm not sick!
"
7695,"Let me prove it to you.
"
7696,"We are two healthy people
"
7697,"in the prime of life.
"
7698,"See, that's the thing, I would like
"
7699,"to stay in the ""prime of lime. ""
"
7700,"What's up?
"
7701,"I think there's something
"
7702,"you should know.
"
7703,"It better not be about
"
7704,"the apartment pants.
"
7705,"I just pitched the idea to my boss
"
7706,"at Ralph Lauren and she loved it.
"
7707,"No. It's just, I was. . . .
"
7708,"I was with Ross and Jill
"
7709,"after you left. . .
"
7710,". . .and I'm pretty sure I saw
"
7711,"a little spark between them.
"
7712,"-What?
"
7713,"-I mean, it's probably nothing.
"
7714,"But I wanted to warn you
"
7715,"that there might be something.
"
7716,"-With Ross and Jill?
"
7717,"-Yeah.
"
7718,"With Ross and my sister?
"
7719,"With my sister Jill
"
7720,"and my ex-boyfriend Ross?
"
7721,"-Oh, there is no way.
"
7722,"-Okay, then.
"
7723,"Oh, my God! I cannot believe that!
"
7724,"I don't like it when he dates anyone,
"
7725,"but my sister?
"
7726,"Isn't that incest or something?
"
7727,"And they're gonna have sex.
"
7728,"Oh, no! What if he marries her too?
"
7729,"This is just terrible.
"
7730,"This is just terrible.
"
7731,"And I can't stop it.
"
7732,"I don't own Ross.
"
7733,"And Jill should be able to do
"
7734,"what she wants to do.
"
7735,"Oh, my God, I can't believe Ross is
"
7736,"marrying my little sister.
"
7737,"This is the worst thing that
"
7738,"could've ever happened to me.
"
7739,"But great news about
"
7740,"the apartment pants, huh?
"
7741,"That'll be $3.85.
"
7742,"What? Yesterday you said
"
7743,"I was too pretty to pay.
"
7744,"It's just, I can't,
"
7745,"because my manager said that l--
"
7746,"Happy birthday to you
"
7747,"Happy birthday to you
"
7748,"-Happy birthday, dear Annie--
"
7749,"-Amy!
"
7750,"--Amy
"
7751,"Happy birthday to you
"
7752,"That's weird,
"
7753,"today's my birthday too.
"
7754,"Not in here it isn't.
"
7755,"Sorry I'm late. What's up?
"
7756,"I just wanted to see if there were
"
7757,"any leads on the old job front.
"
7758,"No. But I walked past three sales
"
7759,"and didn't go in.
"
7760,"How strong am l?
"
7761,"That is great.
"
7762,"You know who doesn't have to
"
7763,"job-hunt? Ross.
"
7764,"-He works at the university.
"
7765,"-Yeah?
"
7766,"So you guys talked? So you get along?
"
7767,"So you're gonna go out?
"
7768,"Me go out with Ross? No.
"
7769,"God, no.
"
7770,"What would make you think that?
"
7771,"Phoebe. . .
"
7772,". . .said she thought she saw something
"
7773,"between you guys.
"
7774,"I mean, he's nice.
"
7775,"He's the kind you're friends with,
"
7776,"but not the kind you date.
"
7777,"He's the kind you date,
"
7778,"because you did. But me?
"
7779,"Not so much.
"
7780,"Oh, not so much? What do you mean?
"
7781,"ls there something wrong with Ross?
"
7782,"No, no, no. He's just. . . .
"
7783,"I don't know.
"
7784,"You know, he's just a little bookish.
"
7785,"Are you saying he's a geek?
"
7786,"You think so too?
"
7787,"No. Ross is not a geek.
"
7788,"Then let's just say
"
7789,"he's not my type.
"
7790,"Handsome is not your type?
"
7791,"Smart, kind, good kisser.
"
7792,"What, those things aren't
"
7793,"on your list?
"
7794,"Ross is great.
"
7795,"You'd be lucky to be with him.
"
7796,"If it means that much,
"
7797,"then I'll ask him out.
"
7798,"Oh, no. That's not what I meant.
"
7799,"You know what? You're right.
"
7800,"He has been really nice to me.
"
7801,"Yeah, but he's not your type.
"
7802,"But maybe that's good.
"
7803,"I'm doing all these different things.
"
7804,"Maybe I should just try
"
7805,"dating a geek too.
"
7806,"Yeah, but you don't want
"
7807,"to try too much too fast.
"
7808,"You remember what happened
"
7809,"to the little girl who. . .
"
7810,". . .tried too much too fast, don't you?
"
7811,"What?
"
7812,"She died, Jill.
"
7813,"Chandler!
"
7814,"What is it, honey?
"
7815,"You need some tea? Some soup?
"
7816,"Calling Dr. Big.
"
7817,"Dr. Big to the bed.
"
7818,"Geez, honey,
"

"
7846,"I think she's cute, but. . .

"
7850,"But after your okay,

"
7870,"Come on, I really need your help here.
"
7871,"-Fine, I'll rub it on myself.
"
7872,"-Okay.
"
7873,"So you're just kind of
"
7874,"rubbing it on yourself?
"
7875,"-Yeah.

"
7877,"You kidding me?
"
7878,"ls this turning you on?
"
7879,"Yes.
"
7880,"Is it the rubbing or the smell?
"
7881,"It's all very, very good.
"
7882,"So, you want to go. . .
"
7883,". . .mix it up?

7929,"He's taking off her coat.
"
7930,"Oh, this is just terrible.

"
7987,"So really nothing happened.

"
8035,"I cried for three days

8038,"so I was partly crying for that.
"
8039,"Well, that I can see crying

"
8041,"You didn't cry
"
8042,"when Bambi's mother died?
"
8043,"Yes, it was very sad when the guy
"
8044,"stopped drawing the deer.
"
8045,"It's okay to cry. You don't

"
8075,"No! It's not okay!

8088,"I just want to say

8090,"You're just saying that

8091,"because you're my biggest fan.
"
8092,"Take good care of that guy.
"
8093,"He's a fan.
"
8094,"Bye.
"
8095,"So you saw me

8096,"on Days of Our Lives, huh?
"
8097,"You want me to do a little
"
8098,"Doctor Drake Ramoray for you?
"
8099,"I have no idea
"
8100,"what you're talking about.
"
8101,"But I just got Phoebe Buffay's
"
8102,"autograph.
"
8103,"Oh. You're Phoebe's fan.
"
8104,"Oh, yeah. I've seen all her movies.
"
8105,"Movies?
"
8106,"That was Phoebe Buffay, the porn star.
"
8107,"I don't think so.
"
8108,"No, it was. She was in
"
8109,"Sex Toy Story Two...
"
8110,"...Lawrence of a Labia.
"
8111,"And I got her autograph.
"
8112,"The guys at the comic book store
"
8113,"won't believe this.
"
8114,"Gunther?
"
8115,"Don't let that guy in here anymore.
"
8116,"He said Phoebe's a porn star.
"
8117,"Well, I wouldn't call her a star,
"
8118,"but she's really good.
"
8119,"You should check out
"
8120,"lnspect Her Gadget.
"
8121,"-Hey.
"
8122,"-Hey.
"
8123,"Ross just totally blew me off,
"
8124,"and he didn't even tell me why.
"
8125,"Oh, well.
"
8126,"The best thing to do to get over a guy
"
8127,"is to start dating someone else.
"
8128,"Oh! There is this great guy you
"
8129,"will just love at work, named Bob.
"
8130,"He's a real up-and-comer
"
8131,"in Human Resources.
"
8132,"Thanks, but I'm not gonna date
"
8133,"some random guy from your work.
"
8134,"Not random. Bob.
"
8135,"It's probably because I'm not
"
8136,"mature enough or smart enough. . . .
"
8137,"Maybe he doesn't
"
8138,"like the way I dress.
"
8139,"No, that can't be it.
"
8140,"It's gotta be the smart thing.
"
8141,"I'm so stupid. I'm just this, like,
"
8142,"incredibly pretty, stupid girl.
"
8143,"No, honey.
"
8144,"Okay.
"
8145,"Okay. You want to know why Ross
"
8146,"canceled the date?
"
8147,"Because I asked him to.
"
8148,"You asked him to?
"
8149,"-Why?
"
8150,"-Because you are my sister. . .
"
8151,". . .and Ross and I have
"
8152,"this huge history.
"
8153,"You want to go out with Ross?
"
8154,"No.
"
8155,"You don't want him,
"
8156,"but you don't want me to?
"
8157,"You know, Bob in Human Resources. . . .
"
8158,"I can't believe you did this!
"
8159,"You had me doubting how smart I was!
"
8160,"You had me doubting my fashion sense!
"
8161,"It's not that big a deal. Just
"
8162,"don't date Ross. There's other--
"
8163,"You have no right
"
8164,"to tell me what to do.
"
8165,"I'm not telling you what to do.
"
8166,"I am telling you what not to do!
"
8167,"Why are you so jealous of me?
"
8168,"This is not about me being jealous.
"
8169,"It's about you being a brat,
"
8170,"wanting what you can't have.
"
8171,"Can't have?
"
8172,"Excuse me. The only thing
"
8173,"I can't have is dairy!
"
8174,"Well, you just blew your chances
"
8175,"at dating Bob!
"
8176,"-Who?
"
8177,"-With Human Resources!
"
8178,"Jealous of her? Who does she think
"
8179,"she is, Princess Caroline?
"
8180,"-You're jealous of Princess Caroline?
"
8181,"-Do I have my own castle?
"
8182,"Hey.
"
8183,"-Phoebe's not here, is she?
"
8184,"-No.
"
8185,"Did you get a movie?
"
8186,"Yeah. Yeah.
"
8187,"But I don't think it's the kind
"
8188,"you're gonna like.
"
8189,"Not more movies that'll have us
"
8190,"reaching for the tissues all night?
"
8191,"Sort of.
"
8192,"What's going on?
"
8193,"Phoebe's a porn star!
"
8194,"-What?
"
8195,"-Yeah!
"
8196,"What are you talking about?
"
8197,"""Phoebe Buffay in
"
8198,"Buffay The Vampire Layer. ""
"
8199,"That's Phoebe.
"
8200,"Where did you get that?
"
8201,"At the adult video place on Bleecker.
"
8202,"And I saw Joey was about to go in,
"
8203,"so I ran in ahead of him. . .
"
8204,". . .to surprise him.
"
8205,"Then I pretended that I didn't
"
8206,"know he was in there.
"
8207,"Wow. I mean,
"
8208,"I just can't believe this.
"
8209,"I mean, you think you know someone.
"
8210,"Even Phoebe, who's always been
"
8211,"somewhat of a question mark.
"
8212,"This is so bizarre.
"
8213,"I guess it makes sense.
"
8214,"She had such a terrible childhood.
"
8215,"I had a bad childhood
"
8216,"and I don't do porn.
"
8217,"Yes, but you're dead inside.
"
8218,"I'd better take that back.
"
8219,"What, why? Why?
"
8220,"We can't watch it.
"
8221,"It's Phoebe.
"
8222,"We shouldn't watch this.
"
8223,"Absolutely not. That goes back.
"
8224,"-Maybe a bit.
"
8225,"-The first half?
"
8226,"This is wrong, you guys!
"
8227,"Phoebe's our friend!
"
8228,"-I'm not gonna watch it.
"
8229,"-Yeah!
"
8230,"Good for you, Joe.
"
8231,"I thought I'd find you here,
"
8232,"Nosferatool.
"
8233,"Are you going to plunge
"
8234,"your stake into my dark places?
"
8235,"Actually, I was kind of hoping it
"
8236,"would be the other way around.
"
8237,"What's that on her ankle?
"
8238,"Her ankle is what you're watching?
"
8239,"Well, it's hard to tell.
"
8240,"God, if she would just stop moving.
"
8241,"She's just doing her job.
"
8242,"You sick bastards!
"
8243,"It's a tattoo.
"
8244,"That's weird. Phoebe doesn't--
"
8245,"Wait, that's Ursula!
"
8246,"That's not Phoebe! That is Ursula!
"
8247,"Wait, wait! I can watch that!
"
8248,"Rewind it! Rewind it!
"
8249,"Hey.
"
8250,"What's up? Oh, my God!
"
8251,"What am I doing?!
"
8252,"Hey, sweetie.

"
8254,"There's no back to this couch.
"
8255,"You hate this kind of stuff.
"
8256,"I figured I'd give it a shot.
"
8257,"One of the stories may make me cry,
"
8258,"then you won't think I'm dead inside.
"
8259,"Oh, that's so sweet.
"
8260,"I don't care if you can't cry.
"
8261,"I love you.
"
8262,"Oh, that makes me feel so warm
"
8263,"in my hollow tin chest.
"
8264,"Stop it.
"
8265,"Seriously. We get married, I'm up
"
8266,"at the altar and I'm like this:
"
8267,"I won't care.
"
8268,"I know that you'll be feeling it
"
8269,"all in here.
"
8270,"-Yeah?
"
8271,"-Yeah.

8277,"and go home. . .
"
8278,". . .and we see his empty room
"
8279,"for the first time. . .
"
8280,". . .and you got nothing?
"
8281,"It won't matter to me.
"
8282,"Okay.
"
8283,"I won't worry
"
8284,"about this anymore then.
"
8285,"And then, you know, if I die. . .
"
8286,". . .from a long illness. . .
"
8287,". . .and you're writing my eulogy. . .
"
8288,". . .and you open the desk drawer
"
8289,"and find a note from me that says:
"
8290,"""I will always be with you"" . . .
"
8291,". . .and you still can't shed
"
8292,"one tiny tear?
"
8293,"I know you'll be
"
8294,"crying a river inside.
"
8295,"-I love you.
"
8296,"-What is wrong with you?!
"
8297,"-What?
"
8298,"-What?
"
8299,"You can't shed a tear
"
8300,"for your dead wife?
"
8301,"I left you a note from the beyond!
"
8302,"-So you didn't mean any of that?
"
8303,"-No, you robot!
"
8304,"You damn kids! You ring my bell
"
8305,"one more time and I swear--
"
8306,"Oh, Jill!
"
8307,"That's a game I play
"
8308,"with the kids down the hall.
"
8309,"They've really taken a liking to me.
"
8310,"What's the matter?
"
8311,"Rachel and I had a big fight.
"
8312,"Can I come in?
"
8313,"I know we're not supposed
"
8314,"to see each other anymore.
"
8315,"I don't know anybody in this city
"
8316,"and I need somebody to talk to.
"
8317,"Sure. What happened?
"
8318,"I don't want to talk about it.
"
8319,"Okay.
"
8320,"-You know what might cheer me up?
"
8321,"-What?
"
8322,"Seeing some more of your
"
8323,"super cool slides.
"
8324,"-Wow, really?
"
8325,"-Totally. I loved them.
"
8326,"You could finish telling me about
"
8327,"the different kinds of sand.
"
8328,"I'd love to. Wait right here, I'll go
"
8329,"get the projector and my notes.
"
8330,"Thanks. You're such a good friend.
"
8331,"Have you guys seen Jill?
"
8332,"I can't find her.
"
8333,"-No.
"
8334,"-Is Ross home?
"
8335,"Maybe I'll call him and see
"
8336,"if he's seen her--
"
8337,"Who is it?
"
8338,"It's Phoebe. . .
"
8339,". . . ""Phoebe! ""
"
8340,"Hey!
"
8341,"Oh, God!
"
8342,"So you're making porn movies.
"
8343,"No, I'm not.
"
8344,"We're still rolling!
"
8345,"You're making one right now!
"
8346,"Let's go, Phoebe.
"
8347,"And you're using my name.
"
8348,"Can I help you with something?
"
8349,"Phoebe, come on!
"
8350,"Look, I'm talking right now.
"
8351,"You mean her. Oh.
"
8352,"You know, twin stuff is always
"
8353,"a real big seller.
"
8354,"What?
"
8355,"I could talk them into giving you. . .
"
8356,". . .thirty dollars.
"
8357,"No! No way! No!
"
8358,"And stop using my name!
"
8359,"And shame on you!
"
8360,"And shame on all of you!
"
8361,"You're disgusting!
"
8362,"Especially you, with that!
"
8363,"The slides are almost ready.
"
8364,"Yeah.
"
8365,"I know what this is missing:
"
8366,"Alcohol.
"
8367,"There's wine in the kitchen.
"
8368,"Oh, great.
"
8369,"What is my sister doing there,
"
8370,"and why are the drapes shut?
"
8371,"Okay. Rach, calm down, okay?
"
8372,"She's really upset.
"
8373,"We're just talking.
"
8374,"She's making something happen
"
8375,"with you to get back at me.
"
8376,"That's the only reason
"
8377,"she could be here, huh?
"
8378,"It couldn't be that maybe
"
8379,"I'm a good listener. . .
"
8380,". . .and I put on a great slide show?
"
8381,"Ross, I am telling you,
"
8382,"she is using you to get back at me.
"
8383,"I think I can take care of myself.
"
8384,"I'll talk to you later. Goodbye.
"
8385,"That was your sister, actually.
"
8386,"She thinks you're just using me.
"
8387,"So?
"
8388,"-Hey.
"
8389,"-Hey.
"
8390,"I just came from the company
"
8391,"Ursula works for.
"
8392,"Oh, no, not you too?
"
8393,"I went to get Phoebe Buffay's checks.
"
8394,"There were a lot of them.
"
8395,"Nice!
"
8396,"And I won't have to
"
8397,"go back there anymore. . .
"
8398,". . .because I gave them
"
8399,"my ""correct address. ""
"
8400,"Isn't it gonna bother you
"
8401,"that people think you're a porn star?
"
8402,"Oh, no, I know how to handle it.
"
8403,"-Good.
"
8404,"-Yeah.
"
8405,"Trying to figure out how you know me?
"
8406,"I'll give you a hint. From porn!
"
8407,"Yeah, your pervert boyfriend
"
8408,"watched me in a porno movie!
"
8409,"-See?
"
8410,"-Yeah.
"
8411,"Hey.
"
8412,"You may have been right about Jill.
"
8413,"I knew it! What happened?
"
8414,"She kissed me.
"
8415,"What? You kissed?
"
8416,"Maybe we should
"
8417,"give them some privacy. . . .
"
8418,"Look, I tried not to kiss her, okay?
"
8419,"Doesn't sound like it.
"
8420,"It's easy not to kiss someone.
"
8421,"You just don't. Look at us
"
8422,"right now, not kissing!
"
8423,"Let me finish, okay?
"
8424,"She started kissing me. . .
"
8425,". . .and I didn't stop it.
"
8426,"I guess I just wasn't thinking.
"
8427,"Yeah. Let me give you
"
8428,"something to think about.
"
8429,"Hold on! But then I started
"
8430,"thinking and I stopped the kissing.
"
8431,"Thank you for taking your tongue out
"
8432,"of my sister's mouth to tell me that.
"
8433,"I realized if anything happened
"
8434,"with me and Jill. . .
"
8435,". . .then nothing could ever
"
8436,"happen with us.
"
8437,"-What?
"
8438,"-No, I mean. . . .
"
8439,"I don't know if anything
"
8440,"is ever going to happen with us. . .
"
8441,". . .again, ever.
"
8442,"But I don't want to know
"
8443,"that it never could.
"
8444,"So I stopped it. . .
"
8445,". . .and she got mad
"
8446,"and broke my projector.
"
8447,"Wow.
"
8448,"I don't even know what to say.
"
8449,"Thank you.
"
8450,"You're welcome.
"
8451,"My God, are you crying?
"
8452,"I just don't see why those two
"
8453,"can't work things out!
"
8454,"All right, I'm leaving.
"
8455,"I'm not spending one more day with
"
8456,"someone who's out to sabotage me.
"
8457,"That's you, Rachel.
"
8458,"Yeah, I got that.
"
8459,"And you! I throw myself at you. . .
"
8460,". . .and you say no? How gay are you?
"
8461,"You take care, Jill.
"
8462,"-Okay, see you.
"
8463,"-Bye-bye.
"
8464,"I can't believe Jill's gone.
"
8465,"I can't help it, I opened a gate!

8468,"Barry and Mindy are getting a divorce.
"
8469,"What is the matter with you?
"
8470,"No. Barry and Mindy.
"
8471,"Oh, sorry. I hear ""divorce,""
"
8472,"I immediately go to Ross.
"
8473,"Who's Barry and Mindy?
"
8474,"Barry was the guy I almost married,
"
8475,"and Mindy was my best friend.
"
8476,"Wasn't he cheating on you with her?
"
8477,"That means he was falling
"
8478,"asleep on her instead of me.
"
8479,"Can you imagine if I'd married him?
"
8480,"How different would my life be?
"
8481,"I've always wondered
"
8482,"how different life would be. . .
"
8483,". . .if I'd never gotten divorced.
"
8484,"-Which time?
"
8485,"-The first time!
"
8486,"Imagine if Carol hadn't realized
"
8487,"she was a lesbian.
"
8488,"I can't.
"
8489,"I keep seeing it the good way.
"
8490,"I bet I'd still be doing my karate.
"
8491,"Towards the end of our marriage,
"
8492,"I did karate to release the tension. . .
"
8493,". . .from not doing anything
"
8494,"else physical.
"
8495,"Maybe the problem was
"
8496,"pronouncing it ka-ra-tay.
"
8497,"What if I was still fat?
"
8498,"You wouldn't be dating me,
"
8499,"that's for sure.
"
8500,"-Sure I would.

8501,"-Come on.

8506,"Hey. Hey, there's Carol again.
"
8507,"What if I had had the guts
"
8508,"to quit my job?
"
8509,"I'd probably be writing for the New

8516,"-What?
"
8517,"-Merrill Lynch?
"
8518,"A massage client who worked there

"
8523,"I thought if I worked with stocks. . .
"
8524,". . .I'd have to live in a box

8589,"-That's an idea.
"
8590,"If I hire an assistant,
"
8591,"would you take money from her?
"
8592,"No, Joey.
"
8593,"Chandler could be your assistant.
"
8594,"He could answer
"
8595,"your fan mail and stuff.
"
8596,"That would be great! Let's do that!
"
8597,"I could use the money.
"
8598,"-Welcome aboard!

8643,"-You're friends with Drake Ramoray?
"
8644,"It's hard to be Drake's friend. . .

"
8647,"Hey, or I could bring

8718,"and I'm already going crazy.
"
8719,"I miss Joan.
"
8720,"Honey, a heart attack is nature's
"
8721,"way of telling you to slow down.
"
8722,"I always thought it was nature's way
"
8723,"of telling you to die.
"
8724,"You're not gonna die.
"
8725,"I mean, you are going to die,
"
8726,"but you're not gonna die today.
"
8727,"I wish I was dead.
"
8728,"Let's take a walk.

8732,"Well, I've been doing a lot more
"
8733,"of my karate.
"
8734,"-Still a dry spell with Carol?
"
8735,"-Yeah.
"
8736,"How long has it been since
"
8737,"you've had sex?
"
8738,"-Well, last weekend. . .
"
8739,"-That's not so bad.
"
8740,". . .will be two months. . .
"
8741,". . .since I stopped trying.
"
8742,"You need to spice things up.
"
8743,"-What do you mean?
"
8744,"-I don't know.
"
8745,"You could tie her up.
"
8746,"You could eat stuff off each other.
"
8747,"Dirty talk, mï¿½nage ï¿½ trois, toys.
"
8748,"Role-playing.
"
8749,"You're warden, she's prisoner.
"
8750,"-You're the pirate, she's the wench.
"
8751,"-Okay, I think I got it.
"
8752,"You could be two stockbrokers,
"
8753,"rolling naked on the trading floor. . .
"
8754,". . .and everybody's watching.
"
8755,"It never happened.
"
8756,"And over there is Brady's Pub. . .
"
8757,". . .where I unwind
"
8758,"after a long day of ""surgeoning. ""
"
8759,"This is so amazing. What else?
"
8760,"Well, that is a large piece
"
8761,"of television equipment.
"
8762,"And that is an old man.
"
8763,"-Hey, old man!
"
8764,"-Hey.
"
8765,"Alrighty. What do you say we head
"
8766,"back to my place?
"
8767,"You know, I would really love to,
"
8768,"but I shouldn't.
"
8769,"Why?
"
8770,"Why can't the world stop turning?
"
8771,"Just for a moment. Just for us.
"
8772,"Isn't that from the show?
"
8773,"Yeah, but. . .
"
8774,". . .I may have said
"
8775,"those things before, but. . .
"
8776,". . .I never truly meant them until now.
"
8777,"That's from the show too!
"
8778,"Okay, you watch too much TV.
"
8779,"Here's the freshly
"
8780,"squeezed orange juice you asked for.
"
8781,"Thanks.
"
8782,"There's pulp in that.
"
8783,"I thought we talked about this.
"
8784,"I don't like pulp.
"
8785,"No pulp. Pulp isn't juice.
"
8786,"All juice.
"
8787,"I'm sorry.
"
8788,"I guess I just like the pulp.
"
8789,"I'm sorry.
"
8790,"I am being so rude.
"
8791,"Rachel, would you like a soda
"
8792,"or something?
"
8793,"Because Chandler will
"
8794,"run right out and get it.
"
8795,"Yeah, well, sure,
"
8796,"iced tea would be great.
"
8797,"Iced tea.
"
8798,"Okay. Anything for you, sir?
"
8799,"Did I not just tell him?
"
8800,"Okay, look, Chandler,
"
8801,"if this is gonna work. . .
"
8802,". . .you have got to listen.
"
8803,"You're gonna throw that juice at me?
"
8804,"It's not all juice.
"
8805,"Honey, this morning was fun.
"
8806,"Me hopping in on you
"
8807,"in the shower there?
"
8808,"Yeah, maybe someday we could get
"
8809,"a place with two bathrooms.
"
8810,"Look, Carol, I was thinking maybe. . .
"
8811,". . .maybe we can spice things
"
8812,"up a little.
"
8813,"-What do you mean?
"
8814,"-Carol, our sex life. It's just not--
"
8815,"-Dad!
"
8816,"-Hey there, little fella!
"
8817,"Why don't we
"
8818,"get some shoes on you?
"
8819,"Show dad how you
"
8820,"put your shoes on in your room.
"
8821,"Seriously, our sex life.
"
8822,"I was thinking maybe, I don't know. . .
"
8823,". . .we could try some new
"
8824,"things, you know, for fun.
"
8825,"-Like what?
"
8826,"-Well, I don't know.
"
8827,"What if we were to. . .
"
8828,". . .tie each other up?
"
8829,"Some people eat stuff
"
8830,"off one another.
"
8831,"Yeah.
"
8832,"You know, we could try dirty talk.
"
8833,"-We could have a threesome.
"
8834,"-I love that idea!
"
8835,"Who sold a story to ""Archie Comics""?
"
8836,"Oh, my God, that's so great.
"
8837,"You're a published writer.
"
8838,"I wish I had a present.
"
8839,"Wait a minute.
"
8840,"My last Kit Kat bar.
"
8841,"-You want to share it?
"
8842,"-Okay!
"
8843,"Chandler, I know you're mad.
"
8844,"I'm sorry.
"
8845,"I was a total jerk.
"
8846,"Completely over the line.
"
8847,"I just. . . . I hate pulp.
"
8848,"You know how Monica feels
"
8849,"about low-fat mayonnaise?
"
8850,"It's not mayonnaise!
"
8851,"Anyway, I just wanted to say
"
8852,"I'm sorry, and here.
"
8853,"-What's this?
"
8854,"-Fresh orange juice, with pulp.
"
8855,"-Just the way you like.
"
8856,"-Thanks, man.
"
8857,"Hey, Joey? Chandler sold a story
"
8858,"to ""Archie Comics. ""
"
8859,"That's great! Congratulations!
"
8860,"What's the story?
"
8861,"You wouldn't care.
"
8862,"It's just a stupid comic book story.
"
8863,"Are you kidding me?
"
8864,"I love Archie and the whole gang.
"
8865,"Well, Archie needs money
"
8866,"to fix his jalopy.
"
8867,"But he doesn't want Reggie
"
8868,"to just give him the money.
"
8869,"So Reggie hires him as his assist--
"
8870,"--as his butler.
"
8871,"And makes him do crazy things. . .
"
8872,". . .Iike bring him milk shakes
"
8873,"that can't have lumps.
"
8874,"Wait a minute.
"
8875,"That sounds a little familiar.
"
8876,"Did they already do that?
"
8877,"I think I read it!
"
8878,"Monica, listen. I have to ask.
"
8879,"Okay, Joey Tribbiani invited me back
"
8880,"to his apartment.
"
8881,"-Does he do this with a lot of girls?
"
8882,"-Yeah, a lot. A lot, a lot.
"
8883,"And I'm one of them.
"
8884,"I just cannot believe this.
"
8885,"I mean, Joey Tribbiani.
"
8886,"It's none of my business,
"
8887,"but aren't you married?
"
8888,"Yeah.
"
8889,"I wish we could just not be married
"
8890,"for a little bit.
"
8891,"You know, I just wish we could be,
"
8892,"like, on a break.
"
8893,"Well, you're not.
"
8894,"It's easy for you. You
"
8895,"can have sex with whoever you want.
"
8896,"Yeah, I can.
"
8897,"Don't think I don't. I do.
"
8898,"I mean, all the time. You bet!
"
8899,"Monica?
"
8900,"You've done it, right?
"
8901,"Of course I have. What do you think,
"
8902,"I'm like some 30-year-old virgin?
"
8903,"Oh, my God.
"
8904,"You're a 30-year-old virgin.
"
8905,"Louder. I don't think
"
8906,"the guy in the back heard.
"
8907,"Yeah, I heard it.
"
8908,"It's not like I haven't had the
"
8909,"opportunity.
"
8910,"I'm just waiting for the perfect guy.
"
8911,"I'm seeing this guy.
"
8912,"He's not perfect. . .
"
8913,". . .but I'm thinking maybe I should
"
8914,"get it over with.
"
8915,"You know, give him my flower.
"
8916,"Oh, my God, do it!
"
8917,"Honey, you've waited long enough.
"
8918,"-You know what? You are right.
"
8919,"-Sex doesn't have to be a big deal.
"
8920,"There shouldn't be all these
"
8921,"rules and restrictions.
"
8922,"People should be able to sleep
"
8923,"with whoever, whenever--
"
8924,"Rachel. I'll never think it's
"
8925,"okay to cheat on your husband.
"
8926,"What do you know, virgin?
"
8927,"Phoebe?
"
8928,"Why is smoke coming out
"
8929,"of the bathroom?
"
8930,"The doctor said that could be
"
8931,"one of the side effects.
"
8932,"Put the cigarette out.
"
8933,"No, it's not a cigarette.
"
8934,"The smoke is coming out of me!
"
8935,"-Put it out.
"
8936,"-Okay, okay!
"
8937,"-I'm so glad you're here.
"
8938,"-Come on.
"
8939,"Give it to me!
"
8940,"-I got it.
"
8941,"-Give it!
"
8942,"Hello?
"
8943,"She can't come to the phone now.
"
8944,"Right. No problem.
"
8945,"Okay, bye-bye.
"
8946,"Was it work?
"
8947,"Was it Jack? Did he yell?
"
8948,"No, just relax. Nobody yelled.
"
8949,"Jack was making sure you
"
8950,"were getting better.
"
8951,"Thank God.
"
8952,"Yeah, she's fired.
"
8953,"You've done all you can, Dr. Wesley.
"
8954,"You've got to let her go.
"
8955,"Goodbye and Godspeed, Hope Brady.
"
8956,"Not so fast, Wesley.
"
8957,"Ramoray!
"
8958,"That's right, Wesley.
"
8959,"Ijust stopped by to say that
"
8960,"you're not a real doctor.
"
8961,"And that woman 's brain is fine.
"
8962,"Oh, thank God.
"
8963,"-Hope? Hope?
"
8964,"-Drake.
"
8965,"You're not dying, Hope.
"
8966,"You're gonna live a long,
"
8967,"healthy life. With me.
"
8968,"Oh, Drake.
"
8969,"Okay.
"
8970,"Here we go.
"
8971,"Hi, Joey? It's Rachel.
"
8972,"I am free tomorrow night.
"
8973,"Yeah, sure, sure I can bring some
"
8974,"sandwiches.

9106,"I was kidding.
"
9107,"So was l.

"
9112,"Well, with Dr. Drake. . .
"
9113,". . .they always tell me what to say.
"
9114,"And with Joey, I pretty much have to
"
9115,"make it up on my own.
"
9116,"Tell me something.
"
9117,"-I just fell right off the couch there.
"
9118,"-Yeah, you did.
"
9119,"Here you go.
"
9120,"Let me ask you a question.
"
9121,"When was the last time. . .
"
9122,". . .someone told you
"
9123,"just how beautiful you are?
"
9124,"Wow.
"
9125,"I can't feel my hands.
"
9126,"Come on. Come here.
"
9127,"We can't do this.
"
9128,"Oyster?
"
9129,"If we did do this,
"
9130,"there'd be a lot of pressure on me.
"
9131,"Because you've waited a long time,
"
9132,"and I wouldn't want to disappoint you.
"
9133,"But I have nothing to compare it to.
"
9134,"Even if you were horrible,
"
9135,"how would I know?
"
9136,"I do like that.
"
9137,"It's harder for me.
"
9138,"I have four women to compete with.
"
9139,"Well, if it helps,
"
9140,"there were only three.
"
9141,"So it'd just be for tonight?
"
9142,"Absolutely. It would just be one
"
9143,"friend helping out another friend.
"
9144,"Stop it. We're not doing this.
"
9145,"-Let's do it!
"
9146,"-No!
"
9147,"Okay!
"
9148,"Do you have any moves?
"
9149,"I have some moves.
"
9150,"I have no moves.
"
9151,"Whatcha doing there?
"
9152,"-I'm sorry, this is just too weird.
"
9153,"-Yeah, forget it.
"
9154,"What if I turn out the lights?
"
9155,"That's the couch.
"
9156,"Oh, my God!
"
9157,"I know!
"
9158,"I'll tell you something.
"
9159,"We are gonna do that again!
"
9160,"Morning.
"
9161,"Oh, right.
"
9162,"Oh, God.
"
9163,"Oh, I can't believe Joey Tribbiani
"
9164,"heard me throw up.
"
9165,"He actually saw you a little bit too.
"
9166,"Oh, God, we didn't. . .?
"
9167,"Not after seeing that.
"
9168,"God, I'm just a horrible person.
"
9169,"Well, why?
"
9170,"Because I'm married.
"
9171,"That's right, I'm a married woman.
"
9172,"I came to a TV star's apartment
"
9173,"to have an affair.
"
9174,"That's ridiculous.
"
9175,"I'm not a ""star. ""
"
9176,"I'm just a regular famous actor.

9177,"And I'm a horrible, horrible person.
"
9178,"Rachel, will you stop saying that?
"
9179,"Hey, look.
"
9180,"Remember on the show
"
9181,"when Capri was dying?
"
9182,"-And she gave me--
"
9183,"-The ring from the cave.
"
9184,"Oh, my God!
"
9185,"They let you keep that stuff?
"
9186,"Sure. As long as they don't find out,
"
9187,"you can keep whatever you want.
"
9188,"And I want you to have it.
"
9189,"No, I couldn't.
"
9190,"Every time you look at it. . .
"
9191,". . .I want you to remember
"
9192,"that you are a good person.
"
9193,"Now, you had the chance to cheat. . .
"
9194,". . .and with me.
"
9195,"But you didn't.
"
9196,"And that's what this ring stands for.
"
9197,"But I thought that ring stood for
"
9198,"Capri's undying love for her brother.
"
9199,"Look, you want the ring or not?
"
9200,"Hey, look at you! You're up!
"
9201,"I thought I'd try to take a walk.
"
9202,"Will you pour me some water?
"
9203,"I'll be back soon.
"
9204,"You're not gonna call work, are you?
"
9205,"No. I've learned my lesson.
"
9206,"Let's go! Come on!
"
9207,"Move it!
"
9208,"Phoebe, come on!
"
9209,"Shoes, briefcase. Thanks, Lou.
"
9210,"Good luck with the gallbladder.
"
9211,"Hey, Joe. . .
"
9212,". . .did you ever have a threesome?
"
9213,"Look, Ross. Carol's great, and I'm sure
"
9214,"you're a very attractive man, but. . . .
"
9215,"No. The reason I'm asking is that. . .
"
9216,". . .I sort of had one last night.
"
9217,"You?
"
9218,"All right. So? Was it amazing?
"
9219,"It was. . .
"
9220,". . .okay.
"
9221,"Just okay? Did you do it right?
"
9222,"Look, it's just, did you ever
"
9223,"go to a party and think:
"
9224,"""Would anyone really miss me
"
9225,"if I weren't here?""
"
9226,"But still, Ross.
"
9227,"Your worst day with two women,
"
9228,"pretty much better than any other day.
"
9229,"It's just. . .
"
9230,". . .my part seemed to be over
"
9231,"pretty quickly. . .
"
9232,". . .and then there was
"
9233,"a lot of waiting around.
"
9234,"But you got to be with both of them.
"
9235,"Not really.
"
9236,"Just Carol.
"
9237,"-Not the other one?
"
9238,"-No, she kept kicking me away.
"
9239,"You don't want that.
"
9240,"At least you got to
"
9241,"see a lot of stuff.
"
9242,"Oh, I saw a lot of stuff.
"
9243,"-You get a little bored?
"
9244,"-A little.
"
9245,"Made a snack.
"
9246,"-What'd you have?
"
9247,"-Just a sandwich.
"
9248,"Turkey. A little mustard.
"
9249,"-Sounds good.
"
9250,"-It really was.
"
9251,"Let me tell you about this chick
"
9252,"I scored with last night.
"
9253,"Wait a minute, that was you.
"
9254,"Hey, check me out. I'm a slut!
"
9255,"So you want to do something tonight?
"
9256,"I can't.
"
9257,"Dr. Roger's coming over.
"
9258,"Oh, right.
"
9259,"Because you're still seeing him,
"
9260,"and he's a good guy.
"
9261,"I remember a time. . . .
"
9262,"Are you okay?
"
9263,"Yeah, totally.
"
9264,"Totally. Are you?
"
9265,"Great. It's so amazing.
"
9266,"Last time Dr. Roger came over,
"
9267,"I was so nervous.
"
9268,"But after being with you,
"
9269,"I'm like, ""Can the doctor see me now?""
"
9270,"I bet he can.
"
9271,"""I don't have an appointment,
"
9272,"but I sure could use a physical. ""
"
9273,"-You sure you're okay?
"
9274,"-Don't worry about me, I'll be fine.
"
9275,"My God! Barry!
"
9276,"You said you'd be away all weekend!
"
9277,"That's right! I'm sorry!
"
9278,"I am early!
"
9279,"Finish, please!
"
9280,"Surprise! Look who's back!
"
9281,"Call security.
"
9282,"Pheebs, didn't you get fired?
"
9283,"I don't think so.
"
9284,"-What are you doing here?
"
9285,"-All better. Back to work.
"
9286,"This clown from research
"
9287,"told me I was fired.
"
9288,"He should do his research, huh?
"
9289,"Well, you were fired.
"
9290,"I told that guy
"
9291,"who answered your phone.
"
9292,"I didn't get that message.
"
9293,"So this doesn't count.
"
9294,"Anyway, I'll be in my office.
"
9295,"Phoebe, you don't have an office.
"
9296,"I'll work right here.
"
9297,"This is good. Next to this plant.
"
9298,"You're in my office.
"
9299,"I've made a lot of cash for this
"
9300,"company. I am talking big bucks!
"
9301,"Pesos! Yen! Rubles!
"
9302,"You make one little mistake--
"
9303,"You lost 1 3 million dollars.
"
9304,"So now this is all about money?
"
9305,"You know, it's bad enough that. . . .
"
9306,"You have got to be kidding.
"
9307,"-Are you all right?
"
9308,"-I'm having another heart attack.
"
9309,"I'm having another heart attack!
"
9310,"Call 91 1 !
"
9311,"Dumb-ass!
"
9312,"Pheebs, how's it going?
"
9313,"They fired me, and I'm having
"
9314,"a heart attack.
"
9315,"Well, welcome back.
"
9316,"Is Joey Tribbiani here?
"
9317,"If you see him, please tell him
"
9318,"I'm looking for him. . .
"
9319,". . .and that this time
"
9320,"I am not gonna throw up!
"
9321,"Are you okay?
"
9322,"Me? I'm great!
"
9323,"I'm fine! I'm so good!
"
9324,"But you know who's not great?
"
9325,"Men!
"
9326,"You're a man, right, Ross?
"
9327,"Sit down.
"
9328,"Let me ask you something.
"
9329,"Do wedding vows mean squat
"
9330,"to you people?
"
9331,"Why is it that the second
"
9332,"we go out of town. . .
"
9333,". . .bam, there you are in bed
"
9334,"with the neighbor's dog-walker?
"
9335,"We're sorry.
"
9336,"No, seriously. Seriously. What has
"
9337,"happened to the sanctity of marriage?
"
9338,"-Didn't you spend last night at Joey's?
"
9339,"-What are you, a detective?
"
9340,"I don't know what's going on
"
9341,"with you and your husband. . .
"
9342,". . .and what is hopefully
"
9343,"an adult dog-walker.
"
9344,"Look, can I just say,
"
9345,"not all men are like that.
"
9346,"There are men who'll do anything
"
9347,"to make their marriage work.
"
9348,"Men who will stand by and watch. . .
"
9349,". . .as their wives engage in what can
"
9350,"only be described as a ""twosome"" . . .
"
9351,". . .with some woman she barely knows
"
9352,"from the gym!
"
9353,"Who are these men?
"
9354,"Just men. A guy I know.
"
9355,"Well, you might want to tell him
"
9356,"it sounds like his wife. . .
"
9357,". . .is gay.
"
9358,"She is not. . . .
"
9359,"She's gay.
"
9360,"Oh, my God.
"
9361,"She is so gay!
"
9362,"I can't believe this.
"
9363,"Good day for married people, huh?
"
9364,"I'm sorry your husband cheated on you.
"
9365,"I'm sorry your wife is gay.
"
9366,"I guess women aren't that great either.
"
9367,"Try telling my wife that.
"
9368,"Okay to come in?
"
9369,"Come in, eat, whatever you want.
"
9370,"Dr. Roger got beeped again.
"
9371,"Yeah, I know. Guess who beeped him?
"
9372,"I'm the ruptured spleen.
"
9373,"Why would you do that?
"
9374,"Because you shouldn't be with him.
"
9375,"You should be with me.
"
9376,"Really?
"
9377,"When you were talking about Roger,
"
9378,"that was killing me.
"
9379,"Things like last night
"
9380,"don't just happen.
"
9381,"At least not to me. I mean,
"
9382,"with the other two women. . .
"
9383,". . .in the morning, I couldn't wait
"
9384,"to go be with my friends.
"
9385,"But with you. . .
"
9386,". . .I was, you know,
"
9387,"already with a friend.
"
9388,"You probably don't want
"
9389,"to go out with me.
"
9390,"I make too many jokes, I've never
"
9391,"been in a serious relationship. . .
"
9392,". . .and I'm not technically a ""doctor. ""
"
9393,"There was just one woman,
"
9394,"wasn't there?
"
9395,"No, there were two.
"
9396,"Including me?
"
9397,"It only takes two heart attacks
"
9398,"To finally make you see
"
9399,"One of them won 't do it
"
9400,"But the second will set you free
"
9401,"Tell all your hate and anger
"
9402,"It's time to say goodbye
"
9403,"And that is just what I will do
"
9404,"Soon as those bastards I worked for
"
9405,"Die!

9407,"Remember when I had a monkey?
"
9408,"What was I thinking?
"
9409,"Hey, so, what's with the 20 percent
"
9410,"tip? Did I do something wrong?
"
9411,"20 percent is a pretty generous tip.
"
9412,"You know what's more generous?
"
9413,"50 percent!
"
9414,"-You know what's even more generous?
"
9415,"-I see where you're going.
"
9416,"What's up with the greed?
"
9417,"I'm sorry.
"
9418,"I have to get new headshots made,
"
9419,"and they're really expensive.
"
9420,"I'm down to, like, three.
"
9421,"Actually, two, because one of them
"
9422,"I blackened some teeth.
"
9423,"Why'd I do that?
"
9424,"Isn't there something you can do
"
9425,"to earn extra money?
"
9426,"Can't you pick up an extra shift here?
"
9427,"Or, you know, I used to beg for money.
"
9428,"It helps if you've got
"
9429,"a little of this going on.
"
9430,"Wow! I still have it.
"
9431,"Don't you have an audition today?
"
9432,"Maybe you'll get that job.
"
9433,"Wait a minute.
"
9434,"I used to get medical experiments
"
9435,"done on me.
"
9436,"Finally, an explanation.
"
9437,"I used to get paid for
"
9438,"all kinds of medical stuff.
"
9439,"Let's see. . . . Well, I don't want

9440,"to donate sperm again.
"
9441,"I really prefer doing that

9442,"at the home office.
"
9443,"Maybe they want some of my blood

9444,"or spit or something, huh?
"
9445,"-Joey?
"
9446,"-Yeah.
"
9447,"What did I tell you
"
9448,"about talking while working?
"
9449,"Do it?

"
9457,"We went to a self-defense class today.
"
9458,"Kicking a guy in the crotch all
"
9459,"morning really takes it out of you.
"
9460,"Takes it out of you?
"
9461,"Now we can kick anybody's ass.
"
9462,"After one class?
"
9463,"I don't think so.
"
9464,"You want to see me self-defend myself?
"
9465,"Pretend you're a predator.
"
9466,"Go on, I dare you!
"
9467,"Of course you can defend yourself from
"
9468,"an attack you know is coming.
"
9469,"That's not enough.
"
9470,"Look, I studied karate
"
9471,"for a long time.
"
9472,"And there's a concept you
"
9473,"should be familiar with.
"
9474,"It's what the Japanese call unagi.
"
9475,"Isn't that a kind of sushi?
"
9476,"No, it's a concept.
"
9477,"Yeah, it is.
"
9478,"It's freshwater eel.
"
9479,"Maybe it means that too.
"
9480,"I would kill for
"
9481,"a salmon skin roll right now.
"
9482,"Fine, get attacked.
"
9483,"I don't even care.
"
9484,"Come on, Ross, we're sorry.
"
9485,"Please tell us what it is.
"
9486,"Unagi is a state of total awareness.
"
9487,"Only by achieving true unagi...

9491,"to steal your bamboo sleeping mat. . .
"
9492,". . .or your kettle of fish?
"
9493,"It's one thing being prepared
"
9494,"for an attack against each other.
"
9495,"Whole other story being prepared for

9496,"an, I don't know-- A surprise!
"
9497,"You knew that was coming. . .
"
9498,". . .but that doesn't mean
"
9499,"you have unagi.
"
9500,"If we made reservations, we could have

"
9502,"-Is Monica here?
"
9503,"-No.
"
9504,"I need help. I don't know
"
9505,"what to get for Valentine's Day.
"
9506,"Valentine's Day was two weeks ago,
"
9507,"so I wouldn't get her a calendar.
"
9508,"She was working,

9509,"so we're celebrating tonight.
"
9510,"Why don't you book a day for
"
9511,"both of you at those romantic spas?
"
9512,"That's actually a good idea.
"
9513,"And, of course, crotchless panties.
"
9514,"Appealing as that sounds

9517,"We promised to make

"
9519,"-I love that.
"
9520,"-You guys!
"
9521,"You can't make crotchless panties?
"
9522,"You take scissors and cut--
"
9523,"Okay, okay, okay.
"
9524,"Making things sounds so much fun.
"
9525,"I thought so, until I papier-mï¿½chï¿½d
"
9526,"one of my eyes shut.
"
9527,"I love papier-mï¿½chï¿½!
"
9528,"What did you make?
"
9529,"I made a flar-lar-lar.

9530,"-What is that?
"
9531,"-Nothing!
"
9532,"So, what'll you do?
"
9533,"Have you made anything
"
9534,"I can take credit for?
"
9535,"I have, I have! I started making
"
9536,"little sock bunnies!
"
9537,"Oh, for crying out loud!
"
9538,"Wait a minute. That is my sock!
"
9539,"Now it's your little bunny friend.
"
9540,"Okay. . . .
"
9541,"This actually is a flar-lar-lar.
"
9542,"Can I ask about the
"
9543,"Valentine's Day gifts?
"
9544,"-Yeah.
"
9545,"-Do we have to make the entire thing?
"
9546,"Yes. Did you forget to make yours?
"
9547,"Of course not.
"
9548,"I just have to go to the place
"
9549,"where I made it and pick it up.
"
9550,"I can't wait. It'll be
"
9551,"the best Valentine's Day ever!
"
9552,"I can't believe it!

9554,"-What?

"
9579,"What the hell was that?
"
9580,"A lesson in the importance of unagi.
"
9581,"You're a freak!
"
9582,"Perhaps.
"
9583,"Now I'm curious.
"
9584,"At what point during those girlish
"
9585,"screams would you have kicked my ass?
"
9586,"All right, so we weren't prepared!
"
9587,"I'm sorry I took drastic
"
9588,"measures to make my point.
"
9589,"I just want you to be safe.
"
9590,"Danger!
"
9591,"Ah-ha!
"
9592,"Unagi!
"
9593,"2000 bucks is a lot of money.
"
9594,"I wish I had a twin.

9595,"Where could I find someone...

9596,"... who looks exactly like me?
"
9597,"Chandler.
"
9598,"I sensed it was you.
"
9599,"What?
"
9600,"Unagi.
"
9601,"I'm always aware.
"
9602,"Are you aware that unagi is an eel?
"
9603,"-What's up?
"
9604,"-What should I make for Monica?
"
9605,"Why don't you make her
"
9606,"one of your little jokes?
"
9607,"I'm going crazy.
"
9608,"Do you have anything homemade?
"
9609,"You know what?
"
9610,"She'd love this.
"
9611,"It's a replica of Apollo 8.
"
9612,"I made it in the sixth grade.
"
9613,"I could use that. I could say,
"
9614,"""Your love sends me to the moon. ""
"
9615,"Except Apollo 8 didn't
"
9616,"actually land on the moon.
"
9617,"You can write, ""Your love lets me orbit
"
9618,"the moon twice and return safely. ""
"
9619,"I can't give this to her.
"
9620,"-Why not?
"
9621,"-It says ""Captain Ross"" on the side.

9631,"-Okay, come here.
"
9632,"Okay, it's not wrapped
"
9633,"because I just finished it.

9637,"Is ""The Way You Look Tonight"" on it?
"
9638,"We'll have to listen and see.
"
9639,"Oh, I love it!
"
9640,"Thank you so much.
"
9641,"You ready to open yours?
"
9642,"It's a sock bunny.
"
9643,"Remember how I call you bunny?
"
9644,"Not really.
"
9645,"I did one time.
"
9646,"And I want to start doing it more.
"
9647,"-That's what this is about.
"
9648,"-I see.
"
9649,"Phoebe makes sock bunnies.
"
9650,"No, she doesn't.
"
9651,"What she makes, they're sock rabbits.
"
9652,"They're completely different.
"
9653,"Okay, okay.
"
9654,"I didn't make it!
"
9655,"I forgot about tonight and that we're
"
9656,"supposed to make the presents.
"
9657,"It's okay.
"
9658,"No, it's not okay.
"
9659,"You're so incredible.
"
9660,"You went through all this time
"
9661,"and effort to make this tape.
"
9662,"I'll make this up to you.
"
9663,"I will.
"
9664,"I am going to cook you
"
9665,"anything you want in here.
"
9666,"And I'm going to do anything
"
9667,"you want in there.
"
9668,"Well, I did put a lot of thought
"
9669,"into the tape.
"
9670,"You are way too young
"
9671,"to have seen that.
"
9672,"Your birthday's in a month and a half.
"
9673,"What if I forget to get you
"
9674,"a present for that too?
"
9675,"You are totally and completely
"
9676,"1 00 percent forgiven.
"
9677,"We've got to wash that.
"
9678,"Remember that jacket you loved
"
9679,"that was too expensive?
"
9680,"You have done enough.
"
9681,"I'll wake up early and get it.
"
9682,"No-- Get it in black, not brown.
"
9683,"Your cake is ready.
"
9684,"It's like that old saying,
"
9685,"""Have sex, eat some cake. ""
"
9686,"Hey, Mon. Hey, Chan.

"
9694,"Damn it, Carl! Go wait in the hall.
"
9695,"I've got to apologize
"
9696,"on behalf of Carl.
"
9697,"Who the hell is Carl?
"
9698,"Did I not mention?
"
9699,"Carl is a guy I hired to be my twin
"
9700,"for a medical research project.
"
9701,"Sometimes the good ideas are
"
9702,"right in front of you.
"
9703,"It sounds crazy, but it might work.
"
9704,"The only problem is Carl's acting. . . .
"
9705,"The only problem?
"
9706,"He's the reason I didn't get that
"
9707,"big commercial two years ago.
"
9708,"We were supposed to be brothers,
"
9709,"but he messed up.
"
9710,"Can I get a piece of that cake?
"
9711,"Pizza! We like pizza!
"
9712,"Get out!
"
9713,"-Pat Sajak?
"
9714,"-Yep.
"
9715,"-Alex Trebek?
"
9716,"-Of course.
"
9717,"-Chuck Woolery?
"
9718,"-Definitely.
"
9719,"You will not find a single game show
"
9720,"host whose ass I cannot kick.
"
9721,"-Say it!
"
9722,"-Say we are unagi!
"
9723,"It's not something you are,
"
9724,"it's something you have.
"
9725,"Say it!
"
9726,"I could easily get out of this. . .
"
9727,". . .but there's a chance
"
9728,"you could get very, very hurt!
"
9729,"Carl, we're next. Now remember,
"
9730,"what is this not gonna be?
"
9731,"-Another Minute Maid fiasco.
"
9732,"-That's right.
"
9733,"And what are you not gonna do?
"
9734,"-I'm not gonna talk because--
"
9735,"-Damn it, Carl!
"
9736,"Can I have the next one, please?
"
9737,"Thank you.
"
9738,"Joey and Tony Tribbiani.
"
9739,"That's us.

"
9753,"I will. But not tonight.
"
9754,"For dinner music, I thought we could
"
9755,"listen to that tape that you made me.
"
9756,"Oh, the mixed tape.
"
9757,"""The Way You Look Tonight"" is on here.
"
9758,"Dance with me.
"
9759,"You are just the sweetest.
"
9760,"I love the way you look every night,

"
9768,"-Great class.
"
9769,"-Thanks.
"
9770,"I was watching.
"
9771,"A couple of questions:
"
9772,"You know that last move. . .
"
9773,". . .where that woman tripped you
"
9774,"and pinned you to the floor?
"
9775,"What would you do next?
"
9776,"She'd take the keys
"
9777,"and jam them in your--
"
9778,"No, no. What would you do next?
"
9779,"-Who, me, the attacker?
"
9780,"-Yes, that's right.
"
9781,"Why?
"
9782,"I tried attacking two women.
"
9783,"Did not work.
"
9784,"What?
"
9785,"No, it's okay.
"
9786,"They're my friends.
"
9787,"In fact, I was married to one of them.
"
9788,"You attacked your ex-wife?
"
9789,"Oh, no. No, no.
"
9790,"I tried.
"
9791,"But I couldn't.
"
9792,"That's why I'm here.
"
9793,"Maybe we could attack them together!
"
9794,"That's a no.
"
9795,"I am so, so, so, so sorry.
"
9796,"And I will cook
"
9797,"anything you want in here.
"
9798,"And do anything you want in there.

"
9984,"What?
"
9985,"Do you want to get a pizza later?
"
9986,"Hi, I'm back.

"
9991,"Hi. We didn't get to the audition.
"
9992,"I'm taking her to coffee.
"
9993,"We'll do it then.
"
9994,"Now you're going on a date
"
9995,"with this girl?
"
9996,"I haven't talked to her in 1 0 years.
"
9997,"You can't just call up
"
9998,"and ask somebody for a favor.
"
9999,"There are rules, you know?
"
10000,"You gotta put in some time.
"
10001,"Right, I'm sorry.
"
10002,"-It's not like she's an ex-girlfriend.
"
10003,"-We only went out once.
"
10004,"You dated her?!
"
10005,"Not once.
"
10006,"Why don't I just go out with an ex,
"
10007,"you know, and do Joey a favor?
"
10008,"You want to do Joey a favor?
"
10009,"Maybe you go out with Joey.
"
10010,"That's great. My friend Joey's
"
10011,"in the movie business.
"
10012,"You know who I ran into from school?
"
10013,"Howie.
"
10014,"My friend's name is Joey.
"
10015,"Apparently, Howie's editing now.
"
10016,"Yeah, he calls me up and asks me
"
10017,"if he can edit my new movie.
"
10018,"Can you believe that?
"
10019,"You know, I haven't spoken to him
"
10020,"in 1 0 years. . .
"
10021,". . .and he asks me for a favor?
"
10022,"Yeah, I've always hated that Howie.
"
10023,"No ""How you doing?""
"
10024,"Man, I mean, not even
"
10025,"a cup of coffee first.
"
10026,"-The nerve, huh?
"
10027,"-Yeah.
"
10028,"Refill?
"
10029,"This is last-minute, so I want
"
10030,"to apologize for the mess.
"
10031,"Oh, who cares?
"
10032,"Oh, my God! It sure didn't look
"
10033,"this way when I lived here.
"
10034,"I know!
"
10035,"But there's only room for one, so one
"
10036,"of you will have to stay at Joey's.
"
10037,"Since the fire was kind of my fault,
"
10038,"you should get to stay here.
"
10039,"Hey, hey, now. This was no one's
"
10040,"fault. It was an accident.
"
10041,"It was my fault.
"
10042,"You should get the nice room.
"
10043,"Okay!
"
10044,"You're the first guest
"
10045,"at ""Hotel Monica. ""
"
10046,"Hotel Monica!

10050,"-You've been through so much.
"
10051,"-I have.
"
10052,"This right here is where
"
10053,"I keep the pizza.
"
10054,"And that's where the napkin is.
"
10055,"-What's that smell?
"
10056,"-I know! I don't. . .?
"
10057,"Oh, please, it was such a big class.

10059,"What? Of course I did.

10061,"Who?
"
10062,"Oh. I had trouble remembering names,
"
10063,"so I came up with nicknames.
"
10064,"The guy on the other side of you
"
10065,"was ""Smelly Von Brown Shirt. ""
"
10066,"Oh, yeah.
"
10067,"-So did you have a nickname for me?
"
10068,"-No. No.
"
10069,"Yes, you did. What was it?
"
10070,"""Cutie McPretty. ""
"
10071,"Oh, that's so sweet!
"
10072,"Listen, I gotta tell you,
"
10073,"I'm having a great time.
"
10074,"You said it might be weird,
"
10075,"the whole student/teacher thing?
"
10076,"And to be frank,
"
10077,"I thought it would be too.
"
10078,"But it's not.
"
10079,"I mean, it's not at all.
"
10080,"-Dr. Geller!
"
10081,"-Burt!
"
10082,"Did you sleep well last night?
"
10083,"-I did.
"
10084,"-Yeah?
"
10085,"Monica was so sweet.
"
10086,"She left a little mint on my pillow.

10089,"-We determined the cause of the fire.
"
10090,"-I know. It was my candle, my candle!
"
10091,"No, there was an appliance left on.
"
10092,"It looks like a curling iron.
"
10093,"-I don't use a curling iron.
"
10094,"-Someone does.
"
10095,"Don't look at me, my hair's straight.
"
10096,"Straight, straight, straight.
"
10097,"-It could've been a hair-straightener.
"
10098,"-Oh.
"
10099,"This is where I keep the pizza.
"
10100,"And--
"
10101,"Hey, where'd the napkin go?
"
10102,"I wouldn't want my best guest
"
10103,"to strain her eyes.
"
10104,"Thanks, Monica.
"
10105,"-Does that smell bother you?
"
10106,"-From Joey's?
"
10107,"I can hardly smell it over here.
"
10108,"Well, you let me know if you can.
"
10109,"I can bake a pie to cover it.
"
10110,"-I can smell it a little, bake the pie.
"
10111,"-Okay.
"
10112,"Hello?
"
10113,"One minute, please.
"
10114,"It's the fire inspector.
"
10115,"Hello? Yeah, this is Phoebe.
"
10116,"Really?
"
10117,"Yeah, so it turns out that it wasn't
"
10118,"the hair-straightener. . .
"
10119,". . .that started the fire.
"
10120,"No, no. It was the candles.
"
10121,"Yeah. It's very not good
"
10122,"leaving candles unattended.
"
10123,"In fact, one of the first things
"
10124,"they teach you in fire school is. . .
"
10125,". . .okay, well I have to go now.
"
10126,"We had such a great time.
"
10127,"She's incredible.
"
10128,"I thought the age difference might be
"
10129,"a problem, but it wasn't.
"
10130,"Elizabeth is very mature for her age.
"
10131,"A concept lost on some people.
"
10132,"It's okay to date a student?
"
10133,"Well, not really. Technically,
"
10134,"it's not against the rules.
"
10135,"But it's frowned upon, especially by
"
10136,"the professor we saw last night:
"
10137,"""Judgy Von Holier-than-thou. ""
"
10138,"You don't want to get a reputation
"
10139,"as ""Professor McNails-his-students. ""
"
10140,"-Yeah. What should I do?
"
10141,"-Well, it seems pretty clear.
"
10142,"What's more important?
"
10143,"What people think or how you feel?
"
10144,"-You gotta follow your heart.
"
10145,"-Joey, that's so sweet.
"
10146,"-Hi.
"
10147,"-Hey! So how'd it go with Dana?
"
10148,"Any reason I should leave a block
"
10149,"of time open? Say, Thursday?
"
10150,"-I couldn't do it.
"
10151,"-You couldn't do it?
"
10152,"I need more time.
"
10153,"We're going to dinner.
"
10154,"You're going out with her again?
"
10155,"-Going out with who?
"
10156,"-Dana Keystone, from college.
"
10157,"Oh, yeah. Wasn't she. . .?
"
10158,"No, that was Dana Kaplan.
"
10159,"Oh.
"
10160,"-Joey, you didn't even know her!
"
10161,"-Yeah, whatever.
"
10162,"Great story again.
"
10163,"The yarns that you weave! Woo-hoo!
"
10164,"You know, actually I should get going.
"
10165,"Oh, no, no, stay!
"
10166,"Because you should stay.
"
10167,"Wow.
"
10168,"Oh, I am really flattered.
"
10169,"But I just. . . .
"
10170,"I don't feel that way about you.
"
10171,"Oh, no, no. That's not--
"
10172,"I'm sorry, Chandler.
"
10173,"You know, you're such a sweet guy. . .
"
10174,". . .and I don't want to hurt you.
"
10175,"I wish I could do something
"
10176,"to make you feel better.
"
10177,"No-- Really?
"
10178,"Of course.
"
10179,"Well, it just hurts so bad, l. . . .
"
10180,"Oh, I'm sorry.
"
10181,"-Maybe there is one thing you can do.
"
10182,"-What? Anything. Anything.
"
10183,"Well, I mean, this is just
"
10184,"off the top of my head now.
"
10185,"But I have this friend--
"
10186,"This actor friend.
"
10187,"He would kill me if he knew
"
10188,"that I was doing this.
"
10189,"But. . .
"
10190,". . .would it be possible for him to
"
10191,"audition for your movie on Thursday?
"
10192,"Absolutely.
"
10193,"But. . .
"
10194,". . .you'd really feel better if your
"
10195,"friend could audition for my movie?
"
10196,"The heart wants what it wants. Bye.
"
10197,"Hey! How's it going?
"
10198,"Well, not much has changed
"
10199,"in the last five minutes.
"
10200,"Yes, it has. I made cookies!
"
10201,"I'm still full from your
"
10202,"homemade potato chips.
"
10203,"But you should eat them now,
"
10204,"because they're hot from the oven.
"
10205,"Okay.
"
10206,"But not in here! Can't eat them
"
10207,"in bed, remember? No crummies!
"
10208,"Oh. Okay, I'll be out in a second.
"
10209,"Okay.
"
10210,"-What are you doing?
"
10211,"-This doesn't lock, does it?
"
10212,"-Oh! Joey, I'm sorry.
"
10213,"-It's all right, don't worry about it.
"
10214,"But look!
"
10215,"That's gonna leave a stain.
"
10216,"Rach, hey, it's fine.
"
10217,"You're at Joey's.
"
10218,"-Really?
"
10219,"-Yeah, look.
"
10220,"Yeah.
"
10221,"-I've never lived like this before.
"
10222,"-I know.
"
10223,"Well, don't waste it.
"
10224,"I mean, it's still food.
"
10225,"What do you want to do now?
"
10226,"Want to get a drink?
"
10227,"I can't.
"
10228,"-Oh, you have some studying to do?
"
10229,"-No, I have some turning 21 to do.
"
10230,"You know, I remember when I was
"
10231,"in college, we used to--
"
10232,"-What are you doing?
"
10233,"-Nothing, I'm so comfortable with you.
"
10234,"Do you not want to be seen with me?
"
10235,"No, of course I do. Are they gone?
"
10236,"No, they're still here.
"
10237,"But I think I'm about to leave.
"
10238,"What? No, no, wait, wait--
"
10239,"You're right, this is stupid.
"
10240,"Who cares what people think?
"
10241,"I mean, we like each other, right?
"
10242,"There's nothing wrong with that.
"
10243,"Come on.
"
10244,"Burt. Lydia. Mel.
"
10245,"-This is Elizabeth.
"
10246,"-Hi.
"
10247,"Aren't you in my popular culture
"
10248,"class?
"
10249,"That's right, Lydia.
"
10250,"Elizabeth is a student.
"
10251,"And we're dating.
"
10252,"And you may frown upon that but. . .
"
10253,". . .we're not gonna hide it anymore.
"
10254,"You are so fired.
"
10255,"-What?
"
10256,"-They'll fire you.
"
10257,"You can't date her.
"
10258,"It's against the rules.
"
10259,"Really? It's not just frowned upon?
"
10260,"I love it at Joey's!
"
10261,"-Nice!
"
10262,"-Thanks.
"
10263,"So, you busy Thursday?
"
10264,"Oh, very funny. Remember? My
"
10265,"audition was supposed to be Thursday.
"
10266,"You got me the audition?
"
10267,"Let's hug it up!
"
10268,"Okay, okay! What are you
"
10269,"gonna do to me if you get the part?
"
10270,"-Hey.
"
10271,"-Hi.
"
10272,"Yeah, okay, I need to talk to you.
"
10273,"I know they said the hair-straightener
"
10274,"started the fire.
"
10275,"But I think I'm partly at fault.
"
10276,"You see, I didn't tell you, but. . .
"
10277,". . .I had recently refilled
"
10278,"the tissues.
"
10279,"And so, let's face it,
"
10280,"that's just kindling.
"
10281,"So I think it's fair that
"
10282,"I stay at Joey's.
"
10283,"No, no, no, this was my fault.
"
10284,"-Besides, I'm fine here.
"
10285,"-Okay.
"
10286,"-Chandler, Monica's looking for you.
"
10287,"-Really?
"
10288,"-She said something about crummies.
"
10289,"-No, no, no! I was so careful.
"
10290,"You have to switch with me.
"
10291,"Monica is driving me crazy.
"
10292,"That's right. All the ladies
"
10293,"want to stay at Joey's.
"
10294,"No, I don't want to switch.
"
10295,"Please! I can throw
"
10296,"wet paper towels here!
"
10297,"No, but at Monica's,
"
10298,"you can eat cookies over the sink.
"
10299,"I know. I'm sorry.
"
10300,"All right, fine.
"
10301,"This looks like so much fun.
"
10302,"God, what a mess.
"
10303,"Wow, it actually is in the handbook.
"
10304,"I can't date you or have
"
10305,"a hot plate in my office.
"
10306,"I can't believe we have
"
10307,"to stop seeing each other.
"
10308,"For what it's worth, I did appreciate
"
10309,"you standing up for me.
"
10310,"That felt really nice.
"
10311,"Kind of made me like you even more.
"
10312,"I know, I know. I really like
"
10313,"you too. But we can't date.
"
10314,"It's against the rules.
"
10315,"It's forbidden.
"
10316,"Wow.
"
10317,"What?
"
10318,"Just hearing you describe it
"
10319,"as ""forbidden"" . . .
"
10320,". . .it's really hot.
"
10321,"Really?
"
10322,"Yeah.
"
10323,"Well, I don't care how hot it is,
"
10324,"it's wrong.
"
10325,"-Stop it.
"
10326,"-No, no. It's wrong.
"
10327,"It's naughty.
"
10328,"It's. . .
"
10329,". . .taboo.
"
10330,"Shut the book.
"
10331,"Hey. Let's also get a hot plate.
"
10332,"Hey.
"
10333,"Hey.
"
10334,"So?
"
10335,"So. . .?
"
10336,"It's Thursday! How was the audition?
"
10337,"It's-- Monday, one day. Tuesday,
"
10338,"two day. Wednesday, what day--
"
10339,"Oh!
"
10340,"<font color=""#ffff00"" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net
"
10341,"Well, that thing's clearly in the way.
"
10342,"All right.
"
10343,"Damn fridge!
"
10344,"-Hi, Joey. How ya doin'?
"
10345,"-Great...
"
10346,"...roomie.
"
10347,"-Yeah, I guess we are roommates now.
"
10348,"-I know.
"
10349,"Now that you bring it up,
"
10350,"our fridge is broken.
"
10351,"We have to get a new one.
"
10352,"I checked around and your half is $400.
"
10353,"Thanks a lot.
"
10354,"I'm not paying for half of that.
"
10355,"I'm only staying here
"
10356,"until my apartment gets fixed.
"
10357,"Look, Rach, my parents bought this fridge
"
10358,"just after I was born. Okay?
"
10359,"Now, I have never had a problem with it.
"
10360,"Then you show up and it breaks!
"
10361,"What does that tell ya?
"
10362,"That refrigerators don't live
"
10363,"as long as people?
"
10364,"All right, you know that the ATM
"
10365,"only lets you take out $300 at a time, so...
"
10366,"...l'll take a check for the other $100.
"
10367,"You're jokin', right?
"
10368,"Of course I'm joking. I don't take checks.
"
10369,"Thank God, you're pretty.

10372,"Hi! Do you guys know any cute guys?
"
10373,"Well, of course, I do.
"
10374,"My good friend, Joey, over here.
"
10375,"I'm sorry. Thank you, Chandler.
"
10376,"There's a big charity ball this weekend
"
10377,"and Ralph Lauren bought a table...
"
10378,"...so I kind of have to go.
"
10379,"-What's the charity?
"
10380,"-I don't know.
"
10381,"Something, either trees or disease....
"
10382,"Ralph mumbles a lot.
"
10383,"-He mumbles when you're not attentive?
"
10384,"-Yeah. It's weird.
"
10385,"But the thing is, I need to find a date.
"
10386,"What type are you looking for?
"
10387,"Someone that has his own tux
"
10388,"or the ability to rent a tux.
"
10389,"So he has to be a male
"
10390,"who has at least $50.
"
10391,"So close.
"
10392,"-Hi, everybody!
"
10393,"-Hi, there.
"
10394,"-This is Elizabeth.
"
10395,"-Hi, Elizabeth.
"
10396,"I'm a student.
"
10397,"Isn't she cute? Nope.
"
10398,"This is none of my business,
"
10399,"but weren't you guys supposed to...
"
10400,"...not be seen in public together?
"
10401,"We're not together.
"
10402,"No. We're just two people who happen
"
10403,"to have run into each other here.
"
10404,"This is....
"
10405,"Oh, sly!
"
10406,"I really wanted to meet you guys,
"
10407,"but I have to run.
"
10408,"-I'll see ya later?
"
10409,"-Okay.
"
10410,"-Bye, Ross.
"
10411,"-Bye. See you.
"
10412,"-Didn't mean to run into you like that, sir.
"
10413,"-That is quite all right, ma'am.
"
10414,"Bye.
"
10415,"So, why's she leaving? ls it a school night
"
10416,"and she has a lot of homework?
"
10417,"Yes. Her molecular epidemiology paper
"
10418,"is due tomorrow.
"
10419,"Well, tell her ""good luck"" with that.
"
10420,"Anyone else? Bring 'em on.
"
10421,"-When's her birthday?
"
10422,"-I don't know, Rachel. Why?
"
10423,"Well, you know it's just been so long
"
10424,"since I've been to Chuck E. Cheese.
"
10425,"-I like Elizabeth.
"
10426,"-Well, thanks.
"
10427,"In fact, I like her so much that you tell her
"
10428,"I want my cookies early this year.
"
10429,"A box of Thin Mints and some Tagalongs.
"
10430,"Guys, give him a break.
"
10431,"Ross, seriously, how's it going with her?
"
10432,"Well, it's actually been great.
"
10433,"She's 20, so she's not looking for anything
"
10434,"too serious, which is perfect for me now.
"
10435,"Well, that is great.
"
10436,"And seriously, she seems very nice.
"
10437,"I know you guys like
"
10438,"giving me a hard time...
"
10439,"...but it means a lot to me
"
10440,"that you like her.
"
10441,"-Just knowing you guys are, like--
"
10442,"-Okay, I got a good one.
"
10443,"What is she, like 12?
"
10444,"Chandler, do you think we talk
"
10445,"about our relationship enough?
"
10446,"Yeah. Do we have any Fruit Roll Ups?
"
10447,"Okay.
"
10448,"I just thought of the perfect guy
"
10449,"for Rachel to take.
"
10450,"That's so funny
"
10451,"'cause we found someone, too.
"
10452,"That's good. I guess she'll have a choice
"
10453,"between my guy and your weirdo.
"
10454,"-Why would our guy be a weirdo?
"
10455,"-'Cause that's just your taste.
"
10456,"See, Rachel's not gonna pick
"
10457,"your stupid guy.
"
10458,"-Yeah?
"
10459,"-Yeah.
"
10460,"My guy is a lawyer
"
10461,"who does volunteer work.
"
10462,"And, he has one of these.
"
10463,"A face ass?
"
10464,"A chin dimple.
"
10465,"Well, our guy works with Chandler.
"
10466,"And he's really nice and smart
"
10467,"and he's a great dresser.
"
10468,"-Have you seen your guy's body?
"
10469,"-No. Our guy's just a floating head.
"
10470,"Well, my guy is spectacular, okay?
"
10471,"He's a massage client.
"
10472,"And one time, when he was on the table,
"
10473,"I looked at it. And I mean, all of it.
"
10474,"-You're not supposed to look.
"
10475,"-Yeah, like there are police for that.
"
10476,"What, you look? You massaged me.
"
10477,"I know.
"
10478,"All right, your guy may have a great body,
"
10479,"but our guy...
"
10480,"...is really funny.
"
10481,"Chandler funny?
"
10482,"-Our guy's a great dancer.
"
10483,"-My guy's well-read.
"
10484,"-Our guy has great hair.
"
10485,"-My guy has great teeth.
"
10486,"Our guys smells incredible.
"
10487,"Do you want our guy to be your guy?
"
10488,"Well, you don't look good, Joe.
"
10489,"Well, the fridge broke,
"
10490,"so I had to eat everything.
"
10491,"Cold cuts, ice cream, limes.
"
10492,"What was in that brown jar?
"
10493,"-That's still in there?
"
10494,"-Not anymore.
"
10495,"So, anyway, how do you want to pay me?
"
10496,"Is this a service you're providing me?
"
10497,"No, for my new fridge. For our new fridge.
"
10498,"""Our"" new fridge?
"
10499,"-I don't live here anymore.
"
10500,"-So what?
"
10501,"Look, okay, suppose we were
"
10502,"a divorced couple.
"
10503,"And I got custody of the kid. Right?
"
10504,"Now suppose the kid dies
"
10505,"and I gotta buy a new kid.
"
10506,"Okay.
"
10507,"Gimme $400!
"
10508,"Professor Geller?
"
10509,"Oh, a student I don't know.
"
10510,"I was wondering
"
10511,"if I could talk to you for a moment?
"
10512,"Yes, of course.
"
10513,"What would this be regarding?
"
10514,"Making out in your office.
"
10515,"Of course. Why don't we go inside.
"
10516,"-What?
"
10517,"-Doorknob.
"
10518,"Sorry.
"
10519,"I actually do need to talk to you.
"
10520,"Okay, what about?
"
10521,"-Spring vacation?
"
10522,"-Spring vacation?
"
10523,"Yeah, we have time off
"
10524,"and a lot of people are going on trips--
"
10525,"-Professor Geller.
"
10526,"-Yes, Professor Fiesenstinlender?
"
10527,"I'll be with you in one moment.
"
10528,"So, I will take one box of the Thin Mints.
"
10529,"You don't understand. Elizabeth was
"
10530,"about to ask me to go on a trip with her.
"
10531,"Is that taking it slow?
"
10532,"I'm not ready for this, okay?
"
10533,"-What do I tell her?
"
10534,"-Tell her the truth. You're not ready.
"
10535,"I could do that.
"
10536,"-Well, what if she gets upset?
"
10537,"-Then you distract her with a Barbie doll.
"
10538,"Or, you could just, you know, you....
"
10539,"What the hell are you doing?
"
10540,"What the hell am I doin'?
"
10541,"You just broke my fridge!
"
10542,"What? How do you know it....
"
10543,"How do you know it's even broken?
"
10544,"You think I don't know
"
10545,"what breaks my fridge?
"
10546,"Excuse me!
"
10547,"Well, what do you know?
"
10548,"Broken!
"
10549,"That'll be $400.
"
10550,"Joey, I saw you push him.
"
10551,"You pushed him?
"
10552,"Joey, I did not break this. Okay?
"
10553,"That has been broken for a while.
"
10554,"Chandler, remember I told you
"
10555,"about our fridge?
"
10556,"I still haven't gotten the check
"
10557,"for your half yet.
"
10558,"Do not give him any money!
"
10559,"I'm not talkin' to you!
"
10560,"You broke my fridge!
"
10561,"-You wanted to see me, Professor Geller?
"
10562,"-Yes. Please come in.
"
10563,"-Doorknob?
"
10564,"-Yeah. It kind of grows on you.
"
10565,"Actually, I wanted to finish
"
10566,"talking to you about spring vacation.
"
10567,"Good.
"
10568,"Look, l....
"
10569,"I've been having a great time with you.
"
10570,"And I just don't want us to move too fast
"
10571,"or put too much pressure on us.
"
10572,"So, I'm sorry, I just don't think
"
10573,"we should go away together yet.
"
10574,"It's too soon.
"
10575,"Ross, I think you misunderstood
"
10576,"what I was saying.
"
10577,"I just wanted to tell you that
"
10578,"I'm going to Florida for a couple weeks.
"
10579,"No.
"
10580,"I think you misunderstood
"
10581,"what I was saying.
"
10582,"What I meant was--
"
10583,"You are so adorable.
"
10584,"That. Let's talk about that.
"
10585,"-Hi.
"
10586,"-Hi.
"
10587,"How did it go with Elizabeth?
"
10588,"Fine. It was just a misunderstanding.
"
10589,"She didn't want me to go with her.
"
10590,"She just wanted to tell me that
"
10591,"she's going to Florida for spring vacation.
"
10592,"Wait, is she going for spring vacation
"
10593,"or spring break, wahoo?
"
10594,"What's the difference?
"
10595,"A spring vacation, you're doing nice things
"
10596,"with your grandparents.
"
10597,"Spring break, you're doing frat guys.
"
10598,"You know what?
"
10599,"Not all spring breaks are like that.
"
10600,"-What did you do on yours?
"
10601,"-I went to Egypt with my dad.
"
10602,"I can see it now.
"
10603,"""Look, Dad, it's the Sphinx, wahoo! ""
"
10604,"I think Elizabeth is a little more serious
"
10605,"than: ""Spring break, wahoo! ""
"
10606,"All right? Come on, she's taking my class.
"
10607,"-And slept with the professor.
"
10608,"-I'm gonna call her.
"
10609,"You guys, I want you to meet Sebastian.
"
10610,"We just met at the newsstand. We both
"
10611,"grabbed for the last Field and Stream.
"
10612,"What? I read that.
"
10613,"-Can I get you a cup of coffee?
"
10614,"-Yes. Thank you.
"
10615,"-Rachel, what the hell is this?
"
10616,"-What?
"
10617,"You ask us to find you a guy and then
"
10618,"you come in here with a guy of your own.
"
10619,"You found me a guy?
"
10620,"Yes, we found you a really cute
"
10621,"and funny guy from Chandler's work.
"
10622,"Yeah, and I found you one, too,
"
10623,"who is not a weirdo.
"
10624,"You know what though, guys,
"
10625,"I really appreciate that...
"
10626,"...but I'm just gonna take Sebastian
"
10627,"to the charity.
"
10628,"Are you sure?
"
10629,"Because our guy smells incredible.
"
10630,"Would you stop it with that already?
"
10631,"-Here you go.
"
10632,"-Thank you.
"
10633,"So, Sebastian,
"
10634,"do you do any volunteer work?
"
10635,"-No, not really. Why?
"
10636,"-No reason.
"
10637,"It's just I know a single guy
"
10638,"who does care about other people.
"
10639,"Are you funny?
"
10640,"-Excuse me?
"
10641,"-What are you guys doing?
"
10642,"Are you funny? Tell us a joke!
"
10643,"Look, I just wanted
"
10644,"to have coffee with Rachel.
"
10645,"Well, so do a lot of people.
"
10646,"-Actually, I gotta get going.
"
10647,"-But you--
"
10648,"-Give me a call sometime.
"
10649,"-But you didn't give me your number.
"
10650,"Okay, see you later.
"
10651,"Turns out he is kinda funny.
"
10652,"I cannot believe you guys!
"
10653,"He was really nice
"
10654,"and he just left because of you!
"
10655,"Yeah, but, ""Sebastian""?
"
10656,"What is that, a cat's name?
"
10657,"You know what I noticed, Rachel,
"
10658,"he scares easy.
"
10659,"Now, is that the kind of guy
"
10660,"you want to take to a ball?
"
10661,"""Sebastian, would you like to dance?""
"
10662,"""Okay. I gotta go.""
"
10663,"All right, guys stop it.
"
10664,"Rachel, we're very sorry.
"
10665,"That is a very insensitive thing
"
10666,"for us to do.
"
10667,"You know what? Let's make it up to you.
"
10668,"We've two great guys for you.
"
10669,"Yeah, what have you got to lose?
"
10670,"You might even end up with someone
"
10671,"really special. If you pick my guy.
"
10672,"-All right.
"
10673,"-Okay. So, you will meet our guys?
"
10674,"Yes, I'll meet 'em.
"
10675,"It doesn't matter which one you choose.
"
10676,"It's up to you.
"
10677,"Our guy is perfect.
"
10678,"Or you could go out with the guy
"
10679,"Phoebe deemed was unsuitable for herself.
"
10680,"Phoebe, there you are!
"
10681,"Okay, you broke my fridge.
"
10682,"You owe me $400.
"
10683,"-Okay, sure.
"
10684,"-Really?
"
10685,"Technically, you owe me $600
"
10686,"for sending out happy thoughts...
"
10687,"...on your last 10 auditions.
"
10688,"Call it even?
"
10689,"Okay.
"
10690,"There you are.
"
10691,"So, what did Elizabeth say?
"
10692,"Turns out she is going to Daytona
"
10693,"for ""spring break, wahoo! ""
"
10694,"That means wet T-shirt contests,
"
10695,"guys doing shots off of girls' bodies...
"
10696,"...waking up next to people
"
10697,"you don't even know.
"
10698,"She is gonna have a great time!
"
10699,"Is she staying at the Hotel Corona?
"
10700,"-You know the hotels?
"
10701,"-I was there! Spring Break '81, wahoo!
"
10702,"In 1981, you were 13.
"
10703,"So what? I drove down, sold T-shirts.
"
10704,"I had a blast.
"
10705,"You know who knows how to party?
"
10706,"Drunk college chicks.
"
10707,"Okay, she can't go.
"
10708,"You can't tell her not to go.
"
10709,"You just started dating.
"
10710,"-Then what am I supposed to do?
"
10711,"-Nothing. Just be cool with it.
"
10712,"What if she goes down there
"
10713,"and then sleeps with a bunch of guys?
"
10714,"Well, maybe you don't marry this one.
"
10715,"I'm so glad you're going on this trip.
"
10716,"Yeah, I've been working
"
10717,"so hard this semester.
"
10718,"I really need to go crazy,
"
10719,"blow off some steam.
"
10720,"Sure.
"
10721,"Look, I don't know if your plans
"
10722,"are finalized yet, but...
"
10723,"...l know another great way
"
10724,"to blow off steam.
"
10725,"-What?
"
10726,"-Are you into crafts at all?
"
10727,"Ross, are you okay?
"
10728,"Yeah. Of course I'm okay.
"
10729,"I'm just being supportive.
"
10730,"Supportive of you and this whole trip...
"
10731,"...and what's this?
"
10732,"It's a bathing suit?
"
10733,"To wear in front of people?
"
10734,"Is that supportive?
"
10735,"Is this?
"
10736,"Okay, good.
"
10737,"-Hi.
"
10738,"-Hi.
"
10739,"We're so glad you decided to meet our guy.
"
10740,"You're gonna like him so much.
"
10741,"-When do you want to meet him?
"
10742,"-I don't know.
"
10743,"-I don't work late tomorrow night.
"
10744,"-Tomorrow night is good.
"
10745,"But why put off something 'til tomorrow
"
10746,"when you can do it right now.
"
10747,"-Eldad, come here!
"
10748,"-What?
"
10749,"-Eldad, this is Rachel.
"
10750,"-How are you?
"
10751,"A little blind-sided, but, you know, good.
"
10752,"Eldad, sit down. Move over now.
"
10753,"There you go. There you are.
"
10754,"Okay, we can take a hint!
"
10755,"What? What are you doing here?
"
10756,"This is Patrick.
"
10757,"-Hi.
"
10758,"-Hi.
"
10759,"You're too late,
"
10760,"because she's already with our guy.
"
10761,"Oh, my God, you're right, I am too late.
"
10762,"They're sitting on the couch and talking.
"
10763,"Come on.
"
10764,"Rachel? This is Patrick.
"
10765,"-Hi.
"
10766,"-Hi.
"
10767,"This is the guy I was telling you about.
"
10768,"Believe me, this suit does not do justice
"
10769,"to what's underneath it.
"
10770,"Okay.
"
10771,"But Pheebs, I'm just sort of
"
10772,"in the middle of something.
"
10773,"Okay. Have a seat.
"
10774,"-You can't do that!
"
10775,"-Maybe I should go.
"
10776,"Just sit down, we're winning.
"
10777,"Okay, you know what? Maybe I should go.
"
10778,"No. Have a seat!
"
10779,"Rachel, you haven't touched Eldad's hair.
"
10780,"-It is the softest hair. Touch it.
"
10781,"-I'm good.
"
10782,"Rachel, Patrick is really rich.
"
10783,"Give her some money.
"
10784,"Phoebe, this isn't really worth
"
10785,"the free massage.
"
10786,"-That's right, Patrick. Bye-bye.
"
10787,"-No.
"
10788,"Eldad is much more cooperative
"
10789,"and he can dance.
"
10790,"You dance for Rachel.
"
10791,"No, don't dance for me, please!
"
10792,"What is the matter with you guys?
"
10793,"Yeah, okay, let's talk it out.
"
10794,"Am I the only one
"
10795,"that this is embarrassing for?
"
10796,"I'm a little embarrassed.
"
10797,"I'll tell you who should be embarrassed.
"
10798,"It's you guys. This is ridiculous!
"
10799,"Thank you, but I do not need you
"
10800,"to get me a date.
"
10801,"-Then why did she ask us to help her--
"
10802,"-I am still talking!
"
10803,"Then you chase away
"
10804,"the one guy that I actually liked.
"
10805,"No offense to you guys.
"
10806,"Really, congratulations on...
"
10807,"...all the cash.
"
10808,"And you really do have very soft hair.
"
10809,"But I'd much rather go to the ball
"
10810,"by myself than go through more of this.
"
10811,"Goodbye.
"
10812,"Now, do you use some sort
"
10813,"of special conditioner on that hair?
"
10814,"Yes, papaya extract.
"
10815,"Thank you.
"
10816,"So, have a great time down there.
"
10817,"-I will.
"
10818,"-Yeah.
"
10819,"-Did you pack that bathing suit?
"
10820,"-Yeah.
"
10821,"It was pretty funny
"
10822,"when I hid it for a while.
"
10823,"Anyway.
"
10824,"I am worried about that bathing suit.
"
10825,"Not because it's revealing,
"
10826,"which I'm fine with.
"
10827,"No, I'm concerned about your health.
"
10828,"Sun exposure.
"
10829,"Don't worry, I have plenty of sun block.
"
10830,"-It's SPF 30.
"
10831,"-All right.
"
10832,"Well, if what's in the bottle is actually 30.
"
10833,"I mean, sometimes you get 30,
"
10834,"sometimes it's 4 and I swear...
"
10835,"...more often than not, it's just milk.
"
10836,"Ross, it's gonna be okay.
"
10837,"I'm not going down there
"
10838,"to hook up with a bunch of guys.
"
10839,"I really like you.
"
10840,"I like how things are going between us.
"
10841,"-Really?
"
10842,"-Yeah.
"
10843,"I'm just going down there to relax
"
10844,"and hang out with my friends.
"
10845,"Okay. Cool.
"
10846,"Here they are!
"
10847,"Call me!
"
10848,"Rachel, we're sorry
"
10849,"for pushing those guys on you.
"
10850,"That's all right.
"
10851,"I ended up having a really good time.
"
10852,"The charity was a big success,
"
10853,"they raised a lot of money and awareness.
"
10854,"So, what was it for, anyway?
"
10855,"I wanna say a disease.
"
10856,"I just got this weird message from Ross.
"
10857,"He said to turn on MTV. I don't know.
"
10858,"Oh, my God, look! That's Elizabeth!

10859,"Professor Geller.

"
10889,"So, what's this thing
"
10890,"you're auditioning for?
"
10891,"It's a new TV show. Yeah.
"
10892,"I'm up for the part of Mac,
"
10893,"Machiavelli, or ""Mac""!
"
10894,"I'm a detective and I solve crimes

"
10899,"-So, Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.?
"
10900,"-That's the title!
"
10901,"They really lucked out
"
10902,"that the initials spell ""cheese.""
"
10903,"That is lucky.
"
10904,"So Joey, if you get this,
"
10905,"you're gonna be, like...
"
10906,"...the star of your own TV show.
"
10907,"I mean, you'll be like the ""Big Cheese""

"
10909,"Don't get your hopes up,

"
10912,"Well, I mean, come on you guys.
"
10913,"My own TV show?
"
10914,"-I don't know if I'm good enough.

10915,"-I am.
"
10916,"What are you talkin' about?
"
10917,"You're a terrific actor.
"
10918,"-You really think so?
"
10919,"-How can you even ask that question?
"
10920,"-She's pretty.
"
10921,"-Yeah. And she's really nice, too.
"
10922,"She taught me all about, you know,
"
10923,"how to work with cameras...
"
10924,"...and ""smell the fart"" acting.
"
10925,"-I'm sorry. What, Joey?

10929,"...that sometimes you need a minute
"
10930,"to remember your next one.
"
10931,"So while you're thinkin' of it, you take
"
10932,"this big pause where you look all intense.
"
10933,"You know, like this.
"
10934,"Okay.
"
10935,"Here's my scene! Here's my scene!
"
10936,"Mrs. Wallace?
"
10937,"I'm Dr. Drake Ramorey,
"
10938,"your sister's neurosurgeon.
"
10939,"You sister is suffering from a....
"
10940,"Well, Eva, we've done
"
10941,"some excellent work here.
"
10942,"And I would have to say
"
10943,"your problem is quite clear.
"
10944,"""All you want is a tinkle
"
10945,"""What you envy's a schwang
"
10946,"""A thing through which you can tinkle
"
10947,"""Or play with or simply let hang""
"
10948,"I play AI Pacino's butt.
"
10949,"All right?
"
10950,"He goes into the shower and then,
"
10951,"I'm his butt.
"
10952,"-Oh, my God.
"
10953,"-Come on, you guys.
"
10954,"This is a real movie and AI Pacino's in it,
"
10955,"and that's big!
"
10956,"No, it's terrific. You deserve this
"
10957,"after all your years of struggling...
"
10958,"...you've finally been able
"
10959,"to crack your way into show business.
"
10960,"Okay, fine, make jokes. I don't care.
"
10961,"This is a big break for me.
"
10962,"-No, you're right, it is.
"
10963,"-Yeah.
"
10964,"So, you gonna invite us all
"
10965,"to the big opening?
"
10966,"All right, I'm out of here. Wish me luck.
"
10967,"""Good luck, good luck
"
10968,"We all wish you good luck""
"
10969,"Yeah, whatever.
"
10970,"It's your turn.
"
10971,"Oh, are we playing this?
"
10972,"Hi. How did the audition go?
"
10973,"Terrible. I messed up every word.
"
10974,"I shouldn't even be an actor.
"
10975,"Wait. Are you doin' that thing
"
10976,"where you pretend it didn't go well...
"
10977,"...but it really did go well?
"
10978,"-Yeah, did I fool ya?
"
10979,"-Totally!
"
10980,"-So, it did go well?
"
10981,"-It went amazingly well!
"
10982,"-Great!
"
10983,"-That's great.
"
10984,"-It's down to me and two other guys.
"
10985,"-Oh, my God!
"
10986,"I know both of them,
"
10987,"and they're really good.
"
10988,"One's from those allergy commercials
"
10989,"who's always being chased...
"
10990,"-...by those big flowers.
"
10991,"-Oh, I love that guy!
"
10992,"What are you doing?
"
10993,"What am I doing?
"
10994,"I'm so nervous, you know?
"
10995,"The callback isn't 'til tomorrow at 5:00.
"
10996,"I feel like my head's gonna explode.
"
10997,"Well, it is overdue.
"
10998,"Don't worry, okay? You're gonna be fine.
"
10999,"Yeah, but it's so much pressure.
"
11000,"No offense, but what you guys all do
"
11001,"is very different.
"
11002,"I don't know if you'd understand.
"
11003,"Yeah, none of the rest of us
"
11004,"have to deal with pressure at our jobs.
"
11005,"Yes, I know what time it is, but I'm looking
"
11006,"at the wee-ness and I'm not happy.
"
11007,"Well, I'm tearing the lettuce.
"
11008,"-Is it dirty?
"
11009,"-No, don't worry, I'm gonna wash it.
"
11010,"Don't. I like it dirty.
"
11011,"That's your call.
"
11012,"So, what are you going to do next?
"
11013,"Well, I thought
"
11014,"that I would cut up the tomatoes.
"
11015,"Are they firm?
"
11016,"They're all right.
"
11017,"You sure they haven't gone bad?
"
11018,"You sure they're not very, very bad?
"
11019,"No, really. They're okay.
"
11020,"You gonna slice 'em up real nice?
"
11021,"Actually, I was gonna do them julienne.
"
11022,"I'm out of here.
"
11023,"Monica, I'm quitting. I just helped
"
11024,"an 81-year-old woman put on a thong...
"
11025,"...and she didn't even buy it.
"
11026,"I'm quitting. That's it.
"
11027,"I'm talking to my boss right now.
"
11028,"Yes, I am. Yes, I am.
"
11029,"Okay, bye.
"
11030,"Call me when you get this message.
"
11031,"Well, what happened?
"
11032,"Well, he came in for a massage,
"
11033,"and everything was fine until....
"
11034,"Oh, my God.
"
11035,"And all of a sudden,
"
11036,"his hands weren't the problem anymore.
"
11037,"-Was it?
"
11038,"-Boy Scouts could've camped under there.
"
11039,"You ate my sandwich.
"
11040,"It was a simple mistake.
"
11041,"It could happen to anyone.
"
11042,"Really?
"
11043,"Now calm down.
"
11044,"Come look in my office.
"
11045,"Some of it may still be in the trash.
"
11046,"-What?
"
11047,"-Well, it was quite large.
"
11048,"I had to throw most of it away.
"
11049,"You threw my sandwich away?
"
11050,"My sandwich?
"
11051,"My sandwich!
"
11052,"It's just, I want this part so much,
"
11053,"you know?
"
11054,"If I don't get this part, I'm never gonna eat
"
11055,"macaroni and cheese again.
"
11056,"No, I didn't say that. That doesn't count.
"
11057,"Come on, guys.
"
11058,"It's not like I moved to Europe.
"
11059,"I just moved across the hall.
"
11060,"And we would have you over all the time...
"
11061,"...if it weren't for Monica's allergies.
"
11062,"You're right, I could never lie to you.
"
11063,"She hates you.
"
11064,"Should I get that?
"
11065,"Hello? No, Joey's not here right now.
"
11066,"Can I take a message?
"
11067,"Yeah, okay. So the audition's been moved
"
11068,"from 5:00 to 2:30?
"
11069,"Okay, great. Bye.
"
11070,"-Aren't you dressed yet?
"
11071,"-Am I naked again?
"
11072,"We're supposed to meet my parents
"
11073,"in 15 minutes.
"
11074,"Okay. I was just talkin' to the guys.
"
11075,"Just look at 'em.
"
11076,"I mean, is it okay if they come visit?
"
11077,"What about my allergies?
"
11078,"Right. Your allergies.
"
11079,"All her. She hates you.
"
11080,"Yes! All right.
"
11081,"How cool would it be if you could watch
"
11082,"like a real life-size version of this?
"
11083,"-I mean, how crazy would that be?
"
11084,"-As crazy as soccer?
"
11085,"Hello?
"
11086,"What are you talkin' about?
"
11087,"The audition's not 'til 5:00.
"
11088,"Well, nobody told me.
"
11089,"Who'd you talk to?
"
11090,"Never mind.
"
11091,"You mean you didn't get it from this?
"
11092,"The allergy guy got the part. Thanks.
"
11093,"Maybe we can fix it, you know?
"
11094,"Maybe we can send him
"
11095,"some big, big flowers and scare him!
"
11096,"How could you do this to me?
"
11097,"This part could've turned
"
11098,"my whole career around.
"
11099,"I messed up, okay?
"
11100,"I'm sorry. I really messed up.
"
11101,"You don't even live here anymore.
"
11102,"Why'd you answer my phone?
"
11103,"-I have a machine!
"
11104,"-Which I bought for ya.
"
11105,"Taught ya how to use it.
"
11106,"You thought it was a copier.
"
11107,"If there was anything I could do,
"
11108,"I would do it, okay?
"
11109,"But everybody's allowed
"
11110,"one mistake, right?
"
11111,"He could have gotten me a VCR.
"
11112,"He could have gotten me golf clubs.
"
11113,"But no, he has to get me
"
11114,"the ""Woman Repeller.""
"
11115,"The eyesore from
"
11116,"the ""Liberace House of Crap! ""
"
11117,"-It's not that bad.
"
11118,"-Easy for you to say.
"
11119,"You don't have to sport a reject
"
11120,"from the ""Mr. T"" collection.
"
11121,"Chandler. Chandler.
"
11122,"I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry!
"
11123,"I do! I do!
"
11124,"I pity the fool that....
"
11125,"When you were late last night,
"
11126,"Kathy and I got to talking and...
"
11127,"...one thing led to another and....
"
11128,"And what? Did you sleep with her?
"
11129,"-No! No, I just kissed her.
"
11130,"-What? That's even worse!
"
11131,"-How is that worse?
"
11132,"-I don't know! But it's the same!
"
11133,"You're right, I have no excuses.
"
11134,"I was totally over the line.
"
11135,"""Over the line?""
"
11136,"You're so far past the line
"
11137,"that you can't even see the line!
"
11138,"Yeah, the line is a dot to you!
"
11139,"I'm not saying that you should
"
11140,"magically forgive me.
"
11141,"But you're not perfect.
"
11142,"You've made some errors in judgment, too.
"
11143,"Name one!
"
11144,"What happened?
"
11145,"Man! He promised
"
11146,"he wouldn't take the chairs!
"
11147,"What the hell happened?
"
11148,"How were you locked in?
"
11149,"And where the hell's all of our stuff?
"
11150,"This guy came by to look at the unit...
"
11151,"...and he said he didn't think
"
11152,"it was big enough to fit a grown man.
"
11153,"So you got in voluntarily?
"
11154,"I was tryin' to make a sale!
"
11155,"Man, if I ever run into that guy again,
"
11156,"you know what I'm gonna do?
"
11157,"Bend over?
"
11158,"There's Lori.
"
11159,"Okay, now remember, no trading.
"
11160,"You get the pretty one, I get the mess.
"
11161,"-Hi, Joey.
"
11162,"-Hey.
"
11163,"Well, well. Look what you brought.
"
11164,"And what did you bring?
"
11165,"She's checking her coat.
"
11166,"Joey, I'm gonna go wash
"
11167,"the cab smell off my hands.
"
11168,"Will you get me a white Zinfandel
"
11169,"and a glass of red for Janice.
"
11170,"Janice?
"
11171,"Oh, my God!
"
11172,"Joey's tailor took advantage of me.
"
11173,"What?
"
11174,"No way. I've been goin'
"
11175,"to the guy for 12 years.
"
11176,"You said he was gonna do my inseam...
"
11177,"...then he ran his hand up my leg
"
11178,"and then there was definite....
"
11179,"What?
"
11180,"Cupping.
"
11181,"That's how they do pants!
"
11182,"Ross, will you tell him?
"
11183,"-Isn't that how a tailor measures pants?
"
11184,"-Yes, yes, it is. In prison!
"
11185,"I said name one!
"
11186,"-I can't believe I did this. What an idiot!
"
11187,"-Stop beating yourself up.
"
11188,"People make mistakes.
"
11189,"These things happen.
"
11190,"I hope there aren't any messages
"
11191,"you've forgotten to give me, are there?
"
11192,"Apparently, you're not very good at it.
"
11193,"-Do you think he'll ever forgive me?
"
11194,"-Of course he will.
"
11195,"Chandler, the most important thing
"
11196,"is that you forgive yourself.
"
11197,"-You know what, I kind of have.
"
11198,"-Already?
"
11199,"That was pretty bad what you did.
"
11200,"You know what? He will forgive you.
"
11201,"I like to bring a pad with me when I go
"
11202,"answer the phone, just in case. Okay?
"
11203,"You didn't see how mad he was,
"
11204,"you know?
"
11205,"I'm sure he will forgive you.
"
11206,"Look, we've all been there, you know?
"
11207,"You fight, you make up.
"
11208,"That's the way it works.
"
11209,"It took two people to break up
"
11210,"this relationship!
"
11211,"Yeah! You and that girl from
"
11212,"the copy place...
"
11213,"...which yesterday you took
"
11214,"full responsibility for!
"
11215,"I didn't know what I was taking
"
11216,"responsibility for, okay?
"
11217,"I didn't finish the whole letter.
"
11218,"-What?
"
11219,"-I fell asleep.
"
11220,"You fell asleep?
"
11221,"It was 5:30 in the morning.
"
11222,"And you had rambled on for 18 pages.
"
11223,"Front and back!
"
11224,"And by the way?
"
11225,"Y-O-U, apostrophe R-E means, ""you are.""
"
11226,"Y-O-U-R means ""your.""
"
11227,"I can't believe I thought
"
11228,"of getting back together with you.
"
11229,"We are so over!
"
11230,"Fine by me!
"
11231,"And just so you know,
"
11232,"it's not that common...
"
11233,"...it doesn't happen to every guy,
"
11234,"and it is a big deal!
"
11235,"I knew it!
"
11236,"You had no right to go out with him.
"
11237,"That is the most ridiculous--
"
11238,"-You sold me out!
"
11239,"-I did not sell you out!
"
11240,"-Yes, you did! You absolutely sold me--
"
11241,"-Would you let me talk?
"
11242,"Did you just flick me?
"
11243,"Okay, well you wouldn't let me finish
"
11244,"and I was just--
"
11245,"Stop it!
"
11246,"-Stop.
"
11247,"-Stop.
"
11248,"-All right. No, let's not do this.
"
11249,"-No!
"
11250,"-Happy thoughts.
"
11251,"-No!
"
11252,"-Happy thoughts.
"
11253,"-No!
"
11254,"Okay, now I'm gonna kick some ass!
"
11255,"All right. Now, I will let go
"
11256,"if you both stop.
"
11257,"-Fine.
"
11258,"-Fine.
"
11259,"There we go.
"
11260,"You know what? lf we were in prison,
"
11261,"you guys would be, like, my bitches.
"
11262,"Okay, buddy boy, here it is.
"
11263,"You hide my clothes?
"
11264,"I'm wearin' everything you own.
"
11265,"Oh, my God!
"
11266,"Look at me, I'm Chandler!
"
11267,"Could I be wearin' any more clothes?
"
11268,"Maybe if I wasn't going ""commando"".
"
11269,"I tell ya, it's hot with all this stuff on.
"
11270,"I'd better not do any lunges.
"
11271,"""I think of all the friends I've known
"
11272,"""But when I dial the telephone

"
11279,"Joey?
"
11280,"Got you the Joey special! Two pizzas!
"
11281,"Hello? Damn it!
"
11282,"Hello?
"
11283,"No, Joey's not here right now,
"
11284,"but I can take a message. I think.
"
11285,"He's still got a chance for the part?
"
11286,"That's great news!
"
11287,"Well, no, obviously not for the actor
"
11288,"who was mauled by his dog.
"
11289,"Well, that's great.
"
11290,"I will give Joey the message. Thank you.

11291,"Yes!

"
11303,"-What message?
"
11304,"-The actor playing Mac couldn't do it.
"
11305,"-They needed to see you at 2:00.
"
11306,"-What? It's 6:00!
"
11307,"Look! I wrote it! I wrote it on the board!
"
11308,"I wrote it down,
"
11309,"then went lookin' all over for ya!
"
11310,"I went to Ross's, the coffee house....
"
11311,"I went to any place
"
11312,"that they make sandwiches!
"
11313,"-I can't believe this, Chandler!
"
11314,"-I'm sorry.
"
11315,"I don't know what to say!
"
11316,"You might say, ""Congratulations! ""
"
11317,"I saw the board, I went to the audition,
"
11318,"I got the part!
"
11319,"Was that supposed to be funny?
"
11320,"I was worried over here.
"
11321,"-I'm sorry.
"
11322,"-At times that fake-out thing is just mean.
"
11323,"Okay, man. I'm sorry.
"
11324,"I did not mean to make you feel bad.
"
11325,"Well, that's good.
"
11326,"Because ya didn't!

11327,"And I'm incredibly happy for ya!

"
11361,"My hearing would be impaired.
"
11362,"I thought you were excellent.
"
11363,"In fact, for a minute there, I was like,

11364,"""Where did Ross go?""
"
11365,"Thank you. And I have to say

11366,"that first scene where you meet Mac....
"
11367,"-Yeah?
"
11368,"-Oh, my God. I mean....
"
11369,"And you know what?
"
11370,"I think that's enough for today.
"
11371,"Thanks for your help.

"
11391,"That's right. It's your first day.
"
11392,"Are you psyched to fight fake crime

"
11394,"Am I psyched?
"
11395,"The lead in my own TV series?
"
11396,"I've dreamed about this for years!
"
11397,"Why have I not been preparing?
"
11398,"Joey, you're gonna be great.
"
11399,"But I gotta act with a robot.
"
11400,"I don't know anything about technology.
"
11401,"I can't even use Chandler's computer,
"
11402,"except to find porn.
"
11403,"And that's only because
"
11404,"it's there when you turn it on.
"
11405,"Our lover's spat will start
"
11406,"a little early this month.

11407,"I'll be waiting.

"
11410,"Are you judging them by their covers?
"
11411,"Because you're really not supposed to.
"
11412,"I'm deciding which one to use.
"
11413,"I'm going to start writing another book.
"
11414,"Because the last one was such a big seller?
"
11415,"Well, if you must know,
"
11416,"I have written 14 books.
"
11417,"And as I'm the only one
"
11418,"who has read them...
"
11419,"...l can tell you that
"
11420,"they have all been very well received.
"
11421,"What are you doing later?
"
11422,"Rachel and I have to get our hair cut.
"
11423,"-We do?
"
11424,"-I want to see what he wants first.
"
11425,"I just found out Elizabeth's dad
"
11426,"wants to meet me.
"
11427,"Wait a minute. Hold the phone.
"
11428,"You're not Elizabeth's dad?
"
11429,"Come on, guys.
"
11430,"I really want this guy to like me.
"
11431,"It would really help me out if you guys
"
11432,"could be here to make me look good.
"
11433,"-Of course we'll help.
"
11434,"-Thanks.
"
11435,"We know how tough
"
11436,"those parent-teacher conferences can be.
"
11437,"-So, here's your office set.
"
11438,"-Wow!
"
11439,"Mac Machiavelli, Private lnvestigator.

"
11441,"When do I meet the robot?
"
11442,"Why don't we do that right now?
"
11443,"He's right here.
"
11444,"Joey Tribbiani, this is--
"
11445,"Wow! He's so lifelike.
"
11446,"Unbelievable.
"
11447,"This is Wayne, the man who created
"
11448,"and operates C.H.E.E.S.E.
"
11449,"How do you do there, buddy?
"
11450,"I'll let you two guys get acquainted?
"
11451,"Sorry about that.
"
11452,"-So where's C.H.E.E.S.E.?
"
11453,"-C.H.E.E.S.E. is right here.
"
11454,"Nice to meet you, Mac.
"
11455,"-This is the temporary robot, right?
"
11456,"-No. Why?
"
11457,"Well, I just thought it was gonna be
"
11458,"a really cool robot.
"
11459,"Like the Terminator,
"
11460,"or when I first saw you.
"
11461,"I spent two years developing this machine.
"
11462,"It's absolutely state of the art.
"
11463,"Sorry. It doesn't look like
"
11464,"it can do anything.
"
11465,"It can do this.
"
11466,"This is my father, Paul Stevens.
"
11467,"Dad, this is Ross Geller.
"
11468,"It's great to meet you, Paul.
"
11469,"I prefer that Liz's boyfriends address me
"
11470,"as Mr. Stevens.
"
11471,"Of course. Mr. Stevens.
"
11472,"So, Ross...
"
11473,"...what's your problem?
"
11474,"Excuse me?
"
11475,"Why can't you get a girlfriend
"
11476,"your own age?
"
11477,"It's funny....
"
11478,"It's not funny.
"
11479,"I don't like you going out
"
11480,"with my daughter, Ross.
"
11481,"Okay, I can see that.
"
11482,"I think if you give me one chance,
"
11483,"I can change your mind.
"
11484,"-Okay.
"
11485,"-What?
"
11486,"Okay. I'll give you one chance
"
11487,"to change my mind.
"
11488,"You've got one minute.
"
11489,"-Daddy.
"
11490,"-Fine. Two minutes. Go.
"
11491,"A minute and 50 seconds.
"
11492,"I want you to know,
"
11493,"I have never done anything like this before.
"
11494,"I mean, I've been in relationships
"
11495,"in general.
"
11496,"But I've never done it with a student.
"
11497,"I mean, not....
"
11498,"Not ""it."" We haven't done ""it.""
"
11499,"I mean, we've done stuff....
"
11500,"Okay. A joke. Lighten the mood.
"
11501,"Two guys go into a bar.
"
11502,"One of them is lrish.
"
11503,"-I'm lrish.
"
11504,"-And the lrish guy wins the joke.
"
11505,"Ross! How crazy
"
11506,"that we would run into you.
"
11507,"Oh, my God! Thank you.
"
11508,"I 'd like you to meet my friends.
"
11509,"This is Phoebe, Monica, and Chandler.
"
11510,"So you're Elizabeth's father?
"
11511,"I can see now where she gets her...
"
11512,"...rugged handsomeness.
"
11513,"Is there a Mrs. Stevens?
"
11514,"There's a Mr. Bing!
"
11515,"Unfortunately, Lizzie's mom passed away
"
11516,"shortly after she was born.
"
11517,"I raised her by myself.
"
11518,"I get that a lot.
"
11519,"Why don't we all take a seat?
"
11520,"I'll get us all some coffees.
"
11521,"Yeah, why don't you....
"
11522,"And you guys can talk about
"
11523,"whatever you want.
"
11524,"Whatever pops into your head.
"
11525,"It is so strange seeing Ross here,
"
11526,"this time of day...
"
11527,"...because usually
"
11528,"he's at the children's hospital.
"
11529,"But not looking for dates.
"
11530,"Monica is Ross' sister.
"
11531,"He's a great brother!
"
11532,"I had a sister.
"
11533,"She passed away.
"
11534,"You don't have to do that every time.
"
11535,"But Ross is a great guy.
"
11536,"I was roommates with him in college.
"
11537,"Funny story....
"
11538,"Your roommate in college died, didn't he?
"
11539,"A part of him did, yes.
"
11540,"Here we are, Paul, Elizabeth.
"
11541,"I hope you guys are finding
"
11542,"something to talk about.
"
11543,"-Yes. We were just--
"
11544,"-Sorry I'm late.
"
11545,"But I am ready to talk you up.
"
11546,"When does Liz's father get here?
"
11547,"I'm already here.
"
11548,"Ross is so great!
"
11549,"Honey, you got the kind with the little girl.
"
11550,"You said we would get the kind
"
11551,"with the baby.
"
11552,"-You said the baby creeps you out.
"
11553,"-The little girl does.
"
11554,"-You said, ""the baby.""
"
11555,"-Why would the baby creep me out?
"
11556,"Why would the little girl creep you out?
"
11557,"I'm sorry.
"
11558,"Can you please talk a little slower.
"
11559,"-This is for your book?
"
11560,"-It's about relationships.
"
11561,"You know, the traps, the pitfalls,
"
11562,"what not to do.
"
11563,"Keep going. This stuff's great.
"
11564,"Excuse me.
"
11565,"And how none of it matters
"
11566,"when the people really love each other.
"
11567,"And how people will believe anything
"
11568,"you tell them as long as it's a compliment.
"
11569,"-Oh, hi!
"
11570,"-Hi.
"
11571,"-I left my keys here somewhere.
"
11572,"-Well, let's look for them.
"
11573,"Hey, look! Are these them?
"
11574,"No.
"
11575,"All right.
"
11576,"-Here they are.
"
11577,"-Good.
"
11578,"-Thanks for your help.
"
11579,"-Wait! Sorry!
"
11580,"-Mr. Paul?
"
11581,"-Just call me Paul.
"
11582,"Paul. I just wanted you to know that...
"
11583,"...Ross really is a great guy.
"
11584,"Maybe you could date him then.
"
11585,"It would save me the trouble of killing him.
"
11586,"Are you okay?
"
11587,"You just don't look old enough
"
11588,"to have a 20-year-old daughter.
"
11589,"Well, we were very young
"
11590,"when we had her.
"
11591,"We?
"
11592,"Yeah, it usually takes two people to....
"
11593,"Oh, no! Yes! Of course. I know that!
"
11594,"What I meant was are you still ""we""
"
11595,"or are you just you?
"
11596,"I'm just me.
"
11597,"My wife died shortly after Lizzie was born.
"
11598,"So you raised her all on your own?
"
11599,"Yes, I did.
"
11600,"How was your first day?
"
11601,"Pretty good. Except I got
"
11602,"a little attitude from the robot.
"
11603,"Damn those robots. They're supposed
"
11604,"to be our faithful servants!
"
11605,"It was the guy who controls the robot.
"
11606,"He doesn't like me. He had C.H.E.E.S.E.
"
11607,"knock over the sandwich table...
"
11608,"...right when I was reaching for one.
"
11609,"Why don't you get him fired?
"
11610,"I may have to. I hate to do it.
"
11611,"But I'm the star, you know?
"
11612,"There's a limit to how many sandwiches
"
11613,"I can eat off the floor.
"
11614,"Excuse me.
"
11615,"Joey Tribbiani.
"
11616,"Joe! I'm glad I found you!
"
11617,"I got an audition for you.
"
11618,"The thing is, it's kind of on the q.t.
"
11619,"The actor who has the part
"
11620,"doesn't know he might be fired.
"
11621,"It's the lead in a series.
"
11622,"Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.
"
11623,"I'm the lead in Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.
"
11624,"Joey?
"
11625,"Hi, Ross.
"
11626,"I was just getting him to like you.
"
11627,"Joey!
"
11628,"Ross, Joey is not here.
"
11629,"I'll just wait for him in here!
"
11630,"Ross, it's okay. You can come out.
"
11631,"Yeah. It's okay. It's me...
"
11632,"...Mr. Stevens.
"
11633,"I didn't.... Oh, my gosh.
"
11634,"I didn't even see you.
"
11635,"You did. You came in, got all awkward
"
11636,"and ran to the bedroom.
"
11637,"You were shouting, ""Joey! ""
"
11638,"-Bye, Rachel.
"
11639,"-Bye.
"
11640,"I'll call you later.
"
11641,"-See ya!
"
11642,"-Bye, Ross.
"
11643,"What? What the.... How did.... What?
"
11644,"You know, he lost his keys.
"
11645,"So he was looking for them.
"
11646,"In your mouth?
"
11647,"No!
"
11648,"Downstairs. And we got to talking...
"
11649,"...for two hours. I liked him.
"
11650,"I invited him for a cup of coffee.
"
11651,"You were at the coffee house!
"
11652,"What's the big deal? So I kissed the guy?
"
11653,"He's my girlfriend's father. It's weird!
"
11654,"-You dated my sister!
"
11655,"-That was different!
"
11656,"-What? Why?
"
11657,"-This is weird for me!
"
11658,"Ross, look. This is good for you.
"
11659,"Let's face it.
"
11660,"So far the guy's not loving ya.
"
11661,"But I can turn that around.
"
11662,"I've got the inside track.
"
11663,"We could all go out to dinner.
"
11664,"And I could talk you up.
"
11665,"Plus the guy is a very successful lawyer!
"
11666,"-How is that important?
"
11667,"-It's important!
"
11668,"There's a million guys
"
11669,"out there who can play Mac...
"
11670,"...and there's only one robot.
"
11671,"And this one guy who controls it.
"
11672,"I didn't know he could get me fired.
"
11673,"What am I gonna do?
"
11674,"You're a pretty charming guy.
"
11675,"Thanks. But I have a problem to deal with.
"
11676,"No, sweetie. You've got to win over
"
11677,"the guy who controls C.H.E.E.S.E.
"
11678,"Go back there
"
11679,"and kiss some serious robot ass!
"
11680,"That's not a bad idea!
"
11681,"If I have to turn on the charm tomorrow,
"
11682,"I'm not wasting any of it on you guys.
"
11683,"I got some saved for you, Pheebs.
"
11684,"Do you think Joey is
"
11685,"more charming than me?
"
11686,"Yeah. That's why I'm sleeping
"
11687,"with him on the side.
"
11688,"You wish.
"
11689,"""You wish.""
"
11690,"Stop writing about us.
"
11691,"I'm not writing about you.
"
11692,"I'm writing about other people.
"
11693,"-Who?
"
11694,"-Marsha and Chester.
"
11695,"Fine. Then you know what?
"
11696,"I will just write about Phyllis.
"
11697,"-""Phyllis is sitting in the chair.""
"
11698,"-I see what you're doing.
"
11699,"""Phyllis sees what I'm doing.""
"
11700,"I have tasted my own medicine
"
11701,"and it is bitter!
"
11702,"Morning!
"
11703,"How's my favorite genius
"
11704,"and his robot buddy?
"
11705,"-Don't touch him!
"
11706,"-Okay.
"
11707,"Level with me. I keep hearing
"
11708,"all these rumors that I might get fired.
"
11709,"They even have actors coming in
"
11710,"to read for my part.
"
11711,"Come on, man.
"
11712,"You gotta give me a second chance.
"
11713,"I love this little guy.
"
11714,"That's why you didn't want me
"
11715,"to touch him, right?
"
11716,"I can't believe this! God!
"
11717,"Hey, how are you doing?
"
11718,"So it seemed that my prom date
"
11719,"had stood me up.
"
11720,"So Ross selflessly offered to take me.
"
11721,"What a nice story.
"
11722,"So Ross was in college...
"
11723,"...and decided to jump at the chance
"
11724,"to take a young girl to her prom.
"
11725,"I definitely did not see that one backfiring.
"
11726,"-I'm going to the bathroom.
"
11727,"-Take your time.
"
11728,"I was a freshman and she was a senior.
"
11729,"So it wasn't as bad as--
"
11730,"Look. I know I've been giving you
"
11731,"a lot of jabs.
"
11732,"It's partly because
"
11733,"I'm very protective of Lizzie...
"
11734,"...and partly because
"
11735,"they just keep coming to me.
"
11736,"I have to admit that after all
"
11737,"the wonderful things Lizzie has told me...
"
11738,"...and the many stories
"
11739,"that Rachel has told me...
"
11740,"...well...
"
11741,"...you're not...
"
11742,"...all bad.
"
11743,"""Not all bad.""
"
11744,"I'm sorry I was so harsh.
"
11745,"But you have to understand.
"
11746,"I still look at Lizzie
"
11747,"like she's a 12-year-old girl.
"
11748,"I know what you mean. I do that, too.
"
11749,"-I beg your pardon?
"
11750,"-I don't see her as a 12-year-old girl.
"
11751,"I mean, I have a son who is six
"
11752,"and I still think of him as a baby.
"
11753,"You have a son?
"
11754,"My ex-wife and I share custody of Ben.
"
11755,"Just so you know,
"
11756,"Carol and I are on excellent terms...
"
11757,"...as I'm sure you are with your wife.
"
11758,"I'm sorry.
"
11759,"It's unbelievable!
"
11760,"Don't worry.
"
11761,"I just didn't realize you were married.
"
11762,"We were. But that was just a....
"
11763,"That was just a big drunken mistake.
"
11764,"You're back.
"
11765,"You two were married?
"
11766,"I'm sorry. You were talking about Emily.
"
11767,"We said we would meet
"
11768,"at the coffee house at 6:00.
"
11769,"We said 7:00.
"
11770,"We said 6:00!
"
11771,"The only way that I said 6:00...
"
11772,"...would be if I said the sentence,
"
11773,"""Let's meet at 7:00, not at 6:00.""
"
11774,"If I had said 7:00, I would have said:
"
11775,"""My boyfriend is such a wiseass. 7:00! ""
"
11776,"-Hi!
"
11777,"-Oh, my good God!
"
11778,"-I know what time you said.
"
11779,"-What?
"
11780,"Well, actually I know what time
"
11781,"Chester and Marsha said.
"
11782,"What time?
"
11783,"What an interesting turn of events.
"
11784,"Suddenly it's my book to the rescue.
"
11785,"Let's see.
"
11786,"Very interesting.
"
11787,"Well this certainly clears things up.
"
11788,"What does it say?
"
11789,"I will tell you as soon as you thank me
"
11790,"for writing my book.
"
11791,"Thank you for writing your book.
"
11792,"It's a great book...
"
11793,"...and you are the queen of everything.
"
11794,"Thanks. So are you.
"
11795,"I told you I should not wear this color.
"
11796,"""Monica, Marsha and Chester are planning
"
11797,"on seeing a movie Sunday night.
"
11798,"""Marsha thinks they're meeting at 6:00.
"
11799,"Chester thinks it's 7:00.""
"
11800,"-You knew we were gonna miss the movie?
"
11801,"-That's right.
"
11802,"Instead of telling us, you decided
"
11803,"to write it in your stupid book?
"
11804,"""Marsha and Chester are mad at Phyllis.""
"
11805,"I can't believe I'm gonna lose this job.
"
11806,"I'm so sorry, man.
"
11807,"Is there anything I can do?
"
11808,"Help me get this mini-fridge
"
11809,"past the security guard.
"
11810,"Joey, I want to talk to you.
"
11811,"Yeah? I don't want to talk to you, Wayne.
"
11812,"I hate you. You ruined my life.
"
11813,"-Chandler, Wayne. Wayne, Chandler.
"
11814,"-Hi. How are you?
"
11815,"Joey, I'll get you your job back
"
11816,"if you help me out.
"
11817,"Why should I help you out?
"
11818,"-The reason he just said.
"
11819,"-What do you need?
"
11820,"I saw you on stage talking
"
11821,"to that beautiful woman.
"
11822,"You know, Sarah.
"
11823,"I wish I could talk to her.
"
11824,"-Are you in love with her?
"
11825,"-Yeah.
"
11826,"Her. All of them. Anyone.
"
11827,"Yeah. I've been there, my friend.
"
11828,"Listen, I guarantee you keep your job...
"
11829,"...if you can teach me how to talk
"
11830,"to women like you do.
"
11831,"It's not something you can teach.
"
11832,"It's something you're born with.
"
11833,"You can teach it.
"
11834,"I can show you right now.
"
11835,"Well, if you think about it...
"
11836,"...Ross did learn something
"
11837,"from each marriage.
"
11838,"How to make the next one even shorter?
"
11839,"Wait a minute. That's not fair.
"
11840,"He was married to me a hell of a lot longer
"
11841,"than he was to Emily.
"
11842,"He just didn't tell me.
"
11843,"Maybe I have to pee again.
"
11844,"Well, this is fun.
"
11845,"So Ross, did you kill any of these wives?
"
11846,"I have had enough of this!
"
11847,"I care a great deal about your daughter.
"
11848,"And I have treated her
"
11849,"with nothing but respect!
"
11850,"So if you've got a problem with me--
"
11851,"Are you yelling at me?
"
11852,"God, no.
"
11853,"You know what, Daddy?
"
11854,"lf you don't like Ross, that's fine.
"
11855,"It doesn't matter to me.
"
11856,"I'm going to go out with him anyway.
"
11857,"Really?
"
11858,"Well, if it doesn't matter to her...
"
11859,"...it doesn't matter to me. Still not yelling.
"
11860,"What can I say?
"
11861,"This doesn't make me like you more.
"
11862,"That's okay. I'm not so crazy
"
11863,"about myself right now either.
"
11864,"-Then we agree?
"
11865,"-I guess so.
"
11866,"-Neither of us like Ross.
"
11867,"-I like Ross.
"
11868,"Kids!
"
11869,"Wait. I just thought of another story
"
11870,"about how nice Ross is.
"
11871,"That's okay, Rach.
"
11872,"We're not liking Ross right now.
"
11873,"Well, I got a lot of those, too.
"
11874,"It turns out you were right, C.H.E.E.S.E.
"
11875,"-That shipment never made it to Omaha?
"
11876,"-You got it.
"
11877,"And the rabbi's beard?
"
11878,"100 percent horse hair.
"
11879,"Nice catch, C.H.E.E.S.E.
"
11880,"It's your line, C.H.E.E.S.E.
"
11881,"Wayne! Wayne!
"
11882,"<font color=""#ffff00"" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net
"
11883,"Hi, you guys.
"
11884,"What's the matter?
"
11885,"Well, it's just one
"
11886,"of these situations that I just hate.
"
11887,"You know,
"
11888,"a massage client gave me three tickets...
"
11889,"...to the Helmut Peltz Exhibit
"
11890,"at the Morgan Chase Museum.
"
11891,"Now you're thinking
"
11892,"you gotta sleep with him.
"
11893,"No, it's just that he gave me three tickets
"
11894,"and there are six of us.
"
11895,"-I'll give up my ticket.
"
11896,"-Me, too.
"
11897,"Okay. That's so generous.
"
11898,"And I think Ross is generous, too.
"
11899,"Great! Okay. Then it's just us girls.
"
11900,"-Great.
"
11901,"-Yeah.
"
11902,"So what is the exhibit?
"
11903,"It's mostly just photographs of...
"
11904,"...lesbian love scenes interspersed
"
11905,"with video games and free sandwiches.
"
11906,"Oh, man!
"
11907,"-Hi.
"
11908,"-Hi.
"
11909,"Hey, Ross. Listen.
"
11910,"Chandler got you out of going to the
"
11911,"lesbian sandwich museum this weekend.
"
11912,"Thanks? But I have plans.
"
11913,"Elizabeth and I are going out of town.
"
11914,"-That's great!
"
11915,"-Yeah.
"
11916,"Think of all the money
"
11917,"that you're gonna make!
"
11918,"Why? What?
"
11919,"Well, her father pays you
"
11920,"for babysitting, right?
"
11921,"No, no. That's funny.
"
11922,"But maybe it's time to move on.
"
11923,"You know, let it go. Stop it!
"
11924,"Besides, Rachel's going out
"
11925,"with Elizabeth's father.
"
11926,"So he's much older than she is.
"
11927,"Looks like I'm not the only one
"
11928,"interested in fossils.
"
11929,"Ross, all that does is remind us
"
11930,"that you are interested in fossils.
"
11931,"Okay, okay.
"
11932,"Rachel's gonna need to yell sweet nothings
"
11933,"in his ear.
"
11934,"-Ross?
"
11935,"-Come on! That's funny, you know?
"
11936,"'Cause he's got like a hearing aid,
"
11937,"you know?
"
11938,"'Cause he's all old.
"
11939,"One second.
"
11940,"Okay, look, Ross.
"
11941,"So you know,
"
11942,"since Lizzie likes you so much...
"
11943,"...l've accepted the fact
"
11944,"that you two are dating.
"
11945,"Really? Okay, that's great.
"
11946,"Yeah. But then I changed my mind.
"
11947,"I'm funny like that.
"
11948,"I told Lizzie and now I'm telling you.
"
11949,"I don't want you seeing
"
11950,"my daughter anymore.
"
11951,"All right, look. I realize it upsets you.
"
11952,"Yes, it does.
"
11953,"But Elizabeth and I are both adults...
"
11954,"...so I don't think there's really anything
"
11955,"you can do about it.
"
11956,"I'll inform the university
"
11957,"of your relationship, and have you fired.
"
11958,"A man with a plan!
"
11959,"The One Where Paul's The Man
"
11960,"English subtitles by Softitler
"
11961,"This is so exciting. You get your picture
"
11962,"back up on the wall of fame.
"
11963,"I know.
"
11964,"It was so cool when it was up there before.
"
11965,"Me and Jim Belushi would just be
"
11966,"cracking up about something.
"
11967,"Then I get fired off Days of Our Lives
"
11968,"and he takes me down.
"
11969,"Now he's just laughing at me.
"
11970,"Look at him. That smug Belushi bastard!
"
11971,"Okay. Maybe when they put your picture
"
11972,"back up...
"
11973,"...they could put you next to Matt Lauer.
"
11974,"Look at him just smiling at me.
"
11975,"Yeah, I know. We'd be great together.
"
11976,"-So I'm back.
"
11977,"-Who are you?
"
11978,"Joey Tribbiani.
"
11979,"From the wall?
"
11980,"Okay, maybe this will jog your memory.
"
11981,"Okay, anyway.
"
11982,"I'm ready to go back up on the wall.
"
11983,"I'm the star of a new TV show.
"
11984,"-Show me in the TV book.
"
11985,"-Well, it's not on TV yet.
"
11986,"Well, then it's not on the wall yet.
"
11987,"Okay, fine. I will bring you a tape.
"
11988,"So, do you have any
"
11989,"of Matt Lauer's clothes here?
"
11990,"Maybe?
"
11991,"Just ones that haven't been cleaned yet?
"
11992,"Fine.
"
11993,"I love museums.
"
11994,"-Soaking up all the culture.
"
11995,"-Yeah.
"
11996,"-Where do you want to start?
"
11997,"-The gift shop!
"
11998,"-And then lunch.
"
11999,"-Yes, but I can't eat too much.
"
12000,"Paul's taking me out to dinner tonight.
"
12001,"He said he has a big surprise planned.
"
12002,"What do you think?
"
12003,"Maybe he's gonna tell you he's gay?
"
12004,"What? No, why?
"
12005,"No reason. That would just be
"
12006,"a really big surprise, right?
"
12007,"You could put the aisle over here
"
12008,"and have the wedding ceremony here.
"
12009,"I didn't know you could get married here.
"
12010,"This would be a beautiful place
"
12011,"to get married.
"
12012,"But I wouldn't put the aisle there.
"
12013,"And I'd never have the ceremony there.
"
12014,"You'd have the ceremony
"
12015,"under this beautiful arch.
"
12016,"May I help you?
"
12017,"Sorry. Didn't mean to interrupt.
"
12018,"It's a beautiful space.
"
12019,"-Do you do a lot of weddings here?
"
12020,"-Yes, we're popular.
"
12021,"There's a two-year waiting list. Sorry.
"
12022,"You should totally put
"
12023,"your name down for this place.
"
12024,"What? Are you crazy?
"
12025,"I'm not getting married.
"
12026,"I'm not even engaged.
"
12027,"There's a two-year wait.
"
12028,"What if you get engaged in two years?
"
12029,"Then you've gotta wait another two years?
"
12030,"That's four years.
"
12031,"Chandler's not gonna wait that long.
"
12032,"He's gonna find somebody else, you know?
"
12033,"Someone who did put their name
"
12034,"on the list.
"
12035,"Yeah. It can't hurt to put your name down.
"
12036,"I mean, in two years, if you're not engaged,
"
12037,"you just don't use it.
"
12038,"Well, I guess there is no harm
"
12039,"in putting my name down.
"
12040,"I'm gonna do it, too.
"
12041,"Me, too!
"
12042,"Really? Who would you marry?
"
12043,"I don't know.
"
12044,"I don't have anyone right now.
"
12045,"Oh, Pheebs.
"
12046,"Don't feel too sorry for me.
"
12047,"At least my boyfriend isn't gay.
"
12048,"Phoebe, that's not--
"
12049,"Don't even get me started on yours.
"
12050,"-So, did you watch the tape of my show?
"
12051,"-I did.
"
12052,"-All right. Let's get me back up there.
"
12053,"-No. You don't go up on the wall.
"
12054,"-What? But you saw the show.
"
12055,"-Yes. It was very offensive to my people.
"
12056,"Dry cleaners?
"
12057,"Russians. It showed them
"
12058,"as terrorists and villains.
"
12059,"Okay, okay.
"
12060,"Look, you got Harrison Ford up there!
"
12061,"That's right.
"
12062,"Mr. Ford is a very good customer.
"
12063,"He brings us a lot of clothes.
"
12064,"You bring us nothing!
"
12065,"Okay, that may be true.
"
12066,"But in Air Force One, okay,
"
12067,"the Russians were terrorists and evil!
"
12068,"And plus, he kills a bunch of them.
"
12069,"That's offensive to Russians.
"
12070,"I've never seen it.
"
12071,"You should. It's great!
"
12072,"This place is really beautiful.
"
12073,"Yeah. I've been coming here since I was
"
12074,"a kid. This used to be my grandma's.
"
12075,"The only thing I got
"
12076,"from my grandmother was her eyes.
"
12077,"I mean, not her actual eyeballs.
"
12078,"But people say that my eyes look....
"
12079,"Do you want to make out?
"
12080,"Sure.
"
12081,"Are you okay?
"
12082,"What's wrong?
"
12083,"Yeah. I was just thinking
"
12084,"about your father.
"
12085,"Well, whatever works for you.
"
12086,"No.
"
12087,"He just really freaked me out before.
"
12088,"So we have to hide our relationship
"
12089,"from one more person.
"
12090,"Big deal.
"
12091,"Besides, we've had fun hiding it.
"
12092,"Yeah.
"
12093,"-Yeah?
"
12094,"-You brought protection, right?
"
12095,"Why? Are there like bears or something?
"
12096,"Protection. Yeah. No, yeah.
"
12097,"That, that I forgot.
"
12098,"-I'll just run to the store and get some.
"
12099,"-No. I'm the guy. I'll get it.
"
12100,"-Do you know where the store is?
"
12101,"-No.
"
12102,"Do you want to ride around town
"
12103,"on my little pink bicycle?
"
12104,"A little bit.
"
12105,"-I'll be back in 10 minutes.
"
12106,"-Okay.
"
12107,"Why don't you get in the hot tub
"
12108,"and I'll meet you there.
"
12109,"Okay.
"
12110,"Oh, my God! What a great surprise!
"
12111,"This is such a beautiful house!
"
12112,"Thank you. It used to be my mother's.
"
12113,"This is the kitchen.
"
12114,"You've reached Monica and Chandler's.
"
12115,"If you're listening to this message,
"
12116,"we're probably screening.
"
12117,"Yeah, we are.
"
12118,"Hi, this is Hildy
"
12119,"from the Morgan Chase Museum.
"
12120,"I'm calling for Monica Geller.
"
12121,"There's been a cancellation.
"
12122,"If she's still interested in having
"
12123,"the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility...
"
12124,"...it is available.
"
12125,"This is Chandler Bing!
"
12126,"Yes, the groom!
"
12127,"No, not the groom!
"
12128,"It's so secluded up here.
"
12129,"I know. That's why I like it here.
"
12130,"I feel like we're the only two people
"
12131,"in the world.
"
12132,"Sorry.
"
12133,"What's the matter, honey?
"
12134,"-Did you see a little mouse?
"
12135,"-No! Big bear! Big bear outside!
"
12136,"I think l....
"
12137,"Actually, would you go check on that?
"
12138,"Honey, we don't have any bears here.
"
12139,"Well, okay.
"
12140,"Would you get me a Diet Coke?
"
12141,"-Okay. Be right back.
"
12142,"-Okay.
"
12143,"-What are you doing here?
"
12144,"-What are you doing here?
"
12145,"-I came with Paul!
"
12146,"-Yeah. I recognized the ankles.
"
12147,"Hurry up. Get out.
"
12148,"Here you go, honey.
"
12149,"-Thank you!
"
12150,"-Diet Coke.
"
12151,"Ice.
"
12152,"I need ice.
"
12153,"Okay.
"
12154,"-Thank you.
"
12155,"-Be right back.
"
12156,"Okay.
"
12157,"You and your ice.
"
12158,"Get out! Get out! Go! Come on!
"
12159,"No, not in there! Not in there!
"
12160,"He's in there!
"
12161,"-Did you really hear a bear?
"
12162,"-Go!
"
12163,"Here you go, honey.
"
12164,"One Diet Coke with ice.
"
12165,"Thank you.
"
12166,"I am so happy that you're here.
"
12167,"-Here I am!
"
12168,"-Elizabeth!
"
12169,"Look! Elizabeth's here!
"
12170,"Who were you talking to?
"
12171,"You guys?
"
12172,"How did you know we were here?
"
12173,"Well, she obviously saw the tire tracks
"
12174,"that were leading up to the closed garage.
"
12175,"Obviously.
"
12176,"What are you doing here?
"
12177,"Did you come up here to work on
"
12178,"that term paper or something?
"
12179,"Yeah.
"
12180,"Well, why don't you go in that room
"
12181,"and do your homework?
"
12182,"I wouldn't do it in there.
"
12183,"That's my dad's bedroom.
"
12184,"That's your dad's bedroom.
"
12185,"That's your dad's bedroom!
"
12186,"Why are you yelling?
"
12187,"That Diet Coke, I think,
"
12188,"went straight to my head!
"
12189,"Hi, honey.
"
12190,"See you later.
"
12191,"Wait. I bought groceries.
"
12192,"I was gonna make you dinner.
"
12193,"Well, next time, ask!
"
12194,"Or at least wait for me to ask!
"
12195,"Hi, this is Hildy
"
12196,"from the Morgan Chase Museum.
"
12197,"I'm calling for Monica Geller.
"
12198,"Oh, no.
"
12199,"There's been a cancellation.
"
12200,"If she's still interested in having
"
12201,"the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility...
"
12202,"...it is available.
"
12203,"Please. He didn't hear it!
"
12204,"This is Chandler Bing!
"
12205,"No!
"
12206,"Can I help you?
"
12207,"Yeah. Where's the guy who decides
"
12208,"whose pictures go up on the wall?
"
12209,"-He's not here right now.
"
12210,"-You're kidding me!
"
12211,"Well, make sure you tell him that
"
12212,"Joey Tribbiani dropped off these clothes.
"
12213,"I'm an actor. I'm trying to get
"
12214,"my picture up there on the wall.
"
12215,"You know, there are two people
"
12216,"who could get your picture up there.
"
12217,"Oh, really?
"
12218,"Well, maybe you and I go out for drinks.
"
12219,"You're the other one, right?
"
12220,"So, are you planning on staying the night?
"
12221,"No, no. Believe me,
"
12222,"I'm leaving as soon as possible.
"
12223,"Good. Not that we don't want you to stay.
"
12224,"Obviously, you're welcome.
"
12225,"How much more homework do you have?
"
12226,"I just have one problem left
"
12227,"that I do not know how to solve.
"
12228,"Rachel, maybe you want to come upstairs
"
12229,"and help me figure it out?
"
12230,"Really?
"
12231,"Okay.
"
12232,"Okay, I'll go upstairs...
"
12233,"...if you get me something from the car.
"
12234,"What do you need from the car?
"
12235,"Surprise me.
"
12236,"Okay.
"
12237,"So you're gonna be in the car!
"
12238,"I will be upstairs!
"
12239,"And that's where everybody's gonna be!
"
12240,"Just relax. Just relax, Paul.
"
12241,"You're doing great.
"
12242,"She likes you.
"
12243,"I think she likes you. She likes you.
"
12244,"You know why?
"
12245,"Because you're a neat guy.
"
12246,"You are the man.
"
12247,"You are the man!
"
12248,"Still got it.
"
12249,"Still sexy.
"
12250,"You're just a love machine.

"
12257,"-Yeah?
"
12258,"-Have you seen Chandler?
"
12259,"-No, why?
"
12260,"The museum called and said
"
12261,"that there was a cancellation...
"
12262,"...and that we could move up our wedding.
"
12263,"And Chandler heard.
"
12264,"I know. How bad is this?
"
12265,"Well, with a regular guy it's bad.
"
12266,"With Chandler, oh, dear God!
"
12267,"I know! He totally freaked out
"
12268,"and I can't find him anywhere!
"
12269,"-What are you gonna do?
"
12270,"-I'm never listening to you again, for sure.
"
12271,"""What harm can it do
"

"
12273,"-Rachel said that.
"
12274,"-Well, Rachel's not here!
"
12275,"Here it is!
"
12276,"Joey, why did you sign it, ""son of a bitch""?
"
12277,"-I didn't do that. Who would've done that?
"
12278,"-Son of a bitch!
"
12279,"Okay. Maybe ask this guy.
"
12280,"You! Get out of my shop!
"
12281,"-What did he do?
"
12282,"-He went out with my wife!
"
12283,"Joey!
"
12284,"I did not go out with your wife! Okay?
"
12285,"I went out with her.
"
12286,"That's my wife!
"
12287,"Get out!
"
12288,"-Well, we should go.
"
12289,"-Yeah.
"
12290,"Ross?
"
12291,"Elizabeth!
"
12292,"Okay. I'm gonna go out this window.
"
12293,"I'll meet you at the front door.
"
12294,"Just tell them you're going home, okay?
"
12295,"-Okay.
"
12296,"-Wait, wait! No, don't go in there!
"
12297,"Don't go in there! I need another soda!

12298,"Ross!
"
12299,"Oh, my God! What in heaven's name
"

"
12302,"we cannot see each other anymore.
"
12303,"Ross, you and I are gonna have
"

"
12305,"-Daddy, l--
"
12306,"-You're next!
"
12307,"Okay. I didn't know he was here.
"
12308,"Let's see if I got this straight.
"
12309,"I tell you to stay away
"
12310,"from my daughter or I'll have you fired.
"
12311,"What you heard was: ""Take my daughter...
"
12312,"""...come up to my country house
"
12313,"and ruin my weekend with Rachel.""
"
12314,"-Okay. Please, Paul. Just let me explain.
"
12315,"-No! Let me explain! Fired!
"
12316,"Okay, fine. Fine. Have me fired.
"
12317,"But, I want you to know...
"
12318,"...that you and I are not all that different.
"
12319,"I mean...
"
12320,"...l, too, am a ""neat guy.""

"
12325,"-Okay.
"
12326,"I'm so sorry. Please stop freaking out.
"
12327,"I'm not freaking out.
"
12328,"Why would I freak out?
"
12329,"Hildy called and said
"
12330,"we were getting married.
"
12331,"But that happens every day.
"
12332,"Honey, we were at this beautiful place.
"
12333,"And I just put our names down for fun.
"
12334,"-I mean, what's the harm in that?
"
12335,"-Right here.
"
12336,"Please don't think I was trying
"
12337,"to pressure you.
"
12338,"-Phoebe and Rachel thought--
"
12339,"-Phoebe and Rachel?
"
12340,"So the people that knew
"
12341,"about our wedding before me were you...
"
12342,"...Phoebe, Rachel, Hildy, and some band
"
12343,"called, Star Light Magic Seven...
"
12344,"...who are available, by the way.
"
12345,"It was a mistake.
"
12346,"Please don't take this to mean anything,
"
12347,"because it doesn't.
"
12348,"Okay.
"
12349,"Really?
"
12350,"Yes. If it really doesn't mean anything,
"
12351,"because I'm just not ready.
"
12352,"I know.
"
12353,"I know.
"
12354,"Okay.
"
12355,"All right.
"
12356,"I'm gonna go tell Joey that you're back.
"
12357,"We were really worried about you.
"
12358,"Did she buy it?
"
12359,"Totally.
"
12360,"-So did Hildy show you the place?
"
12361,"-Yeah. It's beautiful.
"
12362,"I can't believe
"
12363,"you're gonna ask Monica to marry you.
"
12364,"I know.
"
12365,"-Hey, Gunther.
"
12366,"-Take these cappuccinos to table 1 1 .

"

"
12371,"Do you still work here?
"
12372,"No. I quit a long time ago.
"

"
12404,"Good.
"
12405,"Although, you know,

"
12407,"I wish I could get him to open up.

"
12428,"That was so weird, huh?
"
12429,"Why did you do it?
"

"
12433,"-Oh, please. I think you know why.

"
12435,"Come on. You're a paleontologist.

"
12437,"Is it because Joey and I didn't

"
12440,"he'd be mad at you for?
"

12442,"-Well, then I think that's it.

"
12487,"When I was 6 years old,

12493,"It was embarrassing.

12527,"An engagement bracelet.
"

"
12529,"An engagement Revolutionary War musket!
"
12530,"I'm so glad I picked you

"
12539,"This is the reason you brought me.
"
12540,"I know how to haggle.
"
12541,"Let me handle this from here.
"
12542,"Can I help you?
"
12543,"-I would like to see that ring, please.
"
12544,"-Or not. Whatever.
"
12545,"This ring is from the 1 920s.
"
12546,"It's a one and a half carat diamond
"
12547,"with sapphires.
"
12548,"Sir, could I ask you to. . .?
"
12549,"Could you hold out that ring
"
12550,"and ask me to marry you?
"
12551,"-Okay.
"
12552,"-Okay.
"
12553,"Will you marry me?
"
12554,"Oh, my God, that's it!
"
12555,"That's the ring!
"
12556,"-How much is it?
"
12557,"-I will handle this.
"
12558,"How much is it?
"
12559,"$8600.
"
12560,"We will give you $1 0.
"
12561,"-Are you interested in this ring?
"
12562,"-Yes.
"
12563,"But I can only pay $8000.
"
12564,"-Okay. I can let it go for 8.
"
12565,"-We stand firm at $1 0.
"
12566,"-How'd you like to pay?
"
12567,"-Credit card.
"
12568,"Oh, no! I lent my
"
12569,"credit card to Joey.
"
12570,"I'll go get it.
"
12571,"You guard the ring.
"
12572,"Listen, I'm sorry about before.
"
12573,"Do you have anything here for $1 0?
"
12574,"Yes. I have these two
"
12575,"rather beautiful. . .
"
12576,". . .five-dollar bills.
"
12577,"I'll give you $1 for them.
"
12578,"Remember how Chandler
"
12579,"and Phoebe blew us off yesterday?
"
12580,"No.
"
12581,"-Remember, you were eating pizza?
"
12582,"-Yeah.
"
12583,"Chandler's angry at us for not getting
"
12584,"him a ticket to that Knicks game.
"
12585,"We were supposed to just get him one?
"
12586,"That guy's always mooching off of us.
"
12587,"Anyway, I still think we should
"
12588,"try to patch things up.
"
12589,"We could get him tickets to another
"
12590,"Knicks game and invite him.
"
12591,"That's a great idea.
"
12592,"And I still have his credit card.
"
12593,"Here you go.
"
12594,"Hey, hey. I got this one.
"
12595,"Here you go.
"
12596,"Sometimes I just don't get Chandler.
"
12597,"We do stuff all the time without you,
"
12598,"and you don't get all upset.
"
12599,"-All the time?
"
12600,"-All the time.
"
12601,"Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
"
12602,"-Still crying?
"
12603,"-Like a little girl.
"
12604,"I know, I know. This is all my fault.
"
12605,"I wanted him to open up.
"
12606,"I didn't know that
"
12607,"I was gonna unleash. . .
"
12608,". . .this weepy, clingy,
"
12609,"moist monster!
"
12610,"I only know of two sure-fire ways
"
12611,"to shut a man up.
"
12612,"One of them is sex.
"
12613,"-What's the other?
"
12614,"-Don't know. Never had to use it.
"
12615,"I'm just saying, if we're having sex,
"
12616,"he's not talking.
"
12617,"That's right. You're the talker.
"
12618,"Anyway, great idea.
"
12619,"I gotta buy him some more tissues.
"
12620,"-We have some here.
"
12621,"-No, you don't!
"
12622,"Okay. I'd also like
"
12623,"to try on the tiara.
"
12624,"Oh, yeah. Okay.
"
12625,"What do you think? Too much?
"
12626,"A tad.
"
12627,"Take the tiara back. . .
"
12628,". . .and let me hold the musket again.
"
12629,"Something's missing.
"
12630,"Let me see the ring that
"
12631,"my friend picked out.
"
12632,"Where's the 1 920s princess-cut ring?
"
12633,"I just sold it to that gentleman.
"
12634,"Oh, my God!
"
12635,"Wait, no!
"
12636,"Let me out! Now!
"
12637,"Rachel?
"
12638,"No.
"
12639,"-How are you, Paul?
"
12640,"-Okay.
"
12641,"Chandler. . .
"
12642,"-. . .did your dad ever hug you?
"
12643,"-No. Did he hug you?
"
12644,"No! No.
"
12645,"It's just that my dad never did.
"
12646,"I miss my dad.
"
12647,"You can see my dad in Vegas
"
12648,"kissing other dads.
"
12649,"-Hey, Chandler?
"
12650,"-Yeah?
"
12651,"Would you. . .?
"
12652,"Would you hug me?
"
12653,"-I'm a little busy here, Paul.
"
12654,"-That's what my dad used to say.
"
12655,"Okay. A quick one.
"
12656,"Come on, hug it out.
"
12657,"There you go.
"
12658,"Okay.
"
12659,"-Five more seconds--
"
12660,"-Okay!
"
12661,"-Joey!
"
12662,"-What? Hey, what--?
"
12663,"Hi. Paul, is it?
"
12664,"-Do you have my credit card?
"
12665,"-Yeah. It's in my. . . .
"
12666,"In my pocket.
"
12667,"-My back pocket!
"
12668,"-Thank God.
"
12669,"-I got tickets to the Knicks tonight.
"
12670,"-I can't go.
"
12671,"It'll be fun.
"
12672,"Me, you, Ross and. . . .
"
12673,"Paul, probably.
"
12674,"Chandler, I found the perfect ring.
"
12675,"I'm gonna go with
"
12676,"the one I picked first.
"
12677,"Oh, wake up, Chandler. The one
"
12678,"you picked is gone. It's over!
"
12679,"What?
"
12680,"Some guy bought it. I tried to stop
"
12681,"him but they put me in jail!
"
12682,"-They put you in jail?
"
12683,"-The little jail between the doors!
"
12684,"-I asked you to guard the ring!
"
12685,"-I know! I'm sorry.
"
12686,"But this ring is better. And Monica
"
12687,"never even saw the other ring.
"
12688,"Yeah. But when he proposed to me
"
12689,"with the ring, I got goosebumps.
"
12690,"-Maybe it was the guy.
"
12691,"-It was the ring!
"
12692,"-Was he excited about the tickets?
"
12693,"-No! He blew us off!
"
12694,"-What?
"
12695,"-I know.
"
12696,"I can't believe it.
"
12697,"Can I tell you something?
"
12698,"I'm a little mad at him now!
"
12699,"Can I tell you something?
"
12700,"Me too!
"
12701,"He didn't want to talk to us
"
12702,"about being angry?
"
12703,"Maybe we don't talk to him at all!
"
12704,"-Freeze him out.
"
12705,"-Right!
"
12706,"-I like it.
"
12707,"-We'll show him.
"
12708,"From now on, it's gonna be
"
12709,"Joey and Ross, best friends.
"
12710,"We'll be the new Joey and Chandler.
"
12711,"Hi, I'm back.
"
12712,"I've written down more to tell you!
"
12713,"Oh, that's great.
"
12714,"No, actually, that's. . . .
"
12715,"That's great. That's really great.
"
12716,"You know, I gotta tell you, writing,
"
12717,"all that writing, it gets me. . . .
"
12718,"It gets me kind of hot.
"
12719,"Wait, wait. Listen to this:
"
12720,"Know what I wanted to be at that age?
"
12721,"A lover?
"
12722,"-A surfer.
"
12723,"-A surfer?
"
12724,"-I wanted to be one with the waves--
"
12725,"-Hold on.
"
12726,"Let me just get
"
12727,"a little more comfortable here.
"
12728,"Wait a second.
"
12729,"-This isn't too revealing, is it?
"
12730,"-No.
"
12731,"Whatever happened to that little dude?
"
12732,"So full of dreams.
"
12733,"I don't care about the little dude!
"
12734,"I can't! I cannot listen
"
12735,"to any more of this!
"
12736,"The only one who'd listen
"
12737,"is a mental health professional!
"
12738,"That's only because
"
12739,"they get $1 00 an hour!
"
12740,"Do you know how much money I could've
"
12741,"made listening to you? $2000!
"
12742,"Know when I figured that out?
"
12743,"While you were talking!
"
12744,"I can't believe you're trying
"
12745,"to stifle me, when 1 4 hours ago. . .
"
12746,". . .we figured out that that's what
"
12747,"my mother was trying to do to me!
"
12748,"I'm sorry.
"
12749,"I don't mean. . . .
"
12750,"I didn't mean to stifle you.
"
12751,"This is all just
"
12752,"a little overwhelming.
"
12753,"I'm so sorry.
"
12754,"I didn't mean to overwhelm you.
"
12755,"It's just that
"
12756,"when those gates open. . .
"
12757,". . .it's hard to close them.
"
12758,"But they are closed now. Believe me.
"
12759,"I'm so glad. I'm so glad you shared.
"
12760,"And I'm glad that you're done.
"
12761,"So what do you say we. . . .
"
12762,"I'd really like that.
"
12763,"That was so good!
"
12764,"Oh, oh.
"
12765,"I can't believe you talked me into
"
12766,"this gumball-machine-looking ring.
"
12767,"It's not gumball machine-looking.
"
12768,"It's a beautiful ring!
"
12769,"No, it's not.
"
12770,"When I looked at the other ring,
"
12771,"I could see Monica's face. . .
"
12772,". . .and see her saying yes.
"
12773,"When I look at this,
"
12774,"all I see is a ring.
"
12775,"Unless I look at it really closely,
"
12776,"and then I can see my own eye.
"
12777,"This is the most important thing I'll
"
12778,"ever do. I want to make it perfect.
"
12779,"Maybe we could get
"
12780,"the other ring back.
"
12781,"I heard where
"
12782,"the guy was gonna propose.
"
12783,"Maybe we could get him to trade rings.
"
12784,"I can't do that.
"
12785,"You certainly can't give her
"
12786,"that stupid gumball ring.
"
12787,"There he is.
"
12788,"He hasn't proposed yet.
"
12789,"She has no ring on her finger.
"
12790,"Wow, you're good!
"
12791,"After this, we should solve crimes.
"
12792,"Okay. Go get him.
"
12793,"Oh, okay.
"
12794,"Excuse me, sir. Could you
"
12795,"come with me? You have a phone call.
"
12796,"-Who is it?
"
12797,"-It is your office.
"
12798,"-Do you know who at my office?
"
12799,"-John.
"
12800,"Oh, John! Great!
"
12801,"-There he is.
"
12802,"-Hi. Okay.
"
12803,"There was a mix-up at the store.
"
12804,"The ring you have was supposed
"
12805,"to be held for me.
"
12806,"I'm gonna need to have that back.
"
12807,"In exchange, I'm willing to trade you
"
12808,"this beautiful, more expensive ring.
"
12809,"Wow, I would trade.
"
12810,"It is beautiful, but I'm gonna use
"
12811,"this one. Excuse me.
"
12812,"This is my fiancï¿½e,
"
12813,"and her heart was set on that ring.
"
12814,"Do you want to break her heart?
"
12815,"Yeah. Do you want to break
"
12816,"a dying woman's heart?
"
12817,"You're dying?
"
12818,"Yeah, she's dying. . .
"
12819,". . .of a cough, apparently.
"
12820,"It's my dying wish to have that ring.
"
12821,"If I'm not buried with it. . .
"
12822,". . .my spirit will wander
"
12823,"the netherworld--
"
12824,"That's enough, honey!
"
12825,"Oh, I don't know.
"
12826,"-Let me see it.
"

"

"
12830,"-Thank you.
"

13054,"-Are you okay?
"
13055,"-Yes. Yes.
"
13056,"I'm good. Are you good?
"
13057,"Are you perfect?
"
13058,"Yeah. I'm okay.
"
13059,"I'm a little cold.
"
13060,"Can I have your jacket?
"
13061,"No, you can't have my jacket.
"
13062,"Because then I would be cold.
"
13063,"If you thought you'd be cold,
"
13064,"you should have brought a jacket.
"
13065,"Other than that, are you okay?
"
13066,"Are you sure you're okay?
"
13067,"Yes. I'm fine.
"
13068,"In fact, I've been fine
"
13069,"for a long time now and I think. . .
"
13070,". . .the reason is you.
"
13071,"That's sweet.
"
13072,"Before I met you,
"
13073,"I had really little life.
"
13074,"And I couldn't imagine growing old--
"
13075,"Oh, my God.
"
13076,"-I know. But let me say it.
"
13077,"-Oh, my God. Richard.
"
13078,"What? I'm Chandler.
"
13079,"Oh, that's Richard.
"
13080,"Maybe he won't see us.
"
13081,"Richard!
"
13082,"Monica. Chandler.
"
13083,"I don't know why I did that.
"
13084,"-It's good to see you.
"
13085,"-You too. You let your hair grow.
"
13086,"Oh, that's right,
"
13087,"you always wanted me to.
"
13088,"I see your mustache is back.
"
13089,"Well, my nose got lonely.
"
13090,"And you don't have a mustache,
"
13091,"which is good.
"
13092,"I'm Chandler.
"
13093,"I make jokes when I'm uncomfortable.
"
13094,"I'm sorry. Lisa, Monica, Chandler.
"
13095,"We used to date.
"
13096,"No one's supposed to know about us!
"
13097,"See, I did it again.
"
13098,"-Chandler, sit down.
"
13099,"-I'll sit down.
"
13100,"Good to see you.
"
13101,"Your table is ready, sir.
"
13102,"Good to see you guys.
"
13103,"If you prefer, this table's available.
"
13104,"That might be fun.
"
13105,"What were you thinking?
"
13106,"I didn't know it was an auction.
"
13107,"I figured I'd take a guess.
"
13108,"Help a charity. Free boat!
"
13109,"Why would a charity
"
13110,"give away a free boat?
"
13111,"I don't know. Charity?
"
13112,"Well, just buy the damn boat.
"
13113,"Don't you think
"
13114,"you've had enough to drink?
"
13115,"I'm just helping the kids.
"
13116,"How is you drinking helping the kids?
"
13117,"Because the more I drink, the less
"
13118,"there is for the kids to drink.
"
13119,"Mr. Tribbiani.
"
13120,"Your contribution brings us. . .
"
13121,". . .a big step closer
"
13122,"to building the youth center.
"
13123,"Just out of curiosity,
"
13124,"how much is that boat worth?
"
13125,"I think it was valued at 1 9,000.
"
13126,"Hey, I was pretty close.
"
13127,"So, bad news.
"
13128,"I can't buy the boat.
"
13129,"I don't have any money.
"
13130,"Joey! Joey, good one!
"
13131,"Good! Very good!
"
13132,"-So I think I'm gonna take off now.
"
13133,"-You can't leave, Joey!
"
13134,"You agreed to buy that boat.
"
13135,"It is a contract.
"
13136,"Plus, if you leave,
"
13137,"my boss is gonna kill me.
"
13138,"I don't have that kind of money.
"
13139,"I know. Okay, okay, okay, okay.
"
13140,"This is what we'll do.
"
13141,"We'll go to the next highest bidder,
"
13142,"and we'll let them buy it.
"
13143,"Then you're just gonna
"
13144,"pay the difference.
"
13145,"Okay.
"
13146,"I don't know why the kids need a
"
13147,"youth center anyway.
"
13148,"They should just watch TV after school
"
13149,"like I did. And I turned out fine.
"
13150,"Not great.
"
13151,"So we're hiding in the bathroom. . . .
"
13152,"Then I sneak out. But before
"
13153,"Monica can, her parents come in.
"
13154,"I hid in the shower,
"
13155,"next thing you know. . .
"
13156,". . .they're going at it on the floor.
"
13157,"Oh, my God!
"
13158,"I got a good one.
"
13159,"I once walked in on both my parents
"
13160,"making love to the same guy.
"
13161,"It's so great seeing you guys again.
"
13162,"I'd like to make a toast.
"
13163,"As a poet once said, ""In the sweetness
"
13164,"of friendship. . .
"
13165,". . .Iet there be laughter
"
13166,"and sharing of pleasures. . .
"
13167,". . .for in the dew of little things. . .
"
13168,". . .the heart finds its morning and is
"
13169,"refreshed. ""
"
13170,"What?
"
13171,"Oh, my God! You guys!
"
13172,"Have we got a story for you.
"
13173,"Guess who we bumped into?
"
13174,"-Who?
"
13175,"-Richard!
"
13176,"I thought you were going out.
"
13177,"I was. She was a little busy
"
13178,"with a water balloon fight.
"
13179,"Sometimes grownups have commitments
"
13180,"they can't get out of.
"
13181,"Maybe she is too young for me.
"
13182,"When I was over there,
"
13183,"I felt like I was a babysitter.
"
13184,"I finally see what you were talking
"
13185,"about. I don't know what to do.
"
13186,"Just weigh the good stuff about
"
13187,"the relationship against the bad.
"
13188,"That's what I did when I first started
"
13189,"weighing stuff.
"
13190,"Okay, bad stuff.
"
13191,"I'm 1 2 years older than she is.
"
13192,"If school finds out, you're fired.
"
13193,"-She's leaving for three months.
"
13194,"-For camp.
"
13195,"Okay, good stuff.
"
13196,"Well, she's sweet and pretty and. . . .
"
13197,"The only question you need to ask
"
13198,"is, do you see a future?
"
13199,"Do you see yourself marrying her?
"
13200,"My God. You married her, didn't you?
"
13201,"No, I didn't do that.
"
13202,"It's just. . . .
"
13203,"Honestly, no,
"
13204,"I don't see a big future with her.
"
13205,"Okay, I think that's your answer.
"
13206,"I gotta talk to her.
"
13207,"I hate this part.
"
13208,"Forget Elizabeth.
"
13209,"If you're not careful. . .
"
13210,". . .you may not get married
"
13211,"at all this year.
"
13212,"-Next highest bidder is at table one.
"
13213,"-Great.
"
13214,"The guy who got the Paris trip
"
13215,"is at table four.
"
13216,"-You care about the guy who won?
"
13217,"-It's a trip for two.
"
13218,"Excuse me.
"
13219,"Is the person who won the
"
13220,"Paris trip at this table?
"
13221,"-That was me.
"
13222,"-Enchantï¿½.
"
13223,"-Is there a Mr. Bowmont at this table?
"
13224,"-That's me.
"
13225,"Hello. This is your
"
13226,"lucky day, Mr. Bowmont.
"
13227,"The Gentleman Daysailer
"
13228,"has become available again.
"
13229,"I believe you made a bid of $1 8,000?
"
13230,"You have to pay that.
"
13231,"It's not just a guess.
"
13232,"I was actually relieved
"
13233,"I didn't win the boat.
"
13234,"My wife would've killed me.
"
13235,"Are you kidding?
"
13236,"She'll love this boat!
"
13237,"-What is your wife's name?
"
13238,"-It's Pam.
"
13239,"It's Pam. Just imagine this.
"
13240,"The Pam.
"
13241,"I don't think she'd like that.
"
13242,"Imagine this:
"
13243,"The Mr. Bowmont.
"
13244,"I don't think so.
"
13245,"Let me paint you a little picture.
"
13246,"You are setting sail up the Hudson.
"
13247,"You've got the wind in your arms.
"
13248,"You get all that peace and quiet
"
13249,"you've always wanted.
"
13250,"You get back to nature.
"
13251,"You can go fishing.
"
13252,"You get one of those hats,
"
13253,"people call you captain.
"
13254,"And then when you're old, Cappy.
"
13255,"It's for a good cause.
"
13256,"All right!
"
13257,"-No way! It's mine!
"
13258,"-What?
"
13259,"The stuff you said, I want that!
"
13260,"But, Joey, you don't have $20,000!
"
13261,"Who cares? I'll make payments!
"
13262,"I want the Mr. Bowmont!
"
13263,"You're back!
"
13264,"Let me see your hand!
"
13265,"Why do you want to see my hand?
"
13266,"I want to see what's in your hand,
"
13267,"the trash.
"
13268,"It's all dirty.
"
13269,"You should throw this out.
"
13270,"-What did you just do?
"
13271,"-What happened?
"
13272,"-Richard was there. I couldn't do it.
"
13273,"-Oh, no.
"
13274,"I was gonna surprise her tomorrow.
"
13275,"Now you've ruined it.
"
13276,"We didn't.
"
13277,"You walk in here and
"
13278,"ask to see her hand!
"
13279,"A palm reader, a manicurist,
"
13280,"a hand doctor.
"
13281,"-Glove salesman.
"
13282,"-Good one!
"
13283,"This is terrible.
"
13284,"What am I gonna do?
"
13285,"She only suspects something.
"
13286,"So just throw her off the track.
"
13287,"I'll make her think marriage
"
13288,"is the last thing on my mind.
"
13289,"Convince her you're scared
"
13290,"of commitment.
"
13291,"I can do that.
"
13292,"I've had 30 years of practice.
"
13293,"Being you is finally gonna pay off!
"
13294,"Had to go to the basement. . .
"
13295,". . .some idiot keeps stuffing
"
13296,"the chute with pizza boxes.
"
13297,"That guy's still doing that?
"
13298,"My God, let me see your hand!
"
13299,"No, you're too late!
"
13300,"She already took out the trash!
"
13301,"I have never had
"
13302,"such a healthy breakup.
"
13303,"She was such a grownup about it.
"
13304,"She didn 't seem too immature for me.
"
13305,"Did ljust make a huge mistake?
"
13306,"Ross? Wait!
"
13307,"Elizabeth, thank God.
"
13308,"I was just thinking about--
"
13309,"You suck!
"
13310,"What?
"
13311,"Breakup's still on.
"
13312,"Here she comes.
"
13313,"Do I look like
"
13314,"I don't want to get married?
"
13315,"And, also, a little like a
"
13316,"French guy.
"
13317,"I never noticed that before.
"
13318,"What are you up to?
"
13319,"Just hanging out.
"
13320,"Talking about web sites.
"
13321,"We saw this interesting web site
"
13322,"about marriage.
"
13323,"How unnecessary it is.
"
13324,"How it's a way for governments
"
13325,"to keep tabs on you.
"
13326,"Yeah, Big Brother.
"
13327,"That's a little crazy.
"
13328,"Although I am glad you're looking
"
13329,"at other things on the lnternet.
"
13330,"Got me thinking,
"
13331,"why would anybody want to get married?
"
13332,"To celebrate the relationship.
"
13333,"To solidify the commitment.
"
13334,"To declare your love for one another
"
13335,"to the world.
"
13336,"Well, that's good to know.
"
13337,"The Mr. Bowmont's here!
"
13338,"A customer wants to compliment you.
"
13339,"Shall I let him in?
"
13340,"Sure! I love this part!
"
13341,"-Come on in.
"
13342,"-Hi.
"
13343,"I'm not here to compliment the chef.
"
13344,"I hate when people come back
"
13345,"to compliment the chef.
"
13346,"Like I've nothing better to do.
"
13347,"What's up?
"
13348,"It was great seeing you
"
13349,"the other night.
"
13350,"Good to see you too.
"
13351,"Came to tell me that?
"
13352,"No. Came here to tell you
"
13353,"something else.
"
13354,"Came here to tell you
"
13355,"I still love you.

"
13360,"be here telling you this.
"
13361,"You're with Chandler,
"
13362,"who I really like.
"
13363,"You say he's straight,
"
13364,"I'll believe you.
"
13365,"After seeing you, I knew if I didn't
"
13366,"tell you I'd always regret it.
"
13367,"Letting you go was
"
13368,"the stupidest thing I ever did.
"
13369,"You're really not
"
13370,"supposed to be back here.
"
13371,"I'm sorry. I know this is
"
13372,"the wrong time and the wrong place. . .
"

"
13374,"I want to spend my life with you

"
13376,"I want to have kids with you.
"

"
13378,"I know this is crazy,

"
13380,"Yes, you're too late.
"
13381,"Where was all this three years ago?
"
13382,"I know. I was an idiot.
"
13383,"And I tried to forget you.
"
13384,"I really did.
"
13385,"After we had lunch last year, I spent
"
13386,"six months in Africa trying to forget.
"
13387,"-What were you doing in Africa?

"
13395,"Only if you tell me Chandler's
"

"
13397,"Well, he is. I mean. . .
"
13398,". . .marriage is all he talks about.
"

"
13410,"I know. They'll be so happy together.
"

"
13412,"How often does that happen?
"
13413,"-Not that often.
"

"

"
13418,"Oh, no! God, definitely not jealous.
"
13419,"I'm probably 98% happy

"

"

"
13430,"you were saying yesterday?
"
13431,"-You don't really believe that.
"
13432,"-Sure, I do.
"
13433,"In fact, I think the whole concept
"
13434,"of marriage is unnatural.
"
13435,"Look at pigs. Let's take
"

"
13437,"Pigs don't mate for life.
"

"
13442,"Wait a minute.
"
13443,"Are you telling me
"
13444,"you may never want to get married?
"
13445,"Never say never, but, probably. . .
"

"

"

"

"

"
13462,"-Would be nice to have a guarantee.
"
13463,"-What do you mean?
"
13464,"Some people make deals with a friend.
"
13465,"Like if neither of them are married
"
13466,"by 40, they marry each other.
"
13467,"-You mean a backup?
"
13468,"-Exactly.
"
13469,"I've got that.
"
13470,"You do?
"
13471,"-Who?
"
13472,"-Joey?
"
13473,"Joey? Are you serious?
"
13474,"I locked him in years ago.
"
13475,"Wait. So if neither of you are
"
13476,"married by 40, you'll marry Joey?
"
13477,"Yep. We shook on it.
"
13478,"But believe me, that is not
"
13479,"how he wanted to seal the deal.
"
13480,"Seriously?
"
13481,"I think his exact words were. . . .
"
13482,"Charming.
"
13483,"He's just a backup.
"

"
13485,"Have you seen Rachel?
"
13486,"Or a mirror?
"
13487,"It's for my boat. Cool, huh?
"
13488,"Yeah, it's great.
"
13489,"What's the matter?
"
13490,"Talk to the captain.
"
13491,"Just realizing
"
13492,"I'm in a dead-end relationship.
"
13493,"He's giving you a hard time?
"
13494,"I don't want to get married tomorrow.
"
13495,"But I want to believe. . .
"
13496,". . .we're going somewhere,
"
13497,"that I'm not wasting my time.
"
13498,"-You know Chandler.
"
13499,"-No, I don't know Chandler.
"
13500,"Not anymore.
"
13501,"It's like something's changed.
"
13502,"Maybe you changed.
"
13503,"I didn't change.
"
13504,"Maybe that's the problem.
"
13505,"-What?
"
13506,"-Chandler is a complex fellow.
"
13507,"One who is unlikely to take a wife.
"
13508,"Does he think I'll just
"
13509,"wait around for nothing?
"
13510,"Face it.
"
13511,"Chandler is against marriage.
"
13512,"And always will be.
"
13513,"Well, there's some people
"
13514,"who do want to marry me.
"
13515,"-There are?
"
13516,"-Yeah. Richard.
"
13517,"Richard said he wants to marry you?
"
13518,"-And Chandler says he hates marriage?
"
13519,"-That's right.
"
13520,"Chandler loves marriage!
"
13521,"You just told me he hates marriage!
"
13522,"That he's a complex fellow
"
13523,"who's unlikely to take a wife!
"
13524,"That he's against marriage
"
13525,"and always will be!
"
13526,"You got that from what I said?
"
13527,"-Rach.
"
13528,"-Hey, you.
"
13529,"-Come on in.
"
13530,"-Thank you.
"
13531,"I'm so sorry
"
13532,"to hear about you and Elizabeth.
"
13533,"Thanks. Yeah, I really thought
"
13534,"we'd be able to make it work.
"
13535,"I guess it just wasn't meant to be.
"
13536,"Yeah. Love.
"
13537,"It's a tricky business, isn't it?
"
13538,"I guess so.
"
13539,"So what do you say we make a pact?
"
13540,"If you and I are both single by 40,
"
13541,"we get married.
"
13542,"I mean, we know each other,
"
13543,"we like each other. . .
"
13544,". . .we've already slept together,
"
13545,"so there'll be no surprises there.
"
13546,"No, like, ""What's that?""
"
13547,"-Oh, you want me to be your backup.
"
13548,"-Exactly.
"
13549,"Yeah. I already have one.
"
13550,"-Who?
"
13551,"-Phoebe.
"
13552,"Phoebe?
"
13553,"But she just said Joey is her backup.
"
13554,"Oh, I don't think so.
"
13555,"I just spoke with her. She said
"
13556,"that she and Joey made a deal.
"
13557,"That's impossible.
"
13558,"We have had a deal for years.
"
13559,"We shook on it.
"
13560,"Although, believe me,
"
13561,"she wanted to do a lot more than that.
"
13562,"Where have you been?
"
13563,"I was making a coconut phone
"
13564,"with the Professor.
"
13565,"Richard told Monica
"
13566,"he wants to marry her.
"
13567,"-What?
"
13568,"-I've been looking for you.
"
13569,"Stop messing with her!
"
13570,"And I would have if these damn
"
13571,"boat shoes wouldn't keep flying off!
"
13572,"-Oh, my God!
"
13573,"-I know! They suck!
"
13574,"He's not supposed to ask her
"
13575,"to marry him! I am!
"
13576,"-I know!
"
13577,"-What--?
"
13578,"You know what I'll do?
"
13579,"I'll go over there and kick his ass!
"
13580,"Will you help me?
"
13581,"Look, us getting our asses kicked
"
13582,"is not a solution.
"
13583,"-Look, just go and find Monica.
"
13584,"-You're right.
"
13585,"I'm gonna get the ring. . .
"
13586,". . .I'll go find her. . .
"
13587,". . .and I'll propose!
"
13588,"Dude! Dude! Dude!
"
13589,"That coconut phone
"
13590,"might be good for the boat.
"
13591,"Hi.
"
13592,"Hi.
"
13593,"I don't know why I'm here.
"
13594,"I didn't ask.
"
13595,"You want to come in?
"
13596,"I don't know.
"
13597,"Oh, okay.
"
13598,"I'll just leave the door open
"
13599,"and go sit on the couch.
"
13600,"Chandler is such an idiot!
"
13601,"Drink?
"
13602,"-Scotch on the--
"
13603,"-Rocks with a twist?
"
13604,"I remember.
"
13605,"You still smoking cigars?
"
13606,"No. That's art.
"
13607,"If it bothers you,
"
13608,"I can put my art out.
"
13609,"No, that's okay.
"
13610,"So, Monica. . .
"
13611,". . .Iet me ask you a question.
"
13612,"Since we broke up, do you ever. . .
"
13613,". . .think about me?
"
13614,"Actually, I thought about you
"
13615,"a couple months ago.
"
13616,"-Really?
"
13617,"-Yeah, but it's because l. . .
"
13618,". . .had an eye exam,
"
13619,"and I don't like my new eye doctor.
"
13620,"-Who is it?
"
13621,"-Edward Nevsky.
"
13622,"Yeah, he's no good.
"
13623,"Do you ever think about me in. . .
"
13624,". . .a non-eye-doctor way?
"
13625,"No.
"
13626,"Because getting over you was
"
13627,"the hardest thing I've ever had to do.
"
13628,"I never let myself think about you.
"
13629,"Phoebe, you picked Joey and Ross?
"
13630,"You can't have two backups!
"
13631,"Of course I can.
"
13632,"It's just good sense
"
13633,"to back up your backup.
"
13634,"-Look, I've already lost Chandler.
"
13635,"-What?
"
13636,"Hey, Phoebe!
"
13637,"We're both backups?
"
13638,"How could you do this to me?
"
13639,"What are you complaining about?
"
13640,"You were both aware of the situation.
"
13641,"-I was not!
"
13642,"-No, we weren't!
"
13643,"This kind of back talk
"
13644,"isn't gonna fly when we're married.
"
13645,"You can't have both. Pick one.
"
13646,"-Pick me!
"
13647,"-No, pick me!
"
13648,"I don't want to end up an old maid.
"
13649,"Well, let's see.
"
13650,"Ross is a good father.
"
13651,"But. . .
"
13652,". . .Joey has a boat. This is hard.
"
13653,"This is crazy.
"
13654,"I want to switch to Rachel.
"
13655,"I want to switch too.
"
13656,"No, wait!
"
13657,"Wait, guys.
"
13658,"Don't make any rash decisions.
"
13659,"Remember my promise:
"
13660,"If we get married,
"
13661,"three times a week.
"
13662,"Oh, my God. Phoebe. . . .
"
13663,"I'm talking about massages.
"
13664,"No, I'm not.
"
13665,"I know how to settle this.
"
13666,"Here's what we'll do.
"
13667,"I'll write ""Joey"" . . .
"
13668,". . .on one napkin.
"
13669,"And I'm going to write ""Ross""
"
13670,"on the other napkin. . .
"
13671,". . .and we'll pick one.
"
13672,"That person will be our backup.
"
13673,"Here we go.
"
13674,"-That sounds fair.
"
13675,"-All right.
"
13676,"Good. Switching them up.
"
13677,"-Pick one.
"
13678,"-Left.
"
13679,"-Thank you.
"
13680,"-You're welcome.
"
13681,"-Ross.
"
13682,"-Joey.
"
13683,"-We should just switch.
"
13684,"-Absolutely.
"
13685,"I miss this apartment.
"
13686,"Now, this is a grownup's apartment.
"
13687,"I should be with a grownup, you know?
"
13688,"You're saying you need to be
"
13689,"with someone more mature.
"
13690,"Maybe someone with. . .
"
13691,". . .a license to practice medicine.
"
13692,"Or a mustache.
"
13693,"Let's face it. I'm not a kid anymore.
"
13694,"I need to be with someone
"
13695,"who wants the same things.
"
13696,"Coming to my work and telling me
"
13697,"you love me, I want that!
"
13698,"Talking about pig sex over lunch,
"
13699,"I don't want that!
"
13700,"I think that's fair.
"
13701,"Fair? Please.
"
13702,"Don't even talk to me about fair.
"
13703,"Fair would've been you
"
13704,"wanting to marry me then.
"
13705,"Or Chandler wanting to marry me now.
"
13706,"Believe me, nothing about this
"
13707,"is fair. Nothing.
"
13708,"-Nothing! Nothing!
"
13709,"-It's okay.
"
13710,"Nothing.
"
13711,"I don't know.
"
13712,"I don't know.
"
13713,"I know.
"
13714,"I have to figure. . .
"
13715,". . .some stuff, before I can. . . .
"
13716,"I understand.
"
13717,"Take as much time as you want.
"
13718,"1 0, 20 minutes, if you need it.
"
13719,"I'll be here. Not smoking.
"
13720,"Where is she?
"
13721,"I'm not scared of you.
"
13722,"She's not here. And please come in.

"
13725,"Monica?
"
13726,"Okay, she was here. But she left.
"
13727,"Where did she go?
"
13728,"She said she had to think things over.
"
13729,"Oh, my God. I can't believe this.
"
13730,"I thought you were a good guy.
"
13731,"Look, nothing happened.
"
13732,"Nothing happened? Nothing?
"
13733,"You didn't tell her you love her?
"
13734,"Well, all right, one thing happened.
"
13735,"You know what you did?
"
13736,"My girlfriend is thinking things over.
"
13737,"You made my girlfriend think!
"
13738,"Well, I'm sorry.
"
13739,"What's to think about? I love her.
"
13740,"Well, apparently I'm willing
"
13741,"to offer her things that you are not.
"
13742,"I'm willing to offer her those things.
"
13743,"This was just a plan.
"
13744,"To throw her off so when I offered
"
13745,"all these things, she'd be surprised.
"
13746,"If it helps, it worked very well.
"
13747,"It was working till you showed up,
"
13748,"you big tree.
"
13749,"This isn't fair.
"
13750,"You had your chance with her,
"
13751,"and you blew it!
"
13752,"This is my chance
"
13753,"and I won't blow it. . .
"
13754,". . .because we are
"
13755,"meant for each other.
"
13756,"And this has all just been
"
13757,"one stupid mistake!
"
13758,"I was gonna propose tonight.
"
13759,"You were?
"
13760,"Yeah, I even. . .
"
13761,". . .got a ring.
"
13762,"Did you get a ring?
"
13763,"No, I don't have a ring.
"
13764,"You go get her.
"
13765,"And can I give you a piece of advice?
"
13766,"If you do get her. . .
"
13767,". . .don't let her go.
"
13768,"Trust me.
"
13769,"You know, Richard,
"
13770,"you are a good guy.
"
13771,"I know.
"
13772,"I hate that.
"
13773,"-I've gotta find Monica.
"
13774,"-She's gone.
"
13775,"-What?
"
13776,"-She had a bag and she left.
"
13777,"-What?
"
13778,"-She was crying.
"
13779,"She said you want different things
"
13780,"and she needs to think.
"
13781,"Why didn't you tell her it was a plan?
"
13782,"I did! I told her everything.
"
13783,"She wouldn't believe me.
"
13784,"Where did she go?
"
13785,"To her parents.
"
13786,"She said you shouldn't call.
"
13787,"But if I were you, I would.
"
13788,"Can't believe I ruined this.
"
13789,"I am so sorry, man.
"
13790,"You wanted it to be a surprise.
"
13791,"Oh, my God.
"
13792,"Chandler. . .

13793,". . .in all my life. . .
"

"

"
13799,"There's a reason why
"
13800,"girls don't do this!
"
13801,"I'll do it. I thought. . . .
"
13802,"Wait, I can do this.
"
13803,"I thought that it mattered. . .
"
13804,". . .what I said or where I said it.
"
13805,"Then I realized. . .
"
13806,". . .the only thing that matters
"
13807,"is that you. . .
"
13808,". . .you make me happier

"
13810,"And if you let me. . .

13813,"Monica. . .

13915,". . .and tonight biology failed me.
"
13916,"Check it out. I could play this
"
13917,"while the guests are coming in, okay.
"
13918,"First time I met Chandler
"
13919,"I thought he was gay
"
13920,"But here I am singing
"
13921,"On his wedding day
"
13922,"Phoebe, no.
"
13923,"If you'd let me finish, it goes on
"
13924,"to say that he's probably not gay.
"
13925,"You guys don't have this problem,
"
13926,"you're made of wood.
"
13927,"Hey, you look great.
"
13928,"Thanks.
"
13929,"You okay over there?
"
13930,"I don't know. You know?
"
13931,"I feel a little. . . .
"
13932,"You know what? Never mind.
"
13933,"I'll be fine.
"
13934,"Don't worry about it. You're probably
"
13935,"tired, you had a lot of champagne.
"
13936,"It happens to everybody.
"
13937,"-Happy Monica's Night.
"
13938,"-Well, thank you. You too.
"
13939,"Can you believe
"
13940,"they are actually getting married?
"
13941,"Well, sure,
"
13942,"but I get married all the time.
"
13943,"-You okay?
"
13944,"-Yeah, I guess.
"
13945,"Do you think we'll ever have that?
"
13946,"You mean ""we,"" you and me?
"
13947,"Oh, no, no, no.
"
13948,"""We,"" you with someone,
"
13949,"me with someone.
"
13950,"Good, you scared me a minute.
"
13951,"I know. Shake it off.
"
13952,"It's just because you and l,
"
13953,"we were like a nightmare.
"
13954,"-No, but there were some good times.
"
13955,"-Absolutely. Like there was. . . .
"
13956,"-Surely you can think of something.
"
13957,"-Just give me a minute.
"
13958,"Oh, well, yes.
"
13959,"I can think of one good thing.
"
13960,"You were always good at the. . .
"
13961,". . .stuff.
"
13962,"I was good at the stuff?
"
13963,"I really liked your hands.
"
13964,"My hands?
"
13965,"Way to go, guys.
"
13966,"You were really good at the stuff too.
"
13967,"Oh, I know.
"
13968,"Hey, you know what we never did?
"
13969,"Oh, no, not that.
"
13970,"We never had bonus night.
"
13971,"-A what?
"
13972,"-You know, bonus night.
"
13973,"Two people break up, but they
"
13974,"get back together for one night.
"
13975,"One night, just sex?
"
13976,"No strings attached?
"
13977,"Yeah, yeah, we never had that.
"
13978,"No.
"
13979,"Okay, this is getting a little crazy.
"
13980,"I'm sure it would be amazing. . .
"
13981,". . .but I really don't think
"
13982,"it would be a good idea.
"
13983,"I really. . .
"
13984,". . .really. . .
"
13985,". . .don't.
"
13986,"'Sup?
"
13987,"'Sup, dude?
"
13988,"Take whatever you want,
"
13989,"just don't hurt me.
"
13990,"You playing
"
13991,"a little PlayStation, huh?
"
13992,"That's whack.
"
13993,"PlayStation is whack.
"
13994,"'Sup with the whack PlayStation,
"
13995,"'sup?
"
13996,"Come on, am I 1 9 or what?
"
13997,"Yes, on a scale of one to ten, ten
"
13998,"being the dumbest a person can look. . .
"
13999,". . .you are definitely 1 9.
"
14000,"Come on, really. How old?
"
14001,"Young. You're a man-child, okay?
"
14002,"Now get changed, everybody's ready.
"
14003,"And please, please, keep my underwear.
"
14004,"Thanks.
"
14005,"You've had a lot of sex, right?
"
14006,"When, today?
"
14007,"Some, not a lot.
"
14008,"The reason I'm asking
"
14009,"is because I had kind of a--
"
14010,"I was unable to--
"
14011,"I really wanted to, but I couldn't--
"
14012,"There was an incident.
"
14013,"Don't worry about that, man.
"
14014,"That happens.
"
14015,"-It's happened to you?
"
14016,"-Yeah, once.
"
14017,"-Well, what'd you do?
"
14018,"-I did it anyway.
"
14019,"Phoebe, come on, let's go.
"
14020,"Come on.
"
14021,"Why aren't you dressed yet?
"
14022,"I wrote the best song
"
14023,"for your wedding.
"
14024,"Check this out.
"
14025,"If you get ready now, you can play.
"
14026,"-Really?!
"
14027,"-Yes.
"
14028,"That's so exciting! Thanks, Mon.
"
14029,"But if you touch my guitar again, I'll
"
14030,"have to pound on you a little bit.
"
14031,"Fair enough. Get ready.
"
14032,"I'll get everybody.
"
14033,"Finally we can start celebrating my--
"
14034,"I'm sorry, apparently I opened
"
14035,"the door to the past.
"
14036,"Okay, Monica, Mon.
"
14037,"Okay, what you just saw--
"
14038,"Can I ask you just a little question?
"
14039,"Why tonight?
"
14040,"I waited my whole life
"
14041,"to be engaged. . .
"
14042,". . .and unlike some,
"
14043,"I only plan on doing this once.
"
14044,"Maybe it's selfish, I'm sorry, but I
"
14045,"hoped tonight could just be about that.
"
14046,"But it is just about that.
"
14047,"Now it's about you
"
14048,"getting back together.
"
14049,"See, you kind of stole my thunder.
"
14050,"We did not steal your thunder.
"
14051,"We are not getting back together.
"
14052,"Yeah, no, and you know what?
"
14053,"Nobody even saw.
"
14054,"That's true.
"
14055,"-We just kissed.
"
14056,"-It was just a kiss.
"
14057,"You guys kissed?!
"
14058,"What does this mean?!
"
14059,"Are you back together?
"
14060,"Can I sing at your wedding?
"
14061,"Thunder being stolen.
"
14062,"-Phoebe, it's nothing.
"
14063,"-Let's not make a big deal of this.
"
14064,"It was a one-time thing.
"
14065,"It doesn't even matter.
"
14066,"Oh, my God.
"
14067,"I cannot believe you guys
"
14068,"are talking about this.
"
14069,"Problems in the bedroom
"
14070,"are between a man and woman.
"
14071,"All right? Now, Chandler
"
14072,"is doing the best he can.
"
14073,"I don't think that's
"
14074,"what they were talking about.
"
14075,"What a great night.
"
14076,"Chandler can't do it, they kissed.
"
14077,"-What?
"
14078,"-You guys kissed? This is huge.
"
14079,"No, it's not huge.
"
14080,"People thinking it's huge
"
14081,"has led Monica to believe. . .
"
14082,". . .we're stealing her thunder,
"
14083,"which we aren't.
"
14084,"We're still talking about it.
"
14085,"That, and Chandler's problem.
"
14086,"Monica, listen, listen.
"
14087,"Would you feel better if we stopped
"
14088,"talking about Ross and Rachel?
"
14089,"-That would be lovely.
"
14090,"-You got it.
"
14091,"Now, I can pass for 1 9, right?
"
14092,"Yes, you can pass for 1 9.
"
14093,"-Really?
"
14094,"-Yes.
"
14095,"-Seriously?
"
14096,"-Seriously?
"
14097,"Seriously, no. Okay? You can play
"
14098,"your own age, which is 31 .
"
14099,"I'm 30!
"
14100,"Joey, you are not. You're 31 .
"
14101,"Oh, crap!
"
14102,"So, the Plaza. We'll get some mai
"
14103,"tais? Maybe no more for you though.
"
14104,"You know, I think I don't feel like
"
14105,"going to the Plaza.
"
14106,"Monica, this is ridiculous.
"
14107,"I don't want to talk about it.
"
14108,"I don't. Especially with you.
"
14109,"That is whack.
"
14110,"I'll play it at the wedding.
"
14111,"We'll see if they actually
"
14112,"let you play.
"
14113,"They tell you anything
"
14114,"you want to hear. . .
"
14115,". . .Iike, ""You look 1 9. ""
"
14116,"Then they just take it away,
"
14117,"like, ""No, you don't. ""
"
14118,"Monica won't take this away.
"
14119,"-Wouldn't she?
"
14120,"-Would she?
"
14121,"Would she?
"
14122,"You ate my candy bar!
"
14123,"Guess who.
"
14124,"Hey, I just realized we kind of left
"
14125,"some stuff up in the air.
"
14126,"What did Monica mean:
"
14127,"""I don't want to talk,""
"
14128,"especially with me?
"
14129,"Why not especially you and me?
"
14130,"We were both kissing.
"
14131,"Still thinking about it?
"
14132,"I'm serious. What did she mean
"
14133,"by that? ""Especially you. ""
"
14134,"-Who cares?
"
14135,"-I care.
"
14136,"And so do l.
"
14137,"I have to talk to her.
"
14138,"Will you let me get changed?
"
14139,"Am I going to let you watch me?
"
14140,"No.
"
14141,"I can't believe her.
"
14142,"It's just so typical.
"
14143,"I know you're upset, but don't forget
"
14144,"there is going to be a wedding.
"
14145,"You are going to throw the bouquet,
"
14146,"and then a honeymoon.
"
14147,"-Maybe in Paris.
"
14148,"-Paris?
"
14149,"We will take a moonlit walk
"
14150,"on the Rue de la blah-blah-blah.
"
14151,"Keep talking.
"
14152,"We will sprinkle rose petals
"
14153,"on the bed and make love. . .
"
14154,". . .not just because it's romantic,
"
14155,"but because I can.
"
14156,"I love you.
"
14157,"Don't say anything,
"
14158,"you might scare it away.
"
14159,"It's Paris.
"
14160,"Who knows we're here?
"
14161,"Hi, Pheebs. What's up?
"
14162,"You said I could sing at your wedding,
"
14163,"so I need a small deposit.
"
14164,"You know, some good-faith money
"
14165,"to hold the date.
"
14166,"We're not giving you a deposit
"
14167,"for our wedding.
"
14168,"Oh, I see.
"
14169,"They break your heart, don't they?
"
14170,"You know, I don't really need
"
14171,"their permission.
"
14172,"You want to sing at their wedding,
"
14173,"sing at their wedding.
"
14174,"Yeah, and if you want to look 1 9,
"
14175,"then you--
"
14176,"You got to do something
"
14177,"about your eyes.
"
14178,"What's wrong with my eyes?
"
14179,"They give you away.
"
14180,"There's too much wisdom in there.
"
14181,"Put some tea bags on them
"
14182,"for 1 5 minutes.
"
14183,"-That'll get rid of my wisdom?
"
14184,"-Maybe 1 0 minutes for you.
"
14185,"Give her the deposit, give her
"
14186,"the ring. I don't care.
"
14187,"What did you mean
"
14188,"when you said. . .
"
14189,". . .you didn't want to talk to anyone,
"
14190,"especially me?
"
14191,"What a great apology.
"
14192,"And you accept it. Bye-bye.
"
14193,"No, seriously, what was
"
14194,"the ""especially me"" part about?
"
14195,"Let's just say it's not the first time
"
14196,"you've stolen my thunder.
"
14197,"Hey, here's a thought. . . .
"
14198,"Monica, what are you talking about?
"
14199,"My sweet 1 6. You went to third base
"
14200,"with my cousin Charlie.
"
14201,"Third base.
"
14202,"It was all everybody could talk about.
"
14203,"The only reason I did that
"
14204,"was because your party was so boring.
"
14205,"We had a caricaturist.
"
14206,"Whenever I get married
"
14207,"Guess who won 't be asked to sing
"
14208,"Somebody named Geller
"
14209,"And somebody else named Bing
"
14210,"Monica, your sweet 1 6
"
14211,"was like a million years ago.
"
14212,"Yet here you are doing it again.
"
14213,"I don't want
"
14214,"to steal your stupid thunder.
"
14215,"Why else would you have
"
14216,"made out with Ross?
"
14217,"Got me.
"
14218,"Easy, mimey, the moment has passed.
"
14219,"It ain't gonna happen.
"
14220,"It'd be nice if I could
"
14221,"have this night.
"
14222,"I never wanted any part of your night.
"
14223,"No one was supposed to see us.
"
14224,"Is that why you did it in the secret
"
14225,"hallway, where nobody ever goes?
"
14226,"Rachel, I've been thinking.
"
14227,"I don't think us getting together
"
14228,"tonight is such a good idea.
"
14229,"I'm calling it off.
"
14230,"Way to save your dignity, my man.
"
14231,"Mon, why, why would I ever want
"
14232,"to take away from your night?
"
14233,"I don't know, maybe you feel
"
14234,"a little resentful.
"
14235,"Maybe you thought
"
14236,"you'd get married first.
"
14237,"Maybe you can't stand. . .
"
14238,". . .that your formerly fat friend
"
14239,"is getting married first.
"
14240,"Oh, wow, that-- You know what?
"
14241,"That is so unfair.
"
14242,"Now I want to steal your thunder.
"
14243,"Come on, Ross. Let's go have sex!
"
14244,"I can't believe you're gonna have sex
"
14245,"on my engagement night.
"
14246,"Well, somebody should.
"
14247,"Look, if we're gonna do this--
"
14248,"We're not.
"
14249,"She's just gonna think we are.
"
14250,"I see, so everybody wins.
"
14251,"-Who is it?
"
14252,"-It's Monica, open up.
"
14253,"Okay, Ross, stop it.
"
14254,"Please, wait a minute.
"
14255,"Yeah, you like that, baby?
"
14256,"May we help you?
"
14257,"I wanted to say I hope you have sex,
"
14258,"and I hope you get back together.
"
14259,"I warn you, the night
"
14260,"you announce your engagement. . .
"
14261,". . .I'm going to announce
"
14262,"that I'm pregnant.
"
14263,"How is that ever going to happen?
"
14264,"Do you want to know why
"
14265,"I was with Ross tonight?
"
14266,"-I know why.
"
14267,"-You don't.
"
14268,"-Okay, why?
"
14269,"-Because I was sad.
"
14270,"What do you mean?
"
14271,"Look, I am so. . .
"
14272,". . .so happy for you guys.
"
14273,"But you getting married reminds me
"
14274,"of the fact that I'm not.
"
14275,"I'm not even close.
"
14276,"Maybe I just wanted
"
14277,"to make myself feel better.
"
14278,"I know that that's dumb,
"
14279,"but you were so depressed. . .
"
14280,". . .when Ross got married,
"
14281,"you slept with Chandler.
"
14282,"I don't care, she slept with me.
"
14283,"Anyway, sweetie,
"
14284,"I am so sorry I ruined your night.
"
14285,"I'm sorry I almost made you
"
14286,"sleep with Ross.
"
14287,"I'm gonna take off.
"
14288,"-Congratulations, man.
"
14289,"-Thanks.
"
14290,"And Rachel. . .
"
14291,". . .what can I say?
"
14292,"You missed your chance.
"
14293,"From now on, the only person who's
"
14294,"going to enjoy these bad boys is me.
"
14295,"We thought Phoebe would leave
"
14296,"But she just stayed and stayed
"
14297,"That's right, I'm here all night
"
14298,"And Chandler will never get--
"
14299,"Hey, here's a dollar.
"
14300,"Consider it a deposit.
"

14346,"Oh, my God. Of course.
"
14347,"Would you please excuse me
"
14348,"for a moment?
"
14349,"Do you know each other's hometowns?
"
14350,"Why don't you. . .?
"
14351,"What's going on?
"
14352,"Well, not much. I was just thinking
"
14353,"that since they just got engaged. . .
"
14354,". . .it would be nice
"
14355,"if they have privacy.
"
14356,"So could I just move in with you
"
14357,"for a couple days?
"
14358,"Okay, sure. But what's wrong
"
14359,"with Monica and Chandler?
"
14360,"Nothing. Why?
"
14361,"Phoebe, you said it was urgent.
"
14362,"Yeah, it is. My movie starts
"
14363,"in five minutes.
"
14364,"Do you realize I have a classroom
"
14365,"full of students?
"
14366,"Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so rude.
"
14367,"Does anyone want to come to the movie?
"
14368,"I haven't cleared the
"
14369,"budget with my parents. . .
"
14370,". . .but tell me how this is for music.
"
14371,"A string quartet for the processional,
"
14372,"a jazz trio for cocktails. . .
"
14373,". . .the Bay City Rollers
"
14374,"for dancing. . . .
"
14375,"Wait, that was
"
14376,"for my 6th grade wedding.
"
14377,"You couldn't get them anyway.
"
14378,"Ian doesn't play anymore, and Derek. . . .
"
14379,"Derek is a name I shouldn't know.
"
14380,"Mon, do you have another pillow,
"
14381,"something a little snugglier?
"
14382,"Why are you napping here
"
14383,"instead of at your place?
"
14384,"-The duck.
"
14385,"-What, the duck?
"
14386,"What the hell
"
14387,"did the damn duck do now?
"
14388,"Well, he did not get sick
"
14389,"somewhere in there. . .
"
14390,". . .and it was immediately found
"
14391,"and properly cleaned up.
"
14392,"Do I get to look at this book. . .
"
14393,". . .or is it just for people
"
14394,"involved in the wedding?
"
14395,"Of course you can look at it.
"
14396,"I want your opinion.
"
14397,"Here you go.
"
14398,"-What about centerpieces?
"
14399,"-Centerpieces!
"
14400,"-Roses or lilies?
"
14401,"-Definitely roses.
"
14402,"I think they're more ""wedding-y. ""
"
14403,"-But lilies are the clear choice.
"
14404,"-Oh, my God, it's like one mind.
"
14405,"Guys, guys, you gotta let me nap.
"
14406,"I'm gonna get cranky.
"
14407,"Joey, there's a perfectly good couch
"
14408,"across the hall.
"
14409,"Yes, it is perfectly good. . .
"
14410,". . .and it is not one of the places
"
14411,"the duck got sick.
"
14412,"What?
"
14413,"-All right, I'm gonna go.
"
14414,"-Joey, what did the duck do?
"
14415,"I don't know,
"
14416,"but he did not eat your face cream.
"
14417,"Hey, little buddy. How you feeling?
"
14418,"What the hell is in that face cream?
"
14419,"That's so soft.
"
14420,"Pillowcases!
"
14421,"""Zelda looked at the chimney sweep.
"
14422,"Her father, the vicar--""
"
14423,"Vicar?
"
14424,"""--wouldn 't be home for hours.
"
14425,"Her loins were burning.
"
14426,"She threw caution to the wind
"
14427,"and reached out and grabbed his--""
"
14428,"This is a dirty book!
"
14429,"Phoebe?
"
14430,"Oh, Ross, hi.
"
14431,"-Phoebe, what are you doing?
"
14432,"-Sorry, I'm with a client right now.
"
14433,"-Phoebe!
"
14434,"-Okay, let's talk outside.
"
14435,"Phoebe, you can't massage people
"
14436,"in my apartment.
"
14437,"I did it at Monica and Chandler's.
"
14438,"And they knew about it?
"
14439,"Okay, Ross, what is this really about?
"
14440,"This is my home, and I want to be
"
14441,"able to come and go when I want.
"
14442,"I will find someplace else
"
14443,"to do the rest of my appointments.
"
14444,"I don't know what the big deal is.
"
14445,"I don't want naked,
"
14446,"greasy strangers in my apartment. . .
"
14447,". . .when I want to kick back
"
14448,"with a puzzle-- Beer, cold beer.
"
14449,"Hey, Joey. What are you doing?
"
14450,"Sweeping. Why?
"
14451,"Does it turn you on?
"
14452,"No.
"
14453,"What if I was sweeping a chimney?
"
14454,"Joey, did you eat my face cream?
"
14455,"Where are you going?
"
14456,"The vicar won't be home for hours.
"
14457,"Joey, where did you learn that word?
"
14458,"Where do you think. . .
"
14459,". . .Zelda?
"
14460,"-You found my book?!
"
14461,"-Yeah, I did!
"
14462,"Joey, what are you doing
"
14463,"going into my bedroom?
"
14464,"I'm sorry. I know I shouldn't have,
"
14465,"but you got porn!
"
14466,"You know what? I don't care.
"
14467,"I'm not ashamed of my book.
"
14468,"There's nothing wrong with a woman
"
14469,"enjoying a little erotica.
"
14470,"It's a healthy expression
"
14471,"of female sexuality. . .
"
14472,". . .which, by the way, is something
"
14473,"that you will never understand.
"
14474,"You got porn.
"
14475,"-Hello.
"
14476,"-Hi, is Phoebe here?
"
14477,"-No, she's out for the night.
"
14478,"-Oh, great!
"
14479,"Can I help you with something?
"
14480,"I don't know. Are you a masseur?
"
14481,"Yes, I am.
"
14482,"Great! Dad?
"
14483,"Thank you so much.
"
14484,"I'll pick him up in an hour.
"
14485,"Your parents must've been thrilled
"
14486,"when you told them you were engaged.
"
14487,"Oh, yeah.
"
14488,"I should probably call them.
"
14489,"I remember when we first got engaged.
"
14490,"-I've never heard that story.
"
14491,"-Dad, you don't--
"
14492,"Well, I'd gotten Judy pregnant.
"
14493,"I still don't know how.
"
14494,"You don't know how? Your dog
"
14495,"thought my diaphragm was a chew toy.
"
14496,"What a sweet story.
"
14497,"At least you're not hearing it
"
14498,"at your 5th grade Halloween party.
"
14499,"They wanted a scary story.
"
14500,"We're really excited
"
14501,"about our wedding plans.
"
14502,"Pretty soon we'll be making a big
"
14503,"withdrawal from the wedding fund.
"
14504,"-What?
"
14505,"-You tell her, Jack. I can't do it.
"
14506,"You have the wedding fund, don't you?
"
14507,"We have it.
"
14508,"Only now we call it ""the beach house. ""
"
14509,"You spent my wedding
"
14510,"fund on the beach house?
"
14511,"We're sorry. We assumed. . .
"
14512,". . .that when you turned 30
"
14513,"you'd pay for it yourself.
"
14514,"You bought the beach house
"
14515,"when I was 23.
"
14516,"So you've had seven years
"
14517,"of beach fun. . .
"
14518,". . .and you can't put a price on that.
"
14519,"We do feel bad about this.
"
14520,"We saved again
"
14521,"when you dated Richard.
"
14522,"Then that went to hell,
"
14523,"so we redid the kitchen.
"
14524,"What about Chandler?
"
14525,"It was Chandler.
"
14526,"We didn't think he'd propose.
"
14527,"I didn't start drinking
"
14528,"enough at the start of the meal.
"
14529,"I can't believe there's no money
"
14530,"for my wedding.
"
14531,"Maybe, if your father hadn't tried. . .
"
14532,". . .to sell ice over the lnternet.
"
14533,"-It seemed like such a simple idea.
"
14534,"-Stupid. The word is ""stupid. ""
"
14535,"Enough. I don't want
"
14536,"to hear about it anymore.
"
14537,"Good luck, Chandler.
"
14538,"Okay, now I'm going to. . .
"
14539,". . .touch you.
"
14540,"That's soft.
"
14541,"Do you think your parents
"
14542,"could help pay for it?
"
14543,"I don't know.
"
14544,"My mother spent most of her money
"
14545,"on her fourth wedding.
"
14546,"Saving the rest for her divorce.
"
14547,"And any extra cash my father has,
"
14548,"he saves for his yearly trips to. . .
"
14549,". . .Dollywood.
"
14550,"-What happened at dinner?
"
14551,"-My parents spent the wedding fund.
"
14552,"My God, what did you order?
"
14553,"Wait, there's no money?
"
14554,"Well, this is terrible.
"
14555,"You guys will have to get
"
14556,"married in, like, a rec center.
"
14557,"-Honey, it's gonna be okay.
"
14558,"-No, it's not gonna be okay.
"
14559,"-No swing band, no lilies.
"
14560,"-It's gonna be okay.
"
14561,"I mean, you don't need to have this. . .
"
14562,". . .rustic ltalian feast.
"
14563,"You don't need this custom-made. . .
"
14564,". . .empire waist, duchess satin gown.
"
14565,"You can wear off-the-rack.
"
14566,"It's really gonna be okay.
"
14567,"The important thing is, we love each
"
14568,"other and we're gonna get married.
"
14569,"Do you even understand what
"
14570,"""off-the-rack"" means?
"
14571,"Why don't you pay for it yourself?
"
14572,"How? I don't have any money.
"
14573,"-I have some.
"
14574,"-How much?
"
14575,"Well, close to. . . .
"
14576,"-Are you kidding me?!
"
14577,"-How much?
"
14578,"-Enough for wedding scenario A.
"
14579,"-Really?
"
14580,"How great are you, you little saver!
"
14581,"This is exactly
"
14582,"the budget of my dream wedding.
"
14583,"You guys are so made for each other.
"
14584,"You're not suggesting we spend
"
14585,"all the money on the wedding?
"
14586,"Yeah.
"
14587,"Look, Mon, I've been saving this money
"
14588,"for six years. . .
"
14589,". . .and I have some of it earmarked
"
14590,"for the future, not just for a party.
"
14591,"Wow! Hello, Mr. Chandler.
"
14592,"Sweetie, this is the most special day
"
14593,"of our lives.
"
14594,"I realize that, honey, but I won't
"
14595,"spend all the money on one party.
"
14596,"Honey, I love you.
"
14597,"But if you call our wedding
"
14598,"a party one more time. . .
"
14599,". . .you may not get invited.
"
14600,"We can always earn more money.
"
14601,"We're only gonna get married once.
"
14602,"I understand, but I have to put
"
14603,"my foot down. The answer is no.
"
14604,"You're gonna have
"
14605,"to put your foot down?
"
14606,"Yes, I am.
"
14607,"Money and a firm hand.
"
14608,"Finally a Chandler
"
14609,"I can get onboard with.
"
14610,"CENTRAL
"
14611,"PERK
"
14612,"-Hey, Rach.
"
14613,"-Joey.
"
14614,"Hey, Rach, do you smell smoke?
"
14615,"I get it. Smoke, chimney,
"
14616,"chimney sweep. Very funny. Ha, ha.
"
14617,"No, no, I'm serious.
"
14618,"You don't smell it?
"
14619,"Something's on fire.
"
14620,"I don't smell anything.
"
14621,"You know what? It's probably
"
14622,"just your burning loins.
"
14623,"-Hey, what are you guys talking about?
"
14624,"-Nothing.
"
14625,"Damn, this coffee's cold.
"
14626,"Do you mind if I heat this
"
14627,"on your loins?
"
14628,"You know, I cannot believe
"
14629,"you told him. Joey. . . .
"
14630,"I guess you bought that book
"
14631,"after we broke up.
"
14632,"I did, because I wore out my first
"
14633,"copy when I was with you.
"
14634,"Oh, yeah?
"
14635,"Well, when we were going out,
"
14636,"I read tons of porno magazines.
"
14637,"'Sup?
"
14638,"Ross, how could you do that
"
14639,"to an old man?
"
14640,"Excuse me, ladies.
"
14641,"I'm sorry?
"
14642,"My massage client. Arthur.
"
14643,"His daughter said some guy
"
14644,"that worked for me. . .
"
14645,". . .gave him a really weird massage.
"
14646,"I gave him an extremely
"
14647,"professional massage.
"
14648,"He said you poked
"
14649,"at him with wooden spoons.
"
14650,"Okay, so it wasn't
"
14651,"a traditional massage.
"
14652,"But I did give him acupressure
"
14653,"with a pair of chopsticks. . .
"
14654,". . .and I gently exfoliated him
"
14655,"with a mop.
"
14656,"Well, he's never coming back.
"
14657,"You just cost me $80 a week.
"
14658,"This is your fault.
"
14659,"You didn't move his appointment.
"
14660,"Oh, it's my fault?
"
14661,"You didn't have to massage him.
"
14662,"You could've sent him away.
"
14663,"You could've not rolled Tonka trucks
"
14664,"up and down his back.
"
14665,"He said he liked that!
"
14666,"You're right, you're right.
"
14667,"I'm sorry.
"
14668,"Dude, what are you massaging
"
14669,"an old man for?
"
14670,"-His daughter was hot.
"
14671,"-Gotcha.
"
14672,"Listen. . .
"
14673,". . .I've been thinking.
"
14674,"It's not fair of me to ask you to
"
14675,"spend all your money on our wedding.
"
14676,"I mean, you work really hard for that.
"
14677,"-Well.
"
14678,"-Well, you work for that.
"
14679,"Look, I've thought about it too.
"
14680,"I'm sorry. I think we should spend
"
14681,"all the money on the wedding.
"
14682,"-You do?
"
14683,"-Yeah, I'm putting my foot down.
"
14684,"Look, when I proposed,
"
14685,"I told you. . .
"
14686,". . .that I would do anything
"
14687,"to make you happy.
"
14688,"And if having the perfect wedding
"
14689,"makes you happy. . .
"
14690,". . .then that's what we're gonna do.
"
14691,"You are so sweet.
"
14692,"What about the future and stuff?
"
14693,"Forget about the future and stuff.
"
14694,"So we only have two kids.
"
14695,"We'll pick our favorite and
"
14696,"that one will get to go to college.
"
14697,"-Have you thought about that?
"
14698,"-Yeah.
"
14699,"How many kids were we gonna have?
"
14700,"Four. A boy, twin girls
"
14701,"and another boy.
"
14702,"What else did you think about?
"
14703,"Well, stuff like where we'd live,
"
14704,"you know.
"
14705,"Like a small place outside the city. . .
"
14706,". . .where our kids could learn
"
14707,"to ride their bikes.
"
14708,"We could have a cat that had a bell
"
14709,"on its collar. . .
"
14710,". . .and we could hear it every time
"
14711,"it ran through the little kitty door.
"
14712,"We'd have an apartment over the garage
"
14713,"where Joey could grow old.
"
14714,"You know what?
"
14715,"I don't want a big, fancy wedding.
"
14716,"-Sure you do.
"
14717,"-No.
"
14718,"I want everything that you've
"
14719,"just said. I want a marriage.
"
14720,"You sure?
"
14721,"-I love you so much.
"
14722,"-I love you.
"
14723,"When you were talking
"
14724,"about our future, you said cat.
"
14725,"But you meant dog, right?
"
14726,"-Totally.
"
14727,"-Good.
"
14728,"Hello, Zelda.
"
14729,"-Who are you supposed to be?
"
14730,"-The vicar.
"
14731,"-Do you even know what a vicar is?
"
14732,"-Like a goalie, right?
"
14733,"Look, that's enough.
"
14734,"You make stupid jokes
"
14735,"and sleazy innuendoes. . .
"
14736,". . .and it's just not funny anymore.
"
14737,"I'm sorry. Rach, I'm sorry.
"
14738,"Maybe I could make it up to you
"
14739,"by taking you roughly in the barn.
"
14740,"All right, that's it.
"
14741,"You want to do it? Let's do it.
"
14742,"That's right.
"
14743,"I want to do it with you.
"
14744,"Been trying to fight it,
"
14745,"but you said all the right things.
"
14746,"I did?
"
14747,"Yeah, I been waiting for so long
"
14748,"to get on that body.
"
14749,"-This body?
"
14750,"-Yeah, that's right.
"
14751,"Come on, Joey, sex me up.
"
14752,"You're starting to sound like
"
14753,"the butcher's wife in chapter seven.
"
14754,"Come on, now. Don't keep me
"
14755,"waiting. Take your clothes off.
"
14756,"But I'd keep that helmet on,
"
14757,"because you're in for a rough ride.
"
14758,"I don't want to. I'm scared.

"
14773,"Didn't you have a pair?
"
14774,"They were really round and burgundy,
"
14775,"and they made you look kind of. . . .
"
14776,"-Feminine.
"
14777,"-Yes!
"
14778,"No.
"
14779,"I think the glasses look great.
"
14780,"You look sexy.
"
14781,"-Really?
"
14782,"-Yeah.
"
14783,"You didn't think I wore glasses?
"
14784,"Of course.

"
14788,"What do you want for
"
14789,"an engagement gift?
"
14790,"That's okay, we're not
"
14791,"having a party. . .
"
14792,". . .so you don't have to get us--
"
14793,"If someone wants to give us a present,
"
14794,"we can't deprive them of that joy.
"
14795,"You should get them a
"
14796,"little CD player.
"
14797,"I already have one.
"
14798,"Unless someone borrowed it and
"
14799,"left it at the gynecologist.
"
14800,"Yeah, and by ""someone""
"
14801,"she means Joey.
"
14802,"I know what I want!
"
14803,"-What we want, honey.
"
14804,"-No, you don't want this.
"
14805,"I want your grandmother's
"
14806,"cookie recipe.
"
14807,"You mean the chocolate chip
"
14808,"cookie recipe?
"
14809,"The one my grandma
"
14810,"made me swear on her deathbed. . .
"
14811,". . .that I would never
"
14812,"let out of our family?
"
14813,"Dying people say the craziest things.
"
14814,"I've wanted it for years. I was gonna
"
14815,"make cookies for my children.
"
14816,"Break my heart. Oh, all right.
"
14817,"I'll be the mom who makes the
"
14818,"world's best chocolate chip cookies.
"
14819,"Our kids are gonna be fat,
"
14820,"aren't they?
"
14821,"Ahoy!
"
14822,"-How's the boat?
"
14823,"-I'm getting into this sailing stuff.
"
14824,"You finally took it out of the marina?
"
14825,"Why would I do that?
"
14826,"It took three guys
"
14827,"to get the thing in there.
"
14828,"If you don't sail it,
"
14829,"what do you do on it?
"
14830,"It's a great place to just sit. . .
"
14831,". . .hang around, drink a few beers,
"
14832,"eat some chips.
"
14833,"It's good that you finally
"
14834,"have a place to do that.
"
14835,"I could teach you to sail if you want.
"
14836,"-You could?
"
14837,"-I've been sailing my whole life.
"
14838,"When I was 1 5, my dad
"
14839,"bought me my own boat.
"
14840,"-Your own boat?
"
14841,"-He was trying to cheer me up.
"
14842,"My pony was sick.
"
14843,"-You know what I was thinking?
"
14844,"-What?
"
14845,"Nothing, I just like to go like this.
"
14846,"-What are you doing tonight?
"
14847,"-Do you have a lecture?
"
14848,"-No, why?
"
14849,"-Then, free as a bird. What's up?
"
14850,"My dad wants to know if you want
"
14851,"to play racquetball.
"
14852,"Great! Dad must like you!
"
14853,"He doesn't ask just anyone to play.
"
14854,"He didn't ask for you.
"
14855,"He asked for ""Chauncey. ""
"
14856,"I assumed he meant you.
"
14857,"Did you correct him?
"
14858,"No, I thought it would be
"
14859,"more fun this way.
"
14860,"Cool! Maybe you could
"
14861,"do this every week.
"
14862,"Or you could sit on the porch. . .
"
14863,". . .and make sure no one
"
14864,"steals the trashcans.
"
14865,"He does that every week too.
"
14866,"Just so you know, you have to let
"
14867,"him win. He hates to lose.
"
14868,"Maybe I'll play with my left hand.
"
14869,"You're not a lefty?
"
14870,"Does anybody know me?
"
14871,"What's wrong?
"
14872,"I went to my old apartment
"
14873,"to get the cookie recipe. . .
"
14874,". . .and that stupid fire burned it up!
"
14875,"No! Why didn't you make a copy
"
14876,"and keep it in a fireproof box. . .
"
14877,". . .and keep it at least 1 00 yards
"
14878,"away from the original?
"
14879,"Because I'm normal.
"
14880,"That was the one legacy
"
14881,"my grandmother left me.
"
14882,"And I know you wanted it
"
14883,"as an engagement present.
"
14884,"We have to get you
"
14885,"an engagement present?
"
14886,"Don't worry about it.
"
14887,"No one got me an engagement present.
"
14888,"I don't have the recipe, but here.
"
14889,"I wish you health
"
14890,"and happiness.
"
14891,"An old cookie?
"
14892,"This is what happens when you
"
14893,"don't register for gifts.
"
14894,"I made a batch and froze it.
"
14895,"This is the only one left.
"
14896,"We can't accept this.
"
14897,"Why not?
"
14898,"Cause it's gross.
"
14899,"No, wait. I think I can figure out
"
14900,"the recipe from this cookie.
"
14901,"I do this at work all the time.
"
14902,"-Really?
"
14903,"-I think so!
"
14904,"Okay, Ross, we owe you a present.
"
14905,"Two! I've been engaged twice.
"
14906,"Look at this clown.
"
14907,"He thinks he can take up the
"
14908,"whole river.
"
14909,"Get out of the way, jackass!
"
14910,"Who names their boat
"
14911,"Coast Guard, anyway?
"
14912,"That is the Coast Guard.
"
14913,"What are they doing here?
"
14914,"The coast is all the way over there.
"
14915,"Joey, just ignore the boats.
"
14916,"-We're not finished with our lesson.
"
14917,"-All right.
"
14918,"I'm gonna go over the basic
"
14919,"points once more.
"
14920,"Come on, Rach. I got it, okay?
"
14921,"I want to go over there. . .
"
14922,". . .where that boatload of girls is.
"
14923,"Is that it? You want to give. . .
"
14924,". . .a shout to the hot chicas?
"
14925,"Okay, let's do that, Sailor Joe.
"
14926,"Quick question, though:
"
14927,"What's this called?
"
14928,"-Boat rope?
"
14929,"-Wrong!
"
14930,"How do you get the mainsail up?
"
14931,"Rub it?
"
14932,"No. What do you do if I say
"
14933,"we're coming about?
"
14934,"I say, ""Come again?""
"
14935,"I know this one. I know this one.
"
14936,"Time's up. Now you're dead.
"
14937,"And deaf!
"
14938,"You go on and make your little jokes.
"
14939,"If you don't know
"
14940,"what you're doing. . .
"
14941,". . .you will die.
"
14942,"Am I getting through to you?
"
14943,"-Yes.
"
14944,"-Don't just say yes.
"
14945,"This isn't a game.
"
14946,"You could get hurt out here!
"
14947,"Do you want to pay attention,
"
14948,"or do you want to die?
"
14949,"I want to make a
"
14950,"ship-to-shore call to Chandler.
"
14951,"-I definitely taste nutmeg.
"
14952,"-You do?
"
14953,"You don't? Well, that's
"
14954,"the difference. . .
"
14955,". . .between a
"
14956,"professional and a layman.
"
14957,"That and arrogance.
"
14958,"Hey.
"
14959,"Hey. How was sailing?
"
14960,"I don't want to talk about it.
"
14961,"You could've at least saved
"
14962,"me a cookie.
"
14963,"Women are mean!
"
14964,"I can't believe that.
"
14965,"Now the only thing left
"
14966,"of my grandmother's legacy is. . .
"
14967,". . .this crumb.
"
14968,"I wish you a long and happy marriage.
"
14969,"-Hey.
"
14970,"-How was it?
"
14971,"Well, I had a great time.
"
14972,"Chauncey on the other hand. . . .
"
14973,"I will tell the story.
"
14974,"It was going great.
"
14975,"I let him win, we were bonding. . .
"
14976,". . .he even said I could call him Dad.
"
14977,"And what did he ask you
"
14978,"not to call him?
"
14979,"""Daddy. ""
"
14980,"Look, here's the story.
"
14981,"We hadjust finished playing,
"
14982,"and we were gonna take a steam.
"
14983,"I walk into the room...
"
14984,"...and it's really steamy.
"
14985,"So I take off my glasses,
"
14986,"and that's when it happened.
"
14987,"Guys?
"
14988,"-Over here.
"
14989,"-Have a seat, son.
"
14990,"Hey!
"
14991,"-Oh, my God! I can't believe it.
"
14992,"-I know.
"
14993,"You gave my father a lap dance.
"
14994,"Why do they put
"
14995,"so much steam in there?
"
14996,"Because otherwise they'd
"
14997,"have to call it the ""room"" room.
"
14998,"Why?
"
14999,"Why did that have to happen?
"
15000,"Come on, it's not that big a deal.
"
15001,"Not that big a deal?
"
15002,"There was touching of things.
"
15003,"I know you wanted
"
15004,"to bond with my dad. . .
"
15005,". . .but did you have to bond
"
15006,"to that part?
"
15007,"I'm sure Dad doesn't care.
"
15008,"He probably thought it was funny.
"
15009,"He'll be telling this story for years.
"
15010,"I don't want him to tell
"
15011,"this story for years.
"
15012,"Oh, but he will.
"
15013,"He still tells the story about how
"
15014,"Monica tried to escape from fat camp.
"
15015,"I wasn't escaping.
"
15016,"Then how'd you get caught
"
15017,"in the barbed wire?
"
15018,"I was trying to help out a squirrel.
"
15019,"You were trying to eat it.
"
15020,"If that is your father calling
"
15021,"to tell this story. . .
"
15022,". . .then the marriage is off!
"
15023,"Come on. Hello.
"
15024,"I'm sorry, you have the wrong number.
"
15025,"I'll call you later, Dad.
"
15026,"I love you.
"
15027,"I'm off to see your dad.
"
15028,"Aren't you a little overdressed?
"
15029,"You better make sure
"
15030,"he tips you this time.
"
15031,"I figured I would try to convince
"
15032,"him not to tell the story anymore. . .
"
15033,". . .and I figured the best way
"
15034,"to do that was face to face.
"
15035,"And by ""face,"" I don't mean his lap.
"
15036,"And by ""face,"" I don't mean my ass.
"
15037,"Are you getting Monica and
"
15038,"Chandler a present?
"
15039,"I don't know. You know,
"
15040,"they didn't get us anything.
"
15041,"Thank you!
"
15042,"Hey.
"
15043,"Well, hello.
"
15044,"So when are we getting
"
15045,"back out on the water, matey?
"
15046,"I don't know the boat way
"
15047,"to say this, but, never.
"
15048,"Why not?
"
15049,"Because you're mean on the boat.
"
15050,"I was just trying to teach you.
"
15051,"Well, lesson learned.
"
15052,"Rachel is mean.
"
15053,"Yep, yep, yep.
"
15054,"I remember when she took me out
"
15055,"on her dad's boat.
"
15056,"She wouldn't let me help at all.
"
15057,"Excuse me, I wanted you to help.
"
15058,"But you couldn't move. . .
"
15059,". . .because you were wearing
"
15060,"three life jackets.
"
15061,"You have to respect the sea.
"
15062,"Joey, I'm sorry if you thought
"
15063,"that was mean.
"
15064,"But I tell you, that was not mean.
"
15065,"My father is mean. He used to always
"
15066,"yell at me on the boat.
"
15067,"It was horrible.
"
15068,"I was being a really good teacher.
"
15069,"Does a good teacher say,
"
15070,"""Put down the beer, pinhead! ""
"
15071,"Does a good student drink 7 beers
"
15072,"during his first lesson?
"
15073,"Six and a half.
"
15074,"You knocked the last
"
15075,"one out of my hand, remember?
"
15076,"I didn't want you to get hit
"
15077,"by the boom.
"
15078,"Well, it hit me anyway.
"
15079,"It would have hurt a lot less
"
15080,"if I had finished that last beer.
"
15081,"I'm sorry. I will try to tone it down
"
15082,"and stop yelling.
"
15083,"No bossing me around?
"
15084,"-I won't boss you around.
"
15085,"-And be nice?
"
15086,"-I'll be nice.
"
15087,"-You'll be topless?
"
15088,"-Joey!
"
15089,"-You want me to learn?
"
15090,"Here's batch 22.
"
15091,"Maybe these are like your grandma's.
"
15092,"This has a bit of orange peel,
"
15093,"but no nutmeg.
"
15094,"Let's give it a shot.
"
15095,"I haven't made so many cookies
"
15096,"since 9th grade.
"
15097,"What for, a bake sale?
"
15098,"No, just a Friday night.
"
15099,"These are pretty good.
"
15100,"Yeah, but not as good as batch 1 7.
"
15101,"Which one was that?
"
15102,"The ones we had after
"
15103,"you almost threw up.
"
15104,"Oh, yeah, batch 1 7 was good.
"
15105,"I did not like batch 1 6.
"
15106,"I'm okay.
"
15107,"Any more from the good batch?
"
15108,"We could work off those.
"
15109,"I think there's one left.
"
15110,"Batch 1 6.
"
15111,"Sixteen, people, get out of the way!
"
15112,"Okay, Joey. You're doing really good.
"
15113,"I just need you
"
15114,"to step to the portside.
"
15115,"Remember talking about the portside?
"
15116,"Oh, yeah.
"
15117,"No.
"
15118,"It's left, sweetie, but that's okay.
"
15119,"That's a tough one.
"
15120,"Why not just say left?
"
15121,"Okay, go to the left.
"
15122,"The left.
"
15123,"Just sit over there!
"
15124,"You're yelling again. See that?
"
15125,"Oh, no, no. Very quiet.
"
15126,"Said with love, no yelling.
"
15127,"You know what?
"
15128,"Since I'm here, I'm gonna have
"
15129,"a beer on the portside.
"
15130,"See what I did there?
"
15131,"We're luffing a little.
"
15132,"Can you tighten up the Cunningham?
"
15133,"You just said a bunch
"
15134,"of stuff I don't know.
"
15135,"Joey, come on!
"
15136,"We just went over this.
"
15137,"We did that when that bird. . .
"
15138,". . .flew over with the fish
"
15139,"in his mouth.
"
15140,"Did you see it? It was gross.
"
15141,"I did not see the bird or the fish!
"
15142,"I did not see the piece of
"
15143,"Styrofoam shaped like Mike Tyson!
"
15144,"I did not, because I was trying
"
15145,"to teach you how to sail a boat.
"
15146,"Which obviously is
"
15147,"an impossible thing to do.
"
15148,"You're yelling, and I don't
"
15149,"see you taking your top off.
"
15150,"I quit!
"
15151,"-What do you mean? You can't quit.
"
15152,"-Why not?
"
15153,"You're not finished! I won't have it.
"
15154,"Greenes do not quit.
"
15155,"Greenes?
"
15156,"I'm a Tribbiani. Tribbianis quit.
"
15157,"Oh, my God.
"
15158,"I just said, ""Greenes don't quit,""
"
15159,"didn't l?
"
15160,"Did I say, ""Greenes don't quit""?
"
15161,"Yes! And you're still yelling at me.
"
15162,"No, I'm not yelling at you.
"
15163,"I'm just yelling near you.
"
15164,"Oh, God, Joey. I'm my father.
"
15165,"Oh, my God. This is horrible.
"
15166,"I try so hard not to be my mother,
"
15167,"I didn't see this coming.
"
15168,"I'm so sorry.
"
15169,"I just wanted you to learn.
"
15170,"I did learn.
"
15171,"-Really?
"
15172,"-Yeah, come on.
"
15173,"It's okay.
"
15174,"I know what a mainsail is.
"
15175,"I know to duck when
"
15176,"the boom comes across.
"
15177,"-I know port is right.
"
15178,"-Left.
"
15179,"Damn it!
"
15180,"It would make my grandmother happy. . .
"
15181,". . .that we're trying
"
15182,"to figure out her recipe.
"
15183,"I bet she's looking up at us
"
15184,"and smiling right now.
"
15185,"Looking up?
"
15186,"She was really nice to me but
"
15187,"she's in hell for sure.
"
15188,"Well, I've tried everything.
"
15189,"I give up.
"
15190,"I'm not gonna be the mom. . .
"
15191,". . .who makes the world's
"
15192,"best cookies.
"
15193,"I do make the best
"
15194,"duck confit with broccoli raab.
"
15195,"Kids love that, right?
"
15196,"Isn't there any relative
"
15197,"that has the recipe?
"
15198,"What about your sister?
"
15199,"No. I made a promise to
"
15200,"myself that the next time. . .
"
15201,". . .I would talk to Ursula
"
15202,"is over my dead body.
"

"

"
15205,"That's the day you're gonna die?
"
15206,"I've got shuffleboard that day.
"
15207,"That's what you think.
"
15208,"What about friends of your grandma?
"
15209,"Wouldn't they have the recipe?
"
15210,"I may have relatives in France
"
15211,"who would know.
"
15212,"My grandmother said she got it from
"
15213,"her grandmother, ""Nestley Toulouse. ""
"
15214,"What was her name?
"
15215,"Nestley Toulouse.
"
15216,"Nestlï¿½ Tollhouse?
"
15217,"You Americans always butcher
"
15218,"the French language.
"
15219,"Phoebe, is this the recipe?
"
15220,"Yes!
"
15221,"Oh.
"
15222,"I cannot believe that I spent. . .
"
15223,". . .two days figuring out that recipe.
"
15224,"It was here the whole time!
"
15225,"I know! You see,
"
15226,"it is stuff like this. . .
"
15227,". . .which is why
"
15228,"you're burning in hell!
"
15229,"So you understand.
"
15230,"I'd feel better if you
"
15231,"didn't tell what happened.
"
15232,"I'm a little embarrassed about it.
"
15233,"I understand completely.
"
15234,"Nothing's scarier
"
15235,"than embarrassing yourself. . .
"
15236,". . .in front of your in-laws.
"
15237,"As a matter of fact, when I started
"
15238,"dating Judy, I was unemployed.
"
15239,"Her father asked me
"
15240,"what I did for a living.
"
15241,"I said I was a lawyer.
"
15242,"-What'd you do when they found out?
"
15243,"-They never did.
"
15244,"So if you ever see me giving them
"
15245,"legal advice, just nod along.
"
15246,"Shall we?
"
15247,"So, I guess we wear swimsuits in here.
"
15248,"Well, Joey, I hate to admit it. . .
"
15249,". . .your way of sailing
"
15250,"is a lot more fun.
"
15251,"Why don't you give a pull
"
15252,"on that rope?
"
15253,"We're not sailing.
"
15254,"-Just pull on it.
"
15255,"-All right.
"
15256,"Sandwiches!
"
15257,"What else?
"
15258,"Here you go.
"

"
15260,"-Oh, wow.
"

"
15262,"-Sorry.
"
15263,"Not like that. You're letting
"

"
15265,"Careful!

"

"
15355,"-That's right.
"
15356,"-This is all very impressive, Hilda.
"
15357,"I just have one last question for you.
"

"

"
15360,"-I've never interviewed anyone.

"

"

"

"
15376,"Really?
"
15377,"Okay, well, then, all right.
"
15378,"Well, just have a seat there.
"
15379,"So what's your name?
"

"
15381,"Uh-huh, go on.
"
15382,"That's it. That's my whole name.
"
15383,"That's your whole name.
"
15384,"Of course.
"
15385,"Okay, let's just have a look-see here.
"
15386,"I haven't worked in an office before.
"
15387,"I don't have much experience--
"
15388,"What are you talking about?
"
15389,"You got three years painting houses. . .
"
15390,". . .two whole summers
"
15391,"at TGI Friday's.
"
15392,"It's lame, I know.
"
15393,"But I'm a goal-oriented person,
"
15394,"eager to learn--
"
15395,"Just hold on a second, please.
"
15396,"It's for human resources. Everybody
"
15397,"has to. Would you stand up?
"
15398,"No, no, no.
"
15399,"Hey.
"
15400,"-Anyway, I should go.
"
15401,"-Okay. Bye.
"
15402,"-Hey, sweetie.
"
15403,"-Hi, sweetie.
"
15404,"What was with all the whispering?
"
15405,"I can't tell you. It's a secret.
"
15406,"Secret? Married people aren't
"
15407,"supposed to have secrets.
"
15408,"We love and respect
"
15409,"one another too much.
"
15410,"But still, no.
"
15411,"We should tell each other everything.
"
15412,"I don't have secrets from you.
"
15413,"Really? So tell me what happened
"
15414,"to Ross, junior year at Disneyland.
"
15415,"No, I can't do that.
"
15416,"I'll tell you what Phoebe said.
"
15417,"-Okay.
"
15418,"-Okay.
"
15419,"So Ross and I
"
15420,"are going to Disneyland.
"
15421,"We stop at this restaurant for tacos.
"
15422,"When I say restaurant, I mean a guy,
"
15423,"a hibachi, and the trunk of his car.
"
15424,"So Ross has about ten tacos.
"
15425,"Anyway, we're on Space Mountain
"
15426,"and Ross starts to feel a little iffy.
"
15427,"Oh, my God. He threw up?
"
15428,"No, he visited a town
"
15429,"a little south of throw up.
"
15430,"What was Phoebe's secret?
"
15431,"Nancy Thompson, from Phoebe's
"
15432,"old massage place, is getting fired.
"
15433,"That's it? I gave up my
"
15434,"Disneyland story for that?
"
15435,"That's right. You lose, sucker!
"
15436,"Please still marry me.
"
15437,"You have an assistant, right?
"
15438,"Did she call?
"
15439,"You told her I was sick, right?
"
15440,"Always tell her I am sick.
"
15441,"I don't know.
"
15442,"How do you decide who to hire?
"
15443,"I have it down to two people.
"
15444,"One has great references
"
15445,"and a lot of experience.
"
15446,"-And then, there's this guy.
"
15447,"-What about him?
"
15448,"I love him.
"
15449,"He's so pretty, I want to cry.
"
15450,"I don't know what to do.
"
15451,"Come on, you know what to do.
"
15452,"You hire the first one.
"
15453,"Don't hire assistants because they're
"
15454,"cute. Do it because they're qualified.
"
15455,"Uh-huh.
"
15456,"I hear you. You make a lot of sense.
"
15457,"Can I just say one more thing?
"
15458,"Look how pretty.
"
15459,"Let me see.
"
15460,"Oh, my God.
"
15461,"Oh. But, no.
"
15462,"No. You can't hire him
"
15463,"because it's not professional.
"
15464,"This is for me, yes?
"
15465,"Okay, you're right.
"
15466,"I'll hire Hilda tomorrow.
"
15467,"Dumb, old, perfect-for-the-job Hilda.
"
15468,"Let me see.
"
15469,"Wow!
"
15470,"Don't show this to Monica.
"
15471,"And don't tell her about the ""Wow! ""
"
15472,"-Hey, Joey.
"
15473,"-Hey, Terry.
"
15474,"-Nice to see you again.
"
15475,"-Been a while.
"
15476,"Funny, these halls look smaller
"
15477,"than they used to.
"
15478,"It's a different building.
"
15479,"So. . .
"
15480,". . .Stryker Ramoray, huh?
"
15481,"-When do I start?
"
15482,"-How about right now?
"
15483,"Okay.
"
15484,"Here are the audition scenes.
"
15485,"I thought you
"
15486,"were offering me the part.
"
15487,"Why?
"
15488,"I was Doctor Drake Ramoray,
"
15489,"Stryker's twin brother.
"
15490,"Who looks more like me than me, right?
"
15491,"Everybody has to audition.
"
15492,"You know, Terry,
"
15493,"I don't really need to do this.
"
15494,"I got my own cable TV series. . .
"
15495,". . .with a robot.
"
15496,"I'm sorry, Joey.
"
15497,"That's the way it is.
"
15498,"Well. . .
"
15499,". . .I guess you think
"
15500,"you're pretty special.
"
15501,"Sitting up here in your fancy,
"
15502,"small-halled building. . .
"
15503,". . .making stars jump
"
15504,"through hoops for you.
"
15505,"Well, you know what?
"
15506,"This is one star whose hoop--
"
15507,"This is the star the hoop--
"
15508,"This hoop--
"
15509,"I was Doctor Drake Ramoray!
"
15510,"Hi, Tag. What are you doing here?
"
15511,"I came to thank you for not laughing
"
15512,"in my face yesterday.
"
15513,"I noticed there were no plants
"
15514,"so I brought you your first.
"
15515,"There is a plant in your office.
"
15516,"Kind of.
"
15517,"Right.
"
15518,"So I guess I shouldn't put
"
15519,"""good at noticing stuff"" on my rï¿½sumï¿½.
"
15520,"-Thank you.
"
15521,"-Anyway. . .
"
15522,". . .I'm guessing you hired somebody.
"
15523,"Well. . . .
"
15524,"Gotcha.
"
15525,"Thanks again for meeting with me.
"
15526,"But I hired you.
"
15527,"-What?
"
15528,"-Yeah, you got the job.
"
15529,"-You're my new assistant.
"
15530,"-I am?
"
15531,"Yeah.
"
15532,"-I can't believe it.
"
15533,"-Me either.
"
15534,"First, I need you to go downstairs. . .
"
15535,". . .find a woman named Hilda,
"
15536,"and tell her to go home.
"
15537,"-Hey.
"
15538,"-Hey, good you're home.
"
15539,"Always nicer to hear than,
"
15540,"""Oh, crap, you again. ""
"
15541,"Hey, sweetie, I made you a surprise.
"
15542,"-Oh, yeah?
"
15543,"-Yeah, tacos.
"
15544,"Ever since that story,
"
15545,"I've had such a craving.
"
15546,"Did you not understand the story?
"
15547,"-Hey.
"
15548,"-Hey, what's up?
"
15549,"Nothing. Just figuring out
"
15550,"what to do for dinner.
"
15551,"Hey, what's that? Dinner stuff?
"
15552,"You making dinner?
"
15553,"No.
"
15554,"What's over there? Tacos?
"
15555,"No. No.
"
15556,"They're just ground beef smileys.
"
15557,"Those are tacos.
"
15558,"Excuse me, Mr. Mexico.
"
15559,"Either way, I'll pass.
"
15560,"Still can't eat those.
"
15561,"What's so funny?
"
15562,"I'm not laughing.
"
15563,"You told her!
"
15564,"Nancy Thompson's getting fired.
"
15565,"Okay, okay. I had food poisoning.
"
15566,"It's not like I chose to do it!
"
15567,"It's not like I said,
"
15568,"""What would make this ride more fun?""
"
15569,"Right. You're right, I'm sorry.
"
15570,"I shouldn't be laughing.
"
15571,"I should be
"
15572,"laying down papers for you.
"
15573,"-How could you?
"
15574,"-I had to. We're getting married.
"
15575,"Married couples can't keep secrets.
"
15576,"I guess Monica should know
"
15577,"about Atlantic City.
"
15578,"Dude!
"
15579,"-What happened?
"
15580,"-Chandler and I are in a bar. . .
"
15581,"Did you not hear me say, ""Dude""?
"
15582,". . .and this girl
"
15583,"is making eyes at Chandler.
"
15584,"So he goes over to her and, after
"
15585,"a minute or two, I see them kissing.
"
15586,"You're thinking he's not the type
"
15587,"to go to bars and make out with girls.
"
15588,"And you're right.
"
15589,"He's not the type. . .
"
15590,". . .to go to bars
"
15591,"and make out with girls.
"
15592,"You kissed a guy?
"
15593,"Oh, my God!
"
15594,"In my defense, it was dark
"
15595,"and he was a very pretty guy.
"
15596,"Oh, Mon, I laughed so hard--
"
15597,"So hard we had to throw out
"
15598,"your underwear again?
"
15599,"Whatever, dude. You kissed a guy.
"
15600,"-Hi.
"
15601,"-Hey.
"
15602,"How's Hilda working out?
"
15603,"Oh, my new assistant
"
15604,"is working out. Yes.
"
15605,"She happy she got the job?
"
15606,"My new assistant is very happy
"
15607,"that I hired my new assistant.
"
15608,"Hello.
"
15609,"Oh, hey! Can you hang on a second?
"
15610,"It's the producers at Mac and Cheese,
"
15611,"if you'll excuse me for a minute.
"
15612,"Hey, funny you should call. I was
"
15613,"just looking over next week's script.
"
15614,"Canceled!
"
15615,"Like, they're taking it off the air?
"
15616,"All right, I'll see you Monday.
"
15617,"We're not even shooting them anymore?
"
15618,"All right. Bye.
"
15619,"They canceled Mac and Cheese!
"
15620,"-Sorry.
"
15621,"-Sorry, Joey.
"
15622,"Why would they do that?
"
15623,"It was a good show, right?
"
15624,"You want to tell secrets?
"
15625,"Okay, in college. . .
"
15626,". . .Ross used to wear leg warmers.
"
15627,"All right, Chandler entered a Vanilla
"
15628,"lce look-alike contest and won.
"
15629,"Ross came in fourth and cried!
"
15630,"Oh, is that funny?
"
15631,"You find that funny?
"
15632,"Maybe Chandler should know
"
15633,"your secrets too.
"
15634,"I already told him everything.
"
15635,"You shush!
"
15636,"Once, she was sent to bed
"

"
15638,". . .so she ate the macaroni off
"
15639,"a jewelry box she'd made.
"
15640,"Ross stayed home every Saturday night
"
15641,"to watch Golden Girls.
"
15642,"Monica couldn't tell time
"
15643,"until she was 1 3.
"
15644,"It's hard for some people!
"
15645,"Of course it is.
"
15646,"Wow.
"
15647,"-Chandler wore my underwear to work!
"
15648,"-Hey!
"
15649,"I'm sorry, I couldn't think
"
15650,"of any more for Ross.
"
15651,"In college, Chandler got drunk. . .
"
15652,". . .and slept with the lady
"
15653,"who cleaned our dorm.
"
15654,"That was you.
"
15655,"Whatever, dude. You kissed a guy.
"
15656,"How could this happen to me?
"
15657,"Yesterday, I had two TV shows.
"
15658,"Today, I got nothing.
"
15659,"Wait a minute,
"
15660,"what happened to Days of our Lives?
"
15661,"Well, they might be a little mad
"
15662,"at me over there.
"
15663,"What happened?
"
15664,"Well, maybe I got a little upset, and
"
15665,"maybe I told them where they could go.
"
15666,"Joey, why would you do that?
"
15667,"Because! They wanted me to audition.
"
15668,"You, an actor? That's madness!
"
15669,"Rachel Green's office.

"
15671,"Hi, who was that?
"
15672,"Nobody. I was just practicing.

"
15675,"-Hi, Rachel Green's office.
"
15676,"You must be Hilda.
"
15677,"He's Tag. This is Phoebe.
"
15678,"Phoebe, can I see you for a sec?
"
15679,"Phoebe.
"
15680,"-Great name.
"
15681,"-You like that?
"
15682,"-You should hear my phone number.
"
15683,"-Okay.
"
15684,"So you hired yourself
"
15685,"a little treat, did you?
"
15686,"I know how it looks,
"
15687,"but I am telling you--
"
15688,"You can't get involved
"
15689,"with your assistant.
"
15690,"I know that, and I know hiring him was
"
15691,"not the smartest thing I've ever done.
"
15692,"But, from now on,
"
15693,"I swear this is strictly professional.
"
15694,"-Yes.
"
15695,"-Hey, Rachel.
"
15696,"Hi.
"
15697,"Cute assistant. What's his story?
"
15698,"-Is he--
"
15699,"-Gay? Yeah.
"
15700,"Hey, Terry.
"
15701,"Joey Tribbiani.
"
15702,"Surprised your big head

"
15704,"-I gotta go, Joey.
"
15705,"-Wait, Terry! Look.
"
15706,"I'm really sorry about before.
"
15707,"I was an idiot, thinking I'm too big
"
15708,"to audition for you.
"
15709,"-Give me another chance.
"
15710,"-I can't.
"
15711,"Wait, Terry, please!
"
15712,"Look, I just lost my other job, okay?
"
15713,"You have no idea how much I need this.
"
15714,"Please, help me out.
"
15715,"For old times' sake.
"
15716,"This guy's been in a coma
"
15717,"for five years. It's hopeless.
"
15718,"It's not. Dr. Stryker Ramoray
"
15719,"is a miracle worker.
"
15720,"Here he comes.
"
15721,"Good morning.
"
15722,"Drake, it's your brother, Stryker.
"
15723,"Can you hear me?
"
15724,"And cut.
"
15725,"I'm back, baby!
"
15726,"You know, in my defense. . .
"
15727,". . .there was no glitter on
"
15728,"the macaroni and very little glue.
"
15729,"And in my defense,
"
15730,"the cleaning lady came on to me.
"
15731,"-Do you have trouble telling time now?
"
15732,"-No.
"
15733,"-Quick, what time is it?
"
15734,"-Time to kiss a guy?
"
15735,"What are you laughing at, Pampers?
"
15736,"You know when I said
"
15737,"married people. . .
"
15738,". . .should share everything
"
15739,"and not have any secrets?
"
15740,"-Yeah?
"
15741,"-That was stupid. Let's not do that.
"
15742,"Absolutely.
"
15743,"We should keep the stuff we told
"
15744,"each other secret from everyone else.
"
15745,"Yeah, definitely.
"
15746,"Okay. If you'll excuse me. . .
"
15747,". . .I'm gonna hang out with people who
"
15748,"don't know the Space Mountain story.
"
15749,"-Then I'd steer clear of Phoebe.
"
15750,"-Man!
"
15751,"Not that you would, but I wouldn't
"
15752,"hang out with the guys at my office.
"
15753,"Hi.
"
15754,"-Do you have a minute?
"
15755,"-Sure. What's up?
"
15756,"I got asked out twice today
"
15757,"while I was at lunch. . .
"
15758,". . .by guys.
"
15759,"-Really?
"
15760,"-Yeah.
"
15761,"Did you tell someone that I was gay?
"
15762,"Oh, did you not want people
"
15763,"to know that?
"
15764,"I'm not gay. I especially wouldn't
"
15765,"want you to think I was gay.
"
15766,"Why is that?
"
15767,"-I don't think I should say.
"
15768,"-Oh, you can say.
"
15769,"Come on, I don't want you to feel
"
15770,"like you can't tell me things.
"
15771,"-Okay.
"
15772,"-Okay.
"
15773,"-Well. . .
"
15774,"-Yeah.
"
15775,". . .I'd love to ask out

"
15980,"Okay, don't freak out. I'll go.

15981,"It's my ex-wife, Whitney.

15984,"Okay, I know. Hold on.

"
15986,"-Yeah.
"

"
15988,"out there.
"
15989,"Do you think you could divert her
"
15990,"so we could slip out?
"
15991,"What? No.
"
15992,"Okay, but I have two tickets to
"
15993,"the ballroom-dance finals.
"
15994,"I don't think so, Pheebs.

"
16011,"-Are you ready for breakfast?
"
16012,"-Yep.
"
16013,"Kyle's ex-wife? You were supposed
"
16014,"to divert her, not date her.
"
16015,"Can you give me a second
"
16016,"while I talk to this woman. . .
"
16017,". . .who, by the way, did not
"
16018,"spend the night?
"
16019,"-Sure.
"
16020,"-Okay.
"
16021,"I did divert her, and we ended up
"
16022,"having a great time, okay?
"
16023,"Watching ballroom dancing?
"
16024,"Yes, that's where we realized
"
16025,"we were both super cool people.
"
16026,"Look, Kyle just told me
"
16027,"some really bad stuff about her.
"
16028,"Like what?
"
16029,"Like she's really mean, and
"
16030,"she's overly critical and--
"
16031,"She will paint a room a really bright
"
16032,"color without even checking with you.
"
16033,"Okay.
"
16034,"And she uses sex as a weapon.
"
16035,"Thank you for warning me.
"
16036,"At breakfast, I'll be on alert for
"
16037,"room painting and sex weapons.
"
16038,"-You're still gonna go out with her?
"
16039,"-Yeah.
"
16040,"Well, didn't you hear
"
16041,"what I just said?
"
16042,"Pheebs, come on.
"
16043,"I mean, consider the source.
"
16044,"Of course her ex-husband's gonna say
"
16045,"that stuff. Now if you'll excuse me.
"
16046,"Listen to me, she is crazy!
"
16047,"WHITNEY:
"
16048,"Your door isn't soundproof.

"
16051,"-Morning.
"
16052,"-Hi, Tag.
"
16053,"-Did you have fun with Joey?
"
16054,"-Yeah, we went to the Knicks game.
"
16055,"That's nice.
"
16056,"Then we went to a bar, and he
"
16057,"hooked us up with all these women.
"
16058,"Women? You mean, like old women?
"
16059,"Kind of old, like 30.
"
16060,"I never used to be able
"
16061,"to talk to girls in bars. . .
"
16062,". . .but I got like 20 phone numbers
"
16063,"last night.
"
16064,"That's great.
"
16065,"Joey must have really taught
"
16066,"you some stuff.
"
16067,"A little.
"
16068,"How you doing?
"
16069,"See? That's a great smile.
"
16070,"Easy, natural.
"
16071,"Now pretend I have a camera.
"
16072,"-You're changing it.
"
16073,"-I can't help it.
"
16074,"You want to know what I do
"
16075,"when I take rï¿½sumï¿½ shots?
"
16076,"Borrow money from me?
"
16077,"Yeah. Okay, first of all,
"
16078,"you want to make it look spontaneous.
"
16079,"So here's what I do. I look down,
"
16080,"look down, keep looking down.
"
16081,"Then I look up.
"
16082,"See? Now you try.
"
16083,"Look down. You're looking down.
"
16084,"Keep looking down.
"
16085,"Why is there jelly on your shoe?
"
16086,"I had a donut.
"
16087,"-Hi.
"
16088,"-Hey.
"
16089,"So, I heard you had some fun
"
16090,"with Tag last night.
"
16091,"Yeah, that guy's all right.
"
16092,"Yeah, and you had fun teaching him
"
16093,"how to be all ""Joey. ""
"
16094,"-What?
"
16095,"-You know, all the women.
"
16096,"You can't teach someone
"
16097,"to be good with women.
"
16098,"That's why I never had
"
16099,"any luck with Chandler.
"
16100,"I'm right here.
"
16101,"Would you mind just not
"
16102,"going out with him again?
"
16103,"Just the idea of you and he
"
16104,"and all these women--
"
16105,"I know he's my assistant,
"
16106,"and we can't date!
"
16107,"But it bothers me, all right?
"
16108,"No, no, no, you can't take him
"
16109,"away from me.
"
16110,"I got a great partner to pick
"
16111,"up girls with. Finally!
"
16112,"I'm still right here.
"
16113,"Will you talk to him. . .
"
16114,". . .and tell him how unsatisfying
"
16115,"this dating-tons-of-women thing is?
"
16116,"What?
"
16117,"I don't want him to meet anybody
"
16118,"until I'm over my crush.
"
16119,"I will get over it.
"
16120,"It's not like I love him.
"
16121,"It's just physical.
"
16122,"I get these crushes all the time.
"
16123,"I had a crush on you at first.
"
16124,"I know. Monica told me.
"
16125,"Did you have a crush on me
"
16126,"when we first met?
"
16127,"Yeah, sure.
"
16128,"Can you people not see me?
"
16129,"Will you talk to him?
"
16130,"-I don't know, Rach.
"
16131,"-I'll give you 1 0 Ralph Lauren shirts.
"
16132,"One.
"
16133,"No, 1 0. You said 1 0.
"
16134,"You can't take that back.
"
16135,"You wanted to talk to me?
"
16136,"I don't know.
"
16137,"You got something for me?
"
16138,"Yeah, this is from Rachel.
"
16139,"Ten. Okay.
"
16140,"Tag, there's such a thing
"
16141,"as too many women.
"
16142,"-Really?
"
16143,"-Yeah, for you.
"
16144,"-Hey, there you are.
"
16145,"-There I am.
"
16146,"-You okay?
"
16147,"-Yeah, Joey said I needed to relax.
"
16148,"So he gave me an antihistamine.
"
16149,"What?
"
16150,"I fell asleep on the subway
"
16151,"and went to Brooklyn.
"
16152,"Brooklyn is far.
"
16153,"What were you thinking?
"
16154,"But don't worry, because
"
16155,"I know how to take a picture now.
"
16156,"Okay, see. Look down.
"
16157,"Look down.
"
16158,"Look down.
"
16159,"-Chandler?
"
16160,"-Yeah?
"
16161,"-Hi.
"
16162,"-Hi.
"
16163,"How are things going with Crazy?
"
16164,"Has she cooked your rabbit yet?
"
16165,"Listen, you are hearing one side
"
16166,"of the story. Okay?
"
16167,"FYl, she must have shown Kyle
"
16168,"over 30 paint samples. . .
"
16169,". . .before she painted that room.
"
16170,"And his response to each one was,
"
16171,"""I don't give a tiny rat's ass. ""
"
16172,"Maybe she should have spent
"
16173,"a little less time decorating. . .
"
16174,". . .and a little more time
"
16175,"in the bedroom.
"
16176,"I don't think we are going
"
16177,"to have that problem. . .
"
16178,". . .but maybe it's because I am not
"
16179,"emotionally unavailable.
"
16180,"You think he's
"
16181,"emotionally unavailable?
"
16182,"I think he can be.
"
16183,"Maybe he wouldn't be. . .
"
16184,". . .if she didn't bring the office
"
16185,"home every night.
"
16186,"Excuse her for knowing
"
16187,"what she wants to do with her life.
"
16188,"Well, she certainly knew what
"
16189,"she was doing New Year's Eve 1 997.
"
16190,"I knew you were going
"
16191,"to throw that in my face!
"
16192,"That was three years ago.
"
16193,"She apologized and apologized.
"
16194,"What more do you want?!
"
16195,"We want the last 6 years back!
"
16196,"So do we! So do we!
"
16197,"I'm sorry you had to see that.
"
16198,"-Morning, Rachel.
"
16199,"-Hi.
"
16200,"Hey, so, what'd you do last night?
"
16201,"-Went out with Joey.
"
16202,"-Yeah?
"
16203,"Another night of bird-dogging
"
16204,"the chicas?
"
16205,"No, we had a really good talk.
"
16206,"I don't think I'll do
"
16207,"the bar scene anymore.
"
16208,"Wow, I did not see that coming.
"
16209,"It's just not really who I am.
"
16210,"I've always been happier when--
"
16211,"Why am I telling you this?
"
16212,"-You don't care about this stuff.
"
16213,"-Yes, I do.
"
16214,"You were saying,
"
16215,"""I'm happier when l. . . . ""
"
16216,"When I'm in a relationship.
"
16217,"-I love having a girlfriend.
"
16218,"-Really?
"
16219,"Someone I can spoil, you know.
"
16220,"Spoil?
"
16221,"-Let me ask you something.
"
16222,"-Uh-huh?
"
16223,"Do you believe there's one perfect
"
16224,"person for everyone?
"
16225,"I'm starting to.
"
16226,"And if that person's in your life
"
16227,"you should do something about it?
"
16228,"Yes. Hell, yes.
"
16229,"-All right, then, it's settled.
"
16230,"-Okay.
"
16231,"-I'm getting back together with my ex.
"
16232,"-I would love to!
"
16233,"What?
"
16234,"Hello?
"
16235,"Oh. This is gonna be a while.
"
16236,"Excuse me.
"
16237,"Yeah.
"

"
16239,"My God!
"

"
16241,"And speaking of being selfish in bed,
"
16242,"how's Whitney?
"
16243,"Maybe she wouldn't have to be
"
16244,"selfish in bed. . .
"
16245,". . .if someone else knew where
"
16246,"everything was.
"
16247,"Oh, he knows.
"
16248,"For the most part.
"
16249,"Oh, hey.
"
16250,"Good, you're both here.
"
16251,"We kind of need to talk.
"
16252,"-Both of you together?
"
16253,"-What's up?
"
16254,"Well, I went over to Kyle's last night
"
16255,"to pick up a few things. . .
"
16256,". . .and we got to reminiscing.
"
16257,"KYLE:
"
16258,"We talked most of the night. . .
"
16259,". . .and realized the reason
"
16260,"we're angry with each other. . .
"
16261,". . .is because there are still
"
16262,"feelings there.
"
16263,"So. . . .
"
16264,"Oh, just say it, Kyle!
"
16265,"We're gonna try again.
"
16266,"What about her whining,
"
16267,"and her constant need for attention?
"
16268,"I'll work on that.
"
16269,"Right, because you're so
"
16270,"capable of change.
"
16271,"You know, he hums when he pees.
"
16272,"-I do know.
"
16273,"-Makes him miss the bowl, but whatever.
"
16274,"We're so sorry.
"
16275,"That's all right. We don't need you.
"
16276,"I'm over it already.
"
16277,"Yeah, and I don't even give
"
16278,"a tiny rat's ass.
"
16279,"Yeah, we're gonna go.
"
16280,"I'm sorry.
"
16281,"Pheebs, you were right about her.
"
16282,"You know, she did try to use
"
16283,"sex as a weapon.
"
16284,"Yeah, I hurt my back a little.
"
16285,"You know, he hums while he does
"
16286,"other stuff too.
"
16287,"We're better off without them.
"
16288,"Even if they break up again, you better
"
16289,"not let him in your sad men's club.
"
16290,"-Divorced men's club.
"
16291,"-Po-tay-to, po-tah-to.
"
16292,"Hey, guys, check it out.
"
16293,"-My mom sent me the paper.
"
16294,"-Let's see it.
"
16295,"-Oh, yeah, that looks good.
"
16296,"-You make a very attractive couple.
"
16297,"-Yeah, we look great together.
"

"

16305,"The reason I asked you to brunch. . .

"
16308,"Oh, my God. This is it. Oh.
"
16309,"I hope it's you.

"
16315,"-Blah, blah, blah. Who is it?
"
16316,"I was thinking we could
"
16317,"come up with a system. . .
"
16318,". . .where we trade off
"
16319,"being maid of honor.
"
16320,"-Hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine--
"
16321,"-Yes! Oh.
"
16322,"Hypothetically.

"
16328,"-That's a pretty good idea.
"
16329,"-I'll do that. So, who's yours?
"
16330,"Well, that's the best part.
"
16331,"You guys get to decide.
"
16332,"-Why is that the best part?
"

"
16334,"Of course we'll help you decide.

"
16403,"I guess that was it.
"
16404,"Okay.

"
16414,"We fell asleep. That is all.
"
16415,"Yeah. Yeah? Yeah.
"
16416,"All right, well, I'd better go.
"
16417,"-I think that would be best.

"

"
16428,". . .and she wished me good luck.
"
16429,"That's sweet.
"
16430,"No, it was more like a ""good luck. ""
"
16431,"So, what did this woman look like?
"
16432,"She was, like, 30,
"
16433,"dark hair, attractive.
"
16434,"Any chance you were looking into a
"
16435,"bright, shiny thing called a mirror?
"
16436,"Was it someone you dated in college?
"
16437,"No, I only dated two girls
"
16438,"in college. . .
"
16439,". . .both blond, both not attractive.
"
16440,"Let me check this out.
"
16441,"-What are you doing?
"
16442,"-Well, let's see.
"
16443,"Okay, is that her?
"
16444,"Oh, my God, yes!
"
16445,"-Who is she?
"
16446,"-Julie Graff, my camp girlfriend.
"
16447,"Did you break up with her?
"
16448,"No, we're still together.
"
16449,"We went out for two summers
"
16450,"and then I broke up with her.
"
16451,"-Why?
"
16452,"-She came back the third summer. . .
"
16453,". . .and she'd gotten really fa--
"
16454,"-Fat?
"
16455,"-I did not say fat.
"
16456,"I said fa--
"
16457,"You broke up with a girl
"
16458,"because she was fat?
"
16459,"Yeah. Yeah.
"
16460,"But it was a really long time ago.
"
16461,"Does she still feel bad?
"
16462,"Apparently she does.
"
16463,"You know what they say:
"
16464,"""Elephants never forget. ""
"
16465,"Seriously, good luck marrying me.
"
16466,"Hey, what's going on?
"
16467,"She's Monica's maid of honor.
"
16468,"Hope it goes better than the last time
"
16469,"you did it for that girl downstairs.
"
16470,"You have been maid of honor before?
"
16471,"You see? This is exactly why
"
16472,"you shouldn't lie.
"
16473,"That's it. I am maid of honor.
"
16474,"-No, I am.
"
16475,"-How come you are?
"
16476,"Because I cared enough to lie.
"
16477,"Hey, I could help you decide
"
16478,"who should do it.
"
16479,"We could have an audition.
"
16480,"See how you'd handle
"
16481,"maid-of-honor-type situations.
"
16482,"-What do you mean?
"
16483,"-When I want a job. . .
"
16484,". . .I audition and if I'm the best
"
16485,"of the people they see. . .
"
16486,". . .I get the part.
"
16487,"So, okay, so after this audition,
"
16488,"who decides who gets it?
"
16489,"Oh, me and Ross can be the judges.
"
16490,"-It's better than us deciding.
"
16491,"-Oh, this is crazy.
"
16492,"-Can't we just flip a coin?
"
16493,"-No, coins hate me.
"
16494,"Okay, fine. You know what?
"
16495,"We will let Ross and Joey decide.
"
16496,"Hi!
"
16497,"Ross, sweetie.
"
16498,"Hey there, handsome thing.
"
16499,"Wow, this cologne really is

"
16501,"Hey.
"
16502,"Just brought back your videos.
"
16503,"Hey, Ross. Look, I think
"
16504,"we need to talk about before.
"
16505,"No. No, we don't.
"
16506,"Yes, we do.
"
16507,"Now, look.
"
16508,"That was the best nap I ever had.
"
16509,"I don't know what
"
16510,"you're talking about.
"
16511,"Come on, admit it.
"
16512,"That was the best nap you ever had.
"
16513,"I've had better.
"
16514,"Okay. When?
"
16515,"All right! All right!
"
16516,"It was the best nap ever!
"
16517,"I said it, okay?
"
16518,"But it's over, Joey!
"
16519,"I want to do it again.
"
16520,"We can't do it again.
"
16521,"-Why not?
"
16522,"-Because it's weird!
"
16523,"Fine.
"
16524,"You want a drink?
"
16525,"-Sure. What do you got?
"
16526,"-Warm milk and Excedrin PM.
"
16527,"Chandler.
"
16528,"I just figured out who you are.
"
16529,"Can you figure out what I'm doing?
"
16530,"-You're Louis Posen.
"
16531,"-Who?
"
16532,"He was my best friend in fifth grade.
"
16533,"One day, I asked him to be
"
16534,"my boyfriend and he said no.
"
16535,"Do you know why?
"
16536,"Because you kept talking to him while
"
16537,"he was trying to go to the bathroom?
"
16538,"No, but because he thought
"
16539,"I was too fa--
"
16540,"Every time I think about it,
"
16541,"I feel as bad as I did then.
"
16542,"I really think you should
"
16543,"apologize to Julie.
"
16544,"Honey, are you kidding?
"
16545,"That was like 1 6 years ago.
"
16546,"It would make me feel better
"
16547,"if Louis apologized to me.
"
16548,"I'll do it. But I warn you,
"
16549,"this may make me a better person.
"
16550,"And that is not the man
"
16551,"you fell in love with.
"
16552,"Okay, we'll give you hypothetical
"
16553,"maid-of-honor situations.
"
16554,"You'll be scored
"
16555,"on a scale of one to ten.
"
16556,"-One being the highest.
"
16557,"-Ten is the highest.
"
16558,"-Why is 1 0 the highest?
"
16559,"-Because it's the highest.
"
16560,"Okay, Rachel, you're up first.
"
16561,"Situation number one:
"
16562,"You're with Monica.
"
16563,"The wedding is about to start
"
16564,"when Monica gets cold feet. Go!
"
16565,"I don't want to marry Chandler.
"
16566,"-I've got cold feet.
"
16567,"-It's gonna be okay.
"
16568,"One man the rest of my life?
"
16569,"I don't know.
"
16570,"This means I'll never
"
16571,"get to sleep with Joey.
"
16572,"Look, Monica. . .
"
16573,". . .getting cold feet is very common.
"
16574,"It's just because
"
16575,"of all the anticipation.
"
16576,"And you just have to remember
"
16577,"that you love Chandler.
"
16578,"And also, I ran out on a wedding.
"
16579,"You don't get to keep the gifts.
"
16580,"Drawing on your own experience.
"
16581,"Very good.
"
16582,"Yes, very nice, Rachel.
"
16583,"Thank you, judges.
"
16584,"-Kiss ass.
"
16585,"-Oh.
"
16586,"-Okay, Phoebe.
"
16587,"-Yes, Your Honor.
"
16588,"We're now in the ceremony.
"
16589,"Monica is about to say, ""I do"" . . .
"
16590,". . .when her drunk uncle
"
16591,"starts yelling.
"
16592,"What do you do? Go!
"
16593,"When Monica was a little girl. . .
"
16594,". . .I remember that--
"
16595,"Ow!
"
16596,"-Very good!
"
16597,"-Oh.
"
16598,"Yes, excellent. Perfect score.
"
16599,"She just made a scene
"
16600,"in the middle of the ceremony!
"
16601,"Hey, you want
"
16602,"a little taste of Pheebs?
"
16603,"It is time for you to give
"
16604,"your maid-of-honor speech.
"
16605,"We haven't even prepared--
"
16606,"-Go!
"
16607,"-Okay, okay, okay.
"
16608,"Webster's Dictionary
"
16609,"defines marriage as--
"
16610,"Okay, no! Forget that! That sucks!
"
16611,"Okay, never mind. Forget it.
"
16612,"I met-- I met Monica when we were
"
16613,"just a couple of 6-year-olds. . .
"
16614,". . .and became friends with Chandler
"
16615,"when he was 25. . .
"
16616,". . .although he seemed
"
16617,"like a 6-year-old.
"
16618,"Oh.
"
16619,"Thank you. Thank you very much.
"
16620,"I've known them
"
16621,"separately and together.
"
16622,"To know them as a couple is to know
"
16623,"that you are in the presence of love.
"
16624,"So I would like to raise my glass. . .
"
16625,". . .to Monica and Chandler. . .
"
16626,". . .and the beautiful adventure they
"
16627,"are about to embark upon together.
"
16628,"I can think of no two people
"
16629,"better prepared for the journey.
"
16630,"Wow.
"
16631,"-Great speech.
"
16632,"-Yeah, it really was.
"
16633,"Oh, thanks.
"
16634,"Okay, Phoebe, I guess you're next.
"
16635,"Although I really don't see the point.
"
16636,"Okay.
"
16637,"I can't believe that Monica
"
16638,"and Chandler are getting married.
"
16639,"I remember talking
"
16640,"about this day with Rachel. . .
"
16641,". . .while we were
"
16642,"showering together, naked.
"
16643,"And she's back in the game!
"
16644,"Julie. Hi.
"
16645,"Chandler Bing.
"
16646,"I guess you remember me.
"
16647,"Hello, Skidmark.
"
16648,"It's a nickname. I'll explain later.
"
16649,"It's pretty clear.
"
16650,"I owe you a long, overdue apology.
"
16651,"I shouldn't have broken up with you
"
16652,"because of your weight.
"
16653,"That's why you broke up with me?
"
16654,"You didn't know that?
"
16655,"Well, I guess my work here is done.
"
16656,"First of all, I would like to say
"
16657,"you both performed very well, okay?
"
16658,"You should be proud.
"
16659,"And I'd also like to say, in this
"
16660,"competition, there are no losers.
"
16661,"Well, except Rachel. Damn it!
"
16662,"Really? I won.
"
16663,"-What?
"
16664,"-I'm sorry, Rach, it was really close.
"
16665,"-Well, then I demand a recount!
"
16666,"-Actually, it wasn't that close.
"
16667,"You know what?
"
16668,"Your thing was so stupid anyway.
"
16669,"We're gonna flip a coin, all right?
"
16670,"Heads.
"
16671,"What? The coins have
"
16672,"finally forgiven me!
"
16673,"Know what? I hope Monica
"
16674,"forgives you after you throw her. . .
"
16675,". . .vegetarian-voodoo-goddess-circle-y
"
16676,"shower.
"
16677,"Rach, it's gonna be okay.
"
16678,"You guys are the best!
"
16679,"Boy, I tell you. That judging stuff
"
16680,"took a lot out of me.
"
16681,"-Yeah?
"
16682,"-Yeah.
"
16683,"Thinking about maybe going upstairs
"
16684,"and taking a little nap on my couch.
"
16685,"Why would I care about that?
"
16686,"No reason. I'm just saying that. . .
"
16687,". . .that's where I'll be.
"
16688,"As bad as that went,
"
16689,"I actually enjoyed myself.
"
16690,"I think that I'm going to apologize
"
16691,"for all the stupid things that I do.
"
16692,"Why don't you just stop
"
16693,"doing stupid things?
"
16694,"-Then you wouldn't have to apologize.
"
16695,"-I'd love it if I could do both.
"
16696,"All right, I have to ask.
"
16697,"What?
"
16698,"Will you break up with me
"
16699,"if I get fat?
"
16700,"What?
"
16701,"You broke up with Julie.
"
16702,"How much weight did she gain?
"
16703,"A hundred and forty-five pounds.
"
16704,"In one year?
"
16705,"My God, what did she eat?
"
16706,"Her family?
"
16707,"That's not the point.
"
16708,"I know it was a stupid reason to
"
16709,"break up with someone, but I was 1 5.
"
16710,"Yeah, well, that's not
"
16711,"the only time this was an issue.
"
16712,"You remember when you spent
"
16713,"Thanksgiving with us?
"
16714,"You called me fat.
"
16715,"Wait a minute.
"
16716,"-That was totally different.
"
16717,"-How?
"
16718,"You were not supposed to hear that.
"
16719,"I said that behind your back.
"
16720,"What if I have babies, okay?
"
16721,"I'm gonna look different.
"
16722,"I'm okay with that,
"
16723,"but I'm not sure you are.
"
16724,"You have to realize I don't think
"
16725,"of you as a thin, beautiful woman.
"
16726,"This is one of the things that
"
16727,"I can apologize for later.
"
16728,"What I mean is, you're Monica.
"
16729,"Okay? And I am in love with Monica.
"
16730,"Keep going.
"
16731,"So you can balloon up
"
16732,"or you can shrink down. . .
"
16733,". . .and I will still love you.
"
16734,"Even if I were to shrink down
"
16735,"to 2 inches tall?
"
16736,"I'd carry you around in my pocket.
"
16737,"I love you.
"
16738,"Skidmark still got a way
"
16739,"with the ladies.
"
16740,"Hi, Pheebs.
"
16741,"-Hi.
"
16742,"-Hi.
"
16743,"I just want to apologize.
"
16744,"I'm really sorry I was a baby.
"
16745,"That's ridiculous.
"
16746,"Rachel, we were all babies once.
"
16747,"Oh, you mean today. Yeah.
"
16748,"Yeah, and you know,
"
16749,"you deserve to win.
"
16750,"And I was thinking about it.
"
16751,"If you're Monica's maid of honor,
"
16752,"I get to be yours.
"
16753,"-Oh, yeah.
"
16754,"-Yeah.
"
16755,"When Monica and Chandler got engaged,
"
16756,"I put some stuff together.
"
16757,"-Just in case.
"
16758,"-Oh, that's so sweet. Thanks.
"
16759,"Here is a book of poetry
"
16760,"that I know Monica loves.
"
16761,"Oh, God, this is funny. Look.
"
16762,"Here's a picture from one Halloween
"
16763,"when she dressed up as a bride.
"
16764,"She made me carry her train. . .
"
16765,". . .which was weird
"
16766,"because I was Wonder Woman.
"
16767,"Oh, and here's
"
16768,"a little purse that I found.
"
16769,"I just thought they could hold
"
16770,"the rings in there.
"
16771,"-Oh.
"
16772,"-Something. And. . .
"
16773,". . .vintage handkerchiefs, you know,
"
16774,"because people cry at weddings.
"
16775,"I'm just gonna grab a couple of these.
"
16776,"This stuff is great.
"
16777,"I forgot this was in here.
"
16778,"This was the garter
"
16779,"that I was saving for my wedding.
"
16780,"And I wanted it
"
16781,"to be Monica's ""something borrowed. ""
"
16782,"And it's blue.
"
16783,"Rach, I think that you should be
"
16784,"Monica's maid of honor.
"
16785,"You do?
"
16786,"-Why?
"
16787,"-Because I think it means more to you.
"
16788,"But, Pheebs, honey, you earned it.
"
16789,"It's fine.
"
16790,"I mean, this is something. . .
"
16791,". . .that you've been thinking about
"
16792,"since you were, what, 1 4?
"
16793,"No, I was 1 0.
"
16794,"I just developed early.
"
16795,"Man alive!
"
16796,"-Hey, what's going on?
"
16797,"-Hey!
"
16798,"We decided Rachel is
"
16799,"going to be your maid of honor.
"
16800,"Oh, that's great!
"
16801,"Oh, wow. Okay, we really
"
16802,"have to start planning.
"
16803,"I have really specific ideas.
"
16804,"We should meet four times a week.
"
16805,"Come to my place,
"
16806,"we'll get together before work.
"
16807,"What do you say, 6:30, my place?
"
16808,"So excited!
"
16809,"Yeah, okay. You laugh now.
"
16810,"She's gonna be yours.
"
16811,"Great nap.
"
16812,"It really was.
"
16813,"What the hell are you doing?
"
16814,"God!
"
16815,"Excuse me.
"
16816,"<font color=""#ffff00"" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net
"
16817,"-Morning.
"
16818,"-Hi.
"
16819,"How was your date?
"
16820,"-Pretty good.
"
16821,"-Oh, good.
"
16822,"My God. Sorry about that.
"
16823,"Okay, really good.
"
16824,"I gotta go. I'm late.
"
16825,"You're going to leave
"
16826,"her with me?
"
16827,"Don't worry,
"
16828,"she's a terrific girl.
"
16829,"Can you do me a favor?
"
16830,"Could you mention I'm not looking
"
16831,"for a relationship? That'd be great.
"
16832,"What, are you kidding?
"
16833,"Just casually slip it in, you know.
"
16834,"Lay the groundwork.
"
16835,"Tell her I'm a loner.
"
16836,"No, an outlaw.
"
16837,"She doesn't want to get mixed up
"
16838,"with the likes of me.
"
16839,"That's a lot to remember.
"
16840,"Can't I tell her that you're a pig?
"
16841,"I'm gonna call her later myself.
"
16842,"Honest.
"
16843,"Chandler used to do it.
"
16844,"He'd make her pancakes.
"
16845,"Plus he'd make extras
"
16846,"and leave them for me.
"
16847,"I'm not telling her anything.
"
16848,"It's not my responsibility.
"
16849,"Fine.
"
16850,"Now, where did we land
"
16851,"on those pancakes?
"
16852,"-Hi.
"
16853,"-Hi.
"
16854,"Sorry, but I couldn't get
"
16855,"that lock to work.
"
16856,"Yeah, Joey kind of disabled it
"
16857,"when I moved in.
"
16858,"-You must be Rachel. I'm Erin.
"
16859,"-Hi.
"
16860,"I don't mean this to sound like high
"
16861,"school, but did he talk about me?
"
16862,"Would you like some pancakes?
"

16866,"-Come on. Why are we here?
"
16867,"-Okay, okay, take a guess.
"
16868,"The hot chicks?
"
16869,"Okay, okay, I was typing names
"
16870,"into the library computer earlier. . .
"
16871,". . .you know, for fun.
"
16872,"And I typed mine in,
"
16873,"and guess what came up?
"
16874,"My doctoral dissertation.
"
16875,"It's right down here in the biggest
"
16876,"library in the university.
"
16877,"Wow, that's actually pretty cool.
"
16878,"There's also a book here
"
16879,"by a woman named Wendy Bagina.
"
16880,"What is that?
"
16881,"Sounds like two people are really
"
16882,"enjoying the Dewey decimal system.
"
16883,"We're so sorry.
"
16884,"You didn't bring me here to do that,
"
16885,"did you?
"
16886,"She sent the chicken back again?
"
16887,"She said it's too dry now and wants
"
16888,"to explain to you how she wants it.
"
16889,"I'd like to meet this chicken expert.
"
16890,"Send the colonel in.
"
16891,"Oh, my God!
"
16892,"Lucky bastard.
"
16893,"-Janice.
"
16894,"-How are you. . .
"
16895,". . .Ms. Hotshot-Chef-at-the-Big-Fancy-

"
16897,"I'm fine.
"
16898,"Oh, what is that on your finger?
"
16899,"I'm blind.
"
16900,"So who's the lucky guy?
"
16901,"Oh, my God.
"
16902,"I am so sorry, sweetie.
"
16903,"Are you okay?
"
16904,"You didn't tell her we're engaged?
"
16905,"-She saw the ring.
"
16906,"-Did she freak out?
"
16907,"She was shocked,
"
16908,"but then again, so were most people.
"
16909,"She actually has a boyfriend herself.
"
16910,"Name's Clark.
"
16911,"She also invited herself
"
16912,"to our wedding.
"
16913,"Clark too.
"
16914,"You said no, right?
"
16915,"You said no, right?
"
16916,"She cornered me. She asked me
"
16917,"if the wedding was in town.
"
16918,"-What was I supposed to do?
"
16919,"-Lie.
"
16920,"How hard is that?
"
16921,"""Your check's in the mail. ""
"
16922,"""Oh, your baby's so cute. ""
"
16923,"""I can't wait to read your book, Ross. ""
"
16924,"So she comes to the wedding.
"
16925,"Maybe it won't be so bad.
"
16926,"Think she'll sit quietly?
"
16927,"Think she'll want to make a toast?
"
16928,"You don't think she'll want
"
16929,"to sing ""Part-Time Lover""?
"
16930,"Oh, my God. She's not gonna like
"
16931,"the chicken either, is she?
"
16932,"You know what? It'll be okay.
"
16933,"She's probably not gonna even
"
16934,"want to come.
"
16935,"-Really?
"
16936,"-No, that was a lie.
"
16937,"See how easy that was?
"
16938,"So you would have just lied?
"
16939,"Yes.
"
16940,"-It would have really been that easy?
"
16941,"-Yes.
"
16942,"Do it Saturday. We're having
"
16943,"dinner with her and Clark.
"
16944,"Hey, what's up?
"
16945,"Hey, who's your friend?
"
16946,"-Hey, Joey.
"
16947,"-Erin.
"
16948,"You're still here.
"
16949,"We ended up spending the day together
"
16950,"and had such a great time.
"
16951,"Why wouldn't you? Erin is great.
"
16952,"And then there's you guys.
"
16953,"Well, listen, I better get going.
"
16954,"Today was great. Thanks.
"
16955,"And Joey, last night was fun.
"
16956,"Yeah. I'll call you.
"
16957,"-I'll call you too.
"
16958,"-Or I'll call you.
"
16959,"-And call me.
"
16960,"-Okay.
"
16961,"Good to see you again.
"
16962,"-Bye-bye.
"
16963,"-Bye.
"
16964,"The system kind of broke down, huh?
"
16965,"Joey, I'm sorry. I just couldn't
"
16966,"tell her all those things.
"
16967,"And we got to talking, and l--
"
16968,"We want you to marry her.
"
16969,"What?
"
16970,"She is so amazing. You have no idea.
"
16971,"Who do you think brought her here?
"
16972,"Cupid.
"
16973,"She's so cool.
"
16974,"She speaks four languages.
"
16975,"Man, do you know what guys want.
"
16976,"Come on, she's so perfect for you.
"
16977,"She's sweet.
"
16978,"She likes baseball.
"
16979,"She had two beers at lunch.
"
16980,"My beers?!
"
16981,"Look, she's a very nice girl.
"
16982,"We had a very good time,
"
16983,"but I don't see it going anywhere.
"
16984,"You always say that.
"
16985,"Maybe if you gave her a chance,
"
16986,"it would go somewhere.
"
16987,"I'm sorry, you guys.
"
16988,"I just don't think so.
"
16989,"-Whatever.
"
16990,"-Fine.
"
16991,"Hey, don't start judging me.
"
16992,"You're in love with your assistant.
"
16993,"You're sleeping with the guy
"
16994,"who keeps pigeons on the roof.
"
16995,"Phoebe!
"
16996,"Secret affair.
"
16997,"People are doing it
"
16998,"in front of my book.
"
16999,"I'm sorry?
"
17000,"My doctoral dissertation is in the
"
17001,"library at school. I went to see it.
"
17002,"And there were students making babies
"
17003,"right in the paleontology section.
"
17004,"Oh, my God.
"
17005,"Did you get to see anything good?
"
17006,"At your school. . .
"
17007,". . .was there a place on campus
"
17008,"where students went to fool around?
"
17009,"Yeah, there was.
"
17010,"In the corner of the library where all
"
17011,"the books were that nobody ever read.
"
17012,"Yes, there was.
"
17013,"Great, because people kept showing up.
"
17014,"I think it's like a thing.
"
17015,"Hold on a second.
"
17016,"Fifth floor, against that back wall?
"
17017,"Oh, for crying out loud!
"
17018,"-So we should go catch our movie.
"
17019,"-What's the rush?
"
17020,"I'd like to see the previews.
"
17021,"The candy.
"
17022,"-Oh, hey.
"
17023,"-Well, look who's here.
"
17024,"-Hey, Joey.
"
17025,"-Hey, Erin.
"
17026,"-Hey, Rachel.
"
17027,"-Hi.
"
17028,"We were about to take off
"
17029,"and see a movie.
"
17030,"-Oh, no!
"
17031,"-What's wrong?
"
17032,"Phoebe, we forgot that party
"
17033,"we have to go to.
"
17034,"Oh, no.
"
17035,"What party?
"
17036,"A birthday party.
"
17037,"Whose birthday party?
"
17038,"Alison's birthday party.
"
17039,"And how old is Alison?
"
17040,"Thirty-two.
"
17041,"Wait a minute.
"
17042,"Why don't you guys do something?
"
17043,"Look how that worked out.
"
17044,"Excuse me. Hi, I'm a professor here.
"
17045,"Do you know the paleontology section,
"
17046,"fifth floor, stack 437?
"
17047,"Well, yes.
"
17048,"Just give me five minutes.
"
17049,"I just have to find someone
"
17050,"to cover my shift.
"
17051,"No, no, no.
"
17052,"Can I speak to someone in charge?
"
17053,"How can I help?
"
17054,"Hi, I was wondering, is it possible
"
17055,"to increase security. . .
"
17056,". . .in the paleontology section?
"
17057,"I wrote a book that's up there.
"
17058,"And instead of reading it,
"
17059,"people are. . . .
"
17060,"Well, they're rolling around
"
17061,"in front of it.
"
17062,"We are aware of the problem
"
17063,"you're referring to.
"
17064,"As far as increasing security,
"
17065,"I'm afraid the library's understaffed.
"
17066,"I can't help you.
"
17067,"Well, fine.
"
17068,"If I'm the only person
"
17069,"with any appreciation. . .
"
17070,". . .of the sanctity of the written
"
17071,"word, then I'll go defend it myself.
"
17072,"Don't you follow me.
"
17073,"-How did it go with Erin?
"
17074,"-Unbelievable.
"
17075,"We had the best time.
"
17076,"-So you're not mad anymore?
"
17077,"-No, no. You guys were totally right.
"
17078,"This was much better than
"
17079,"the first date.
"
17080,"It was awkward.
"
17081,"We were both nervous.
"
17082,"-Didn't you sleep together?
"
17083,"-Yeah, that calms me down.
"
17084,"And we have so much in common.
"
17085,"She loves sandwiches, sports.
"
17086,"Although she is a Met fan.
"
17087,"Not an issue now,
"
17088,"but if we had kids. . . .
"
17089,"Oh, my God! Listen to you talking
"
17090,"about having kids.
"
17091,"Oh, my Joey.
"
17092,"Please don't get married before I do.
"
17093,"I just cannot believe
"
17094,"that Clark stood me up.
"
17095,"He may still show up.
"
17096,"What are you, stupid?
"
17097,"-It's been three hours.
"
17098,"-Is that all?
"
17099,"Let's go on to happier things.
"
17100,"Why don't you tell me
"
17101,"about your lovely wedding.
"
17102,"There was something that we wanted
"
17103,"to tell you about the wedding.
"
17104,"It's going to be a small ceremony.
"
17105,"Tiny.
"
17106,"We're not even sure
"
17107,"why we're having it.
"
17108,"It's actually going to be just family.
"
17109,"Oh, wait.
"
17110,"You two think of me as family?
"
17111,"I have to ask you something now,
"
17112,"and be honest.
"
17113,"Do you want me to sing
"
17114,"""Careless Whisper"" or ""Lady in Red""?
"
17115,"How can you say that?
"
17116,"The Mets have no closer.
"
17117,"-What about Benitez?
"
17118,"-What about game one of the series?
"
17119,"-What about shut up?
"
17120,"-You shut up.
"
17121,"I love arguing with her.
"
17122,"-Be right back.
"
17123,"-Okay.
"
17124,"How's it going with Joey?
"
17125,"Oh, okay.
"
17126,"Okay?
"
17127,"Tell me that you like him, please.
"
17128,"I mean, tell me that you like him.
"
17129,"He's a really great guy, and I know
"
17130,"you really want this to work out. . .
"
17131,". . .but I just don't see this
"
17132,"having a future.
"
17133,"But you said that you liked him.
"
17134,"What happened?
"
17135,"Did you just change your mind?
"
17136,"-Kind of.
"
17137,"-Then change it back!
"
17138,"I'm sorry.
"
17139,"It's just, there's no real spark.
"
17140,"Didn't you sleep together?
"
17141,"Yeah.
"
17142,"Tramp.
"
17143,"Does Joey have any idea?
"
17144,"I don't think he does.
"
17145,"You know what?
"
17146,"Maybe you could tell him
"
17147,"I'm not interested. . .
"
17148,". . .in a serious relationship.
"
17149,"You mean, like,
"
17150,"that you're kind of a loner?
"
17151,"Yeah, that'd be great.
"
17152,"And maybe that you're a real stronzo.
"
17153,"I'm sorry.
"
17154,"I guess ltalian isn't one
"
17155,"of the four languages you speak.
"
17156,"-Hey. Want to go?
"
17157,"-Yeah, let's go.
"
17158,"-Okay. See you guys later.
"
17159,"-Bye, guys.
"
17160,"Hey, thank you so much.
"
17161,"Wow.
"
17162,"I guess it wasn't cupid
"
17163,"that brought her here.
"
17164,"No, just a regular old flying dwarf.
"
17165,"Yes, yes. How can I help you?
"
17166,"We were just looking around.
"
17167,"Oh, you're fellow scholars.
"
17168,"What exactly were you looking for?
"
17169,"Perhaps Dr. Chester Stock's
"
17170,"musings. . .
"
17171,". . .on the Smilodon californicus?
"
17172,"Get out of here!
"
17173,"Meeting someone?
"
17174,"Or are you just here to brush up. . .
"
17175,". . .on Merriam's views on evolution?
"
17176,"Actually, I find Merriam's views
"
17177,"far too progressionist.
"
17178,"I find Merriam's views
"
17179,"far too progressionist.
"
17180,"I'm sorry. Who are you?
"
17181,"I'm a professor here. Ross Geller.
"
17182,"Ross Geller? Why do I know that name?
"
17183,"It's a. . . .
"
17184,"Wait.
"
17185,"Did you write this?
"
17186,"Yes.
"
17187,"You're the person
"
17188,"who checked out my book?
"
17189,"You know, you look nothing
"
17190,"like I would have thought.
"
17191,"You're so young.
"
17192,"Well, I skipped fourth grade.
"
17193,"I am very, very sorry.
"
17194,"-So how was your date?
"
17195,"-Great. We walked around the Village.
"
17196,"We went to this ice cream place.
"
17197,"Split a milk shake.
"
17198,"Seventy-thirty, but still.
"
17199,"I'm thinking of taking her upstate
"
17200,"to one of those bed and breakfasts.
"
17201,"Really? She said she wants to go?
"
17202,"No, it's a surprise. It's gonna be
"
17203,"tricky, because she's busy at work.
"
17204,"Joey, look, honey,
"
17205,"we need to talk, okay?
"
17206,"I got the feeling from her. . .
"
17207,". . .that she's not looking
"
17208,"for a serious relationship.
"
17209,"-Where are you getting this?
"
17210,"-She told me.
"
17211,"She said she's kind of a loner.
"
17212,"-Joey--
"
17213,"-Hey, Rach, it's cool, you know.
"
17214,"I'm a loner too, right?
"
17215,"Hey, Joey. You know what?
"
17216,"You are way too good for her.
"
17217,"I promise, next time I will tell them
"
17218,"you're not looking for a relationship.
"
17219,"No, don't do that. Just. . . .
"
17220,"-Next time, make sure she likes me.
"
17221,"-Well, that too.
"
17222,"Joey?
"
17223,"-Do you want some pancakes?
"
17224,"-Finally.
"
17225,"What are we gonna do?
"
17226,"I say we go with ""Careless Whisper. ""
"
17227,"Chandler?
"
17228,"Did she see us yet? Did she see us?
"
17229,"Janice, what are you doing here?
"
17230,"I thought I was gonna go back
"
17231,"to my apartment. . .
"
17232,". . .but I just felt like I really
"
17233,"couldn't be alone tonight.
"
17234,"I was just wondering if I could maybe
"
17235,"stay here with you.
"
17236,"Just, I really feel like I need
"
17237,"to be with family.
"
17238,"Our kids are gonna call her
"
17239,"Aunt Janice, aren't they?
"
17240,"Please. Because otherwise,
"
17241,"I really don't know what I might do.
"
17242,"Aren't you just a teensy bit curious?
"
17243,"-You have any tissues?
"
17244,"-Yeah, in the bathroom.
"
17245,"We'll just let her stay.
"
17246,"No. If we let her stay,
"
17247,"she will stay forever.
"
17248,"-Kind of like your Barcalounger.
"
17249,"-Is that what you're thinking about?
"
17250,"I never stop thinking about it.
"
17251,"Hey, you guys?
"
17252,"Do either one of you want to get
"
17253,"in there before I take my bath?
"
17254,"Janice, I'm sorry. . .
"
17255,". . .but you can't stay here tonight.
"
17256,"Why not?
"
17257,"Honestly?
"
17258,"Our apartment is a hotbed. . .
"
17259,". . .for electromagnetic activity.
"
17260,"Monica and I have been immunized,
"
17261,"but sadly. . .
"
17262,". . .you have not.
"
17263,"I'm gonna need a comforter.
"
17264,"Do you have a hypoallergenic one?
"
17265,"Because otherwise I get very nasal.
"
17266,"Do you have a cat?
"
17267,"Because it's already happening.
"
17268,"Do you hear that? Listen.
"
17269,"Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
"
17270,"You have to go.
"
17271,"Why?
"
17272,"Because Chandler still has
"
17273,"feelings for you.
"
17274,"He does?
"
17275,"Say again?
"
17276,"That's right. That's right.
"
17277,"And that is why you can't
"
17278,"stay here tonight.
"
17279,"And probably why you shouldn't come
"
17280,"to the wedding.
"
17281,"Feelings. Such strong feelings.
"
17282,"I mean, I realize that his feelings
"
17283,"may never completely go away. . .
"
17284,". . .but you can.
"
17285,"Oh, my God.
"
17286,"I understand. I am so sorry.
"
17287,"I'll go.
"
17288,"Goodbye, Monica.
"
17289,"I wish you a lifetime
"
17290,"of happiness with him.

17291,"Chandler.
"
17292,"You call me when this goes
"

"
17294,"I've got this section covered.
"
17295,"Yeah, in fact, I've got this baby

"
17303,"Are we keeping Thanksgiving
"
17304,"a secret this year?
"
17305,"We're playing a game
"
17306,"I learned.
"
17307,"You have to name all the states

"
17309,"What? That's like insanely easy.
"
17310,"It's harder than it sounds.
"
17311,"You always forget one.
"
17312,"Or in some cases, 14.
"
17313,"It's stupid and I wasn't playing with
"
17314,"people, so technically, I didn't lose.
"
17315,"You forgot 14 states?
"
17316,"Nobody cares about the Dakotas!
"
17317,"Okay, time's up.
"
17318,"All right, I got 48.
"
17319,"That's not bad. Pheebs?
"
17320,"I got tired of naming states,
"
17321,"so I listed the types of celery.
"

17369,"I'm going to go turn on Joey's oven.
"
17370,"Please, watch him.
"
17371,"Do not let Joey eat any of the food.
"
17372,"I am only one man.
"
17373,"- Okay, time is up.
"
17374,"- Now, just give me another minute.
"
17375,"If you don't know them by now,
"
17376,"you never will, okay?
"
17377,"That is the beauty of this game.
"
17378,"It makes you want to kill yourself.
"
17379,"This is crazy. I can do this.
"
17380,"All right, I bet I can get
"
17381,"all 50 before dinner.
"
17382,"Okay, but if you can't, no dinner.
"
17383,"You're on.
"
17384,"Don't look at my list, because there's
"
17385,"a lot on there that you don't have.
"
17386,"Did you know your oven doesn't work?
"
17387,"The drawer full of takeout
"
17388,"menus is okay, right?
"
17389,"Ross, I'm gonna use yours.
"
17390,"Chandler, give me a hand.
"
17391,"Joey, do not let Ross look at maps
"
17392,"or the globe in your apartment.
"
17393,"Don't worry.
"
17394,"It's not a globe of the United States.
"
17395,"I'm gonna go out and take a walk.
"
17396,"Phoebe, why is your bag moving?
"
17397,"- Oh, it's not.
"
17398,"- Seriously, it's moving.
"
17399,"- What the hell's in there?
"
17400,"- It's just my knitting. That's all.
"
17401,"Yes, I knit this.
"
17402,"I'm very good.
"
17403,"Ross' apartment is nice.
"
17404,"Why don't we hang out here?
"
17405,"Maybe because it smells weird.
"
17406,"It's like old pumpkins or something.
"
17407,"- That's my pie.
"
17408,"- Which smells delicious.
"
17409,"- Uh-oh. Uh-oh.
"
17410,"- What?
"
17411,"We left Joey alone with the food.
"
17412,"Yep, yep, I knew it.
"
17413,"There he is...
"
17414,"...feeding stuffing to a dog!
"
17415,"Hi, Geller-Bing residence.
"
17416,"How can I help?
"
17417,"Why is a dog in our apartment?
"
17418,"I'm sorry, who's this?
"
17419,"There's a dog sitting on my couch.
"
17420,"Tell her I'm allergic, and I will sue!
"
17421,"- There's no dog here.
"
17422,"- There is!
"
17423,"He's black and white and shaggy.
"
17424,"He's sitting next to Rachel
"
17425,"and licking her hand. 
"
17426,"Oh, my God! Where are you?
"
17427,"I'll be right there.
"
17428,"They're here already?
"
17429,"How are they doing this?!
"
17430,"Hi, Tag.
"
17431,"What are you doing here?
"
17432,"I wanted to see if your offer
"
17433,"was still good.
"
17434,"Well, sure. Come in.
"
17435,"Well, what happened
"
17436,"to your girlfriend?
"
17437,"We kind of broke up this morning.
"
17438,"- Oh, I'm sorry.
"
17439,"- Yeah, so she went back to Ohio.
"
17440,"Ohio, thank you.
"
17441,"Where's the dog?
"
17442,"What dog? There's no dog here.
"
17443,"Yeah, that dog left.
"
17444,"Phoebe. Phoebe, open up.
"
17445,"There's no dog in here.
"
17446,"Phoebe, we can hear the dog barking.
"
17447,"No, that's just me coughing.
"
17448,"Oh, good. There you are.
"
17449,"Listen, I have a dog in my room.
"
17450,"What is it doing here?
"
17451,"I'm watching it for friends
"
17452,"who left town.
"
17453,"Wait.
"
17454,"Hello, my name is Klunkers.
"
17455,"May I please stay
"
17456,"with you nice people?
"
17457,"I wish he could stay,
"
17458,"but Chandler's allergic.
"
17459,"Extremely allergic, okay?
"
17460,"If I'm anywhere near a dog
"
17461,"for more than five minutes...
"
17462,"...my throat will just close up.
"
17463,"That's odd. This dog's been
"
17464,"living here for the past three days.
"
17465,"Really?
"
17466,"If he's been here
"
17467,"that long...
"
17468,"...without a reaction, maybe
"
17469,"you're not allergic to it.
"
17470,"It still has to go, right?
"
17471,"Why?
"
17472,"- Okay, it's...
"
17473,"- Don't do it!
"
17474,"- Don't do what?
"
17475,"- I have to.
"
17476,"Okay? It's time.
"
17477,"Okay, I hate dogs.
"
17478,"- What?!
"
17479,"- That's crazy? Why?
"
17480,"Told you.
"
17481,"They are needy...
"
17482,"...jumpy, and you can't tell
"
17483,"what they are thinking...
"
17484,"...and that scares me a little bit.
"
17485,"You're right. They are scary.
"
17486,"She just ate a treat out of my hand!
"
17487,"Wait. Do you not like all dogs?
"
17488,"I mean, not even puppies?
"
17489,"Is there a puppy here?
"
17490,"- You don't like puppies?
"
17491,"- Okay, you are new.
"
17492,"Look, Chandler, I told you. Never
"
17493,"tell anyone about this dog thing.
"
17494,"It's like Ross not liking ice cream.
"
17495,"- You don't like ice cream?
"
17496,"- It's too cold!
"
17497,"It's just that dogs make me
"
17498,"a little uncomfortable.
"
17499,"Hurts my teeth.
"
17500,"And I don't want you guys
"
17501,"to hate me...
"
17502,"...but I don't think I can be around
"
17503,"that dog anymore, okay?
"
17504,"So either the dog goes or I go.
"
17505,"Oh, my God!
"
17506,"How can I not get this?
"
17507,"I'm a college professor.
"
17508,"I got 1 450 on my SATs.
"
17509,"Twelve fifty.
"
17510,"Damn, I forgot you were here.
"
17511,"We're gonna take Klunkers to Ross'.
"
17512,"We'll be back soon.
"
17513,"Can I ask you a question?
"
17514,"When a guy breaks up
"
17515,"with his girlfriend...
"
17516,"...what is an appropriate amount
"
17517,"of time to wait before making a move?
"
17518,"I'd say about a month.
"
17519,"Really? I'd say three to four.
"
17520,"Half-hour.
"
17521,"Interesting.
"
17522,"When it's your assistant,
"
17523,"I'd say never.
"
17524,"All right, Rach, the big question is,
"
17525,"does he like you?
"
17526,"Because if he doesn't like you,
"
17527,"this is all a moo point.
"
17528,"A ""moo"" point?
"
17529,"Yeah. It's like a cow's opinion.
"
17530,"It just doesn't matter.
"
17531,"It's ""moo. ""
"
17532,"Have I been living with him
"
17533,"for too long, or did that make sense?
"
17534,"Don't listen to Joey.
"
17535,"Okay, would you look at him?
"
17536,"He's obviously depressed.
"
17537,"He's away from his family.
"
17538,"What he needs right now is
"
17539,"for you to be his friend.
"
17540,"You're right. I'm sorry.
"
17541,"Thank you.
"
17542,"- Okay, that's what I'm going to do.
"
17543,"- Fine, take their advice.
"
17544,"No one ever listens to me.
"
17545,"When the package is this pretty,
"
17546,"no one cares what's inside.
"
17547,"How you holding up?
"
17548,"Not bad.
"
17549,"- I'm sorry about your girlfriend.
"
17550,"- Thanks.
"
17551,"- Were you guys together a long time?
"
17552,"- A year, on and off.
"
17553,"I thought we'd end up together.
"
17554,"I don't anymore.
"
17555,"- Now that she broke up with you.
"
17556,"- Yeah.
"
17557,"It's weird.
"
17558,"I used to assume that I would meet
"
17559,"someone and fall in love and be happy.
"
17560,"That all that was just a given.
"
17561,"Lately, it's like, what if it's not?
"
17562,"Do you ever have that feeling?
"
17563,"No.
"
17564,"Yeah.
"
17565,"All the time.
"
17566,"Constantly. It's terrifying.
"
17567,"But you know, then I figure
"
17568,"it has to work out.
"
17569,"Why?
"
17570,"Because it has to.
"
17571,"- You have all the answers, don't you?
"
17572,"- No, no, I do. I really do.
"
17573,"- Thanks for talking to me.
"
17574,"- Come on, what are bosses for?
"
17575,"Hug it out.
"
17576,"All right, he likes you back.
"
17577,"Told you you should go for it.
"
17578,"What?
"
17579,"Street noise drown any of that out?
"
17580,"No? See you later.
"
17581,"Okay.
"
17582,"What did Joey say? I like you back?
"
17583,"Joey knows that I'm very insecure
"
17584,"about my back.
"
17585,"And you were hugging me...
"
17586,"...so obviously you are not
"
17587,"repulsed by it. Yeah!
"
17588,"- Wait, that doesn't make any sense.
"
17589,"- No?
"
17590,"All right, here's the truth.
"
17591,"Joey said what he said...
"
17592,"...because I'm attracted to you.
"
17593,"Wow.
"
17594,"Yeah, I admit it.
"
17595,"I have a crush on you. I know that's
"
17596,"crazy because we work together...
"
17597,"...and nothing could ever happen.
"
17598,"The last thing I wanted to do
"
17599,"was freak you out...
"
17600,"...or make you feel uncomfortable.
"
17601,"Which is why it would be great
"
17602,"if you said something right about now.
"
17603,"Oh, my God.
"
17604,"Those guys are stealing my car.
"
17605,"What?
"
17606,"Right there. That's my car!
"
17607,"- Hey!
"
17608,"- Okay, that'll take one minute.
"
17609,"Do you have anything else to say?
"
17610,"I can't believe it.
"
17611,"We still have time to talk,
"
17612,"and they're not even in the car yet.
"
17613,"Look, there they go.
"
17614,"Okay, Phoebe.
"
17615,"We should probably go back now.
"
17616,"Please, don't leave me.
"
17617,"I'll be lonely.
"
17618,"Stop it. Stop.
"
17619,"- Okay, let's go. We can be strong.
"
17620,"- Yeah, okay.
"
17621,"Did you hear that?
"
17622,"She said, ""Monica. ""
"
17623,"I can't leave her.
"
17624,"We could sneak the dog back
"
17625,"and Chandler wouldn't even know.
"
17626,"That won't work.
"
17627,"I've had that dog for three days,
"
17628,"and Chandler had no idea.
"
17629,"He's not so smart.
"
17630,"Hey. I didn't know either.
"
17631,"Yeah, but you kind of knew that
"
17632,"something was going on, didn't you?
"
17633,"Yeah, I knew.
"
17634,"Where's Chandler?
"
17635,"- Here I am.
"
17636,"- Wash your hands.
"
17637,"How did you know?
"
17638,"Hey, what's she doing back here?
"
17639,"Relax, Ross.
"
17640,"She's not made of ice cream.
"
17641,"Hey, look, Phoebe.
"
17642,"I laid out the states geographically.
"
17643,"We don't have time.
"
17644,"We have to keep Chandler away.
"
17645,"- Yeah, but, look what...
"
17646,"- This is what we do not have time for!
"
17647,"- Where's Monica?
"
17648,"- In Phoebe's room. You can't go in.
"
17649,"Why not?
"
17650,"Monica's crying.
"
17651,"She's very upset
"
17652,"about this whole Klunkers thing.
"
17653,"- Well, I should go in there.
"
17654,"- No, no.
"
17655,"No, she doesn't want to see
"
17656,"you right now.
"
17657,"- Why not?
"
17658,"- Because you sent away the dog.
"
17659,"- That's ridiculous.
"
17660,"- Oh, is it? Is it?!
"
17661,"Look, when Monica and I were kids,
"
17662,"we had a dog named Rover.
"
17663,"And one day, my dad decides
"
17664,"he doesn't like dogs.
"
17665,"So Monica and her friend, Phyllis...
"
17666,"...take away the dog and that was the
"
17667,"last time we ever saw him. See?
"
17668,"This is just like that...
"
17669,"...only with a few details changed.
"
17670,"Okay, I'm in my sweatpants.
"
17671,"Bring on the food.
"
17672,"- What's the matter?
"
17673,"- Monica's upset because of Klunkers.
"
17674,"So? Bring the dog back.
"
17675,"You're a hero.
"
17676,"Yeah, I could be a hero.
"
17677,"I could do that.
"
17678,"What if it attacks me?
"
17679,"Chandler, it's like a big gerbil.
"
17680,"And that doesn't scare you?
"
17681,"Ross, you need some help?
"
17682,"From you?
"
17683,"Yes, please.
"
17684,"First of all, Utah?
"
17685,"Dude, you can't just make stuff up.
"
17686,"I hate America!
"
17687,"When I finish this game,
"
17688,"I swear I am moving.
"
17689,"- Tag still talking to the police?
"
17690,"- Yeah.
"
17691,"Dammit. Why did I open my mouth?
"
17692,"""I have a crush on you.
"
17693,"I'm attracted to you. ""
"
17694,"I know that I freaked him out.
"
17695,"If you said it like that, you did.
"
17696,"Hey, is Chandler here?
"
17697,"No, he went for a walk.
"
17698,"Okay, you cannot tell him,
"
17699,"but look who's back.
"
17700,"Well, no, no, no.
"
17701,"He went over to Ross' to bring
"
17702,"the dog back here.
"
17703,"Oh, no, the dog's not going
"
17704,"to be there!
"
17705,"You think?
"
17706,"Hi, honey.
"
17707,"Please, please, please,
"
17708,"don't be mad at me.
"
17709,"- What? Why would...?
"
17710,"- Wait and see.
"
17711,"Maybe we will, maybe we won't.
"
17712,"Okay, I went over to Ross'
"
17713,"to bring back Klunkers for you...
"
17714,"...and I left the door open,
"
17715,"and she must've gotten out.
"
17716,"And I looked everywhere, all over
"
17717,"the apartment, including the roof.
"
17718,"Which, FYI, Ross,
"
17719,"one of your neighbors, growing weed.
"
17720,"I couldn't find him...
"
17721,"...and I am so, so, so sorry.
"
17722,"But I do know where we can all go
"
17723,"ease the pain.
"
17724,"We have good news. Look who's back!
"
17725,"Klunkers. Oh, my God!
"
17726,"- She came back all by herself.
"
17727,"- It's a Thanksgiving miracle.
"
17728,"It is so good to see you.
"
17729,"She came all the way back
"
17730,"from Ross'.
"
17731,"The things she must've seen.
"
17732,"She climbed up the fire escape...
"
17733,"...and tapped on the window with her
"
17734,"teeny paw, and we ran to let her in.
"
17735,"I went too far, didn't I?
"
17736,"When should I have stopped?
"
17737,"Okay, maybe this is so hard,
"
17738,"because there aren't 50 states.
"
17739,"Let me tell you something.
"
17740,"I have 49 states...
"
17741,"...and there are no more!
"
17742,"I think I should be able
"
17743,"to eat something.
"
17744,"It's up to you.
"
17745,"- Oh, hi. How are you doing?
"
17746,"- I'm okay.
"
17747,"I got to go to the police station
"
17748,"and look at mug shots.
"
17749,"Thanks for having me over.
"
17750,"Tag, you're going?
"
17751,"We didn't even get a chance to talk.
"
17752,"So where did you say
"
17753,"you're from again?
"
17754,"- Colorado.
"
17755,"- What good are you?
"
17756,"Look, I think we should talk
"
17757,"about what happened on the terrace.
"
17758,"Okay.
"
17759,"I never should've said what I said.
"
17760,"It just doesn't matter how I feel.
"
17761,"We work together, so nothing could
"
17762,"ever happen between us.
"
17763,"I would love to go to work on Monday
"
17764,"and never talk about this again.
"
17765,"Okay. Big day, Monday.
"
17766,"Lots to do.
"
17767,"So we okay?
"
17768,"I'm not.
"
17769,"I freaked you out.
"
17770,"No, you didn't.
"
17771,"What freaked me out was you saying
"
17772,"nothing could happen between us.
"
17773,"- Really?
"
17774,"- Yeah.
"
17775,"So please don't fire me
"
17776,"for doing this.
"
17777,"That's one less thing
"
17778,"we have to do on Monday.
"
17779,"Delaware.
"
17780,"Delaware.
"
17781,"- All right.
"
17782,"- I want my turkey now.
"
17783,"You got it.
"
17784,"You got Nevada twice.
"
17785,"- I know.
"
17786,"- Yeah.
"
17787,"<font color=""#ffff00"" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net
"
17788,"- I'm ready.
"
17789,"- You sure?
"
17790,"Let me just straighten out
"
17791,"your helmet there.
"
17792,"- Thanks, Daddy.
"
17793,"- No, no. One daddy, two mommies.
"
17794,"- All right, it's all yours.
"
17795,"- Okay, okay.
"
17796,"There you go, there you go.
"
17797,"Wow, Ben's first big kid's bike.
"
17798,"This is so exciting!
"
17799,"Oh, yeah, I remember mine.
"
17800,"It was my sixth birthday.
"
17801,"I went to the park...
"
17802,"...and I got on it and it bent.
"
17803,"- Yeah.
"
17804,"- I never had a bike of my own.
"
17805,"- What?
"
17806,"We didn't have a lot of money.
"
17807,"But the girl across the street
"
17808,"had the best bike.
"
17809,"It was pink and it had rainbow-colored
"
17810,"tassels hanging off the handles...
"
17811,"...and a bell
"
17812,"and this big, white wicker basket...
"
17813,"...with those
"
17814,"plastic daisies stuck on.
"
17815,"That sounds like my first bike.
"
17816,"My dad gave me his old one.
"
17817,"- Did the girl ever let you ride it?
"
17818,"- No.
"
17819,"But she gave me the box
"
17820,"that it came in.
"
17821,"It had a picture of the bike
"
17822,"on the front.
"
17823,"So I would sit on it and my stepdad
"
17824,"would drag me around the backyard.
"
17825,"That is so unfair.
"
17826,"Not really, I got
"
17827,"to drag him around too.

"
17831,"Hey, what are you guys doing?
"
17832,"Making candy for the neighbors.
"
17833,"I'm sorry, who?
"
17834,"I'm gonna hang
"
17835,"a basket on the door.
"
17836,"When the neighbors walk by,
"
17837,"they can take a piece.
"
17838,"- But we don't know the neighbors.
"
17839,"- I do.
"
17840,"There's, let's see,
"
17841,"the guy with the mustache...
"
17842,"...smokes-a-lot lady,
"
17843,"some kids I've seen...
"
17844,"...and the red-haired guy
"
17845,"who does not like to be called Rusty.
"
17846,"See, this is exactly why
"
17847,"I'm making this candy.
"
17848,"We can get to know our neighbors.
"
17849,"Wouldn't it be easier
"
17850,"if we just moved?
"
17851,"Good morning!
"
17852,"- Somebody's in a good mood.
"
17853,"- Well, why shouldn't I be?
"
17854,"I have great friends.
"
17855,"I have a wonderful job...
"
17856,"Where you can make out
"
17857,"with your assistant.
"
17858,"It's not a big deal.
"
17859,"We stayed up creating a plan so
"
17860,"that us dating won't be a problem.
"
17861,"Oh, yeah? What's the plan?
"
17862,"We... We are not...
"
17863,"...going to let it...
"
17864,"...be a problem.
"
17865,"It took you all night
"
17866,"to come up with that plan?
"
17867,"Well, you know,
"
17868,"we did other stuff too.
"
17869,"Did you two...?
"
17870,"Oh, I don't sleep with guys
"
17871,"on the first date.
"
17872,"- Matt Wire, Mark Lynn, Ben Wise...
"
17873,"- Anymore!
"
17874,"Hi, Tag, I have a conference call
"
17875,"today, is that correct?
"
17876,"- Yes, at 4.
"
17877,"- Okay, thank you, that'll be all.
"
17878,"Wait, wait.
"
17879,"Did you see that?
"
17880,"He had no idea there was
"
17881,"something going on between us.
"
17882,"- I'd better get back to my desk.
"
17883,"- Okay, hard worker.
"
17884,"I'll put that in your evaluation.
"
17885,"- My what?
"
17886,"- You've been here for two months now.
"
17887,"And your boss is required to hand in
"
17888,"a performance evaluation.
"
17889,"But you know, there is one thing
"
17890,"that I have yet to evaluate.
"
17891,"- Are you serious?
"
17892,"- No, but I've always wanted to do that.
"
17893,"Can you help me clean this up?
"
17894,"The basket is totally empty!
"
17895,"The neighbors ate it all!
"
17896,"Well, either that or... .
"
17897,"Joey!
"
17898,"Yeah?
"
17899,"- Did you eat all the neighbor candy?
"
17900,"- That was the plan.
"
17901,"When I got to it,
"
17902,"there was only a few pieces left.
"
17903,"They've come by all day.
"
17904,"They love it.
"
17905,"They love my candy?
"
17906,"- Oh, man, I gotta go make more.
"
17907,"- Hey, Mon.
"
17908,"Make some more lasagna too. Something
"
17909,"might have happened to a chunk of it.
"
17910,"Ross, the neighbors ate all my candy.
"
17911,"Mine stole my newspaper.
"
17912,"It's like a crime wave.
"
17913,"Pheebs, you got a second?
"
17914,"Sure.
"
17915,"Ever since you told me
"
17916,"about that bike...
"
17917,"...I couldn't stop thinking about it.
"
17918,"I mean, everyone should have
"
17919,"a first bike, you know? So... .
"
17920,"Oh, my God, Ross!
"
17921,"- You like it?
"
17922,"- I love it!
"
17923,"- Yeah?
"
17924,"- Oh, oh, God...
"
17925,"And I love you.
"
17926,"Not that way.
"
17927,"But the bike got you a lot closer.
"
17928,"Well, take it downstairs.
"
17929,"You know, give it a test drive.
"
17930,"Okay. Oh, my God.
"
17931,"My first bike!
"
17932,"Thank you for the best present
"
17933,"I've ever gotten.
"
17934,"You're welcome.
"
17935,"Oh, and Chandler's about to cry.
"
17936,"Am not.
"
17937,"Who is that?
"
17938,"Don't worry, I'm brave.
"
17939,"l... I am brave.
"
17940,"No, no, no, no!
"
17941,"Can you tell me who is there, please?
"
17942,"My name's Gary. I live upstairs.
"
17943,"- Hi.
"
17944,"- Hi.
"
17945,"- Do you know what time it is?
"
17946,"- It's candy time.
"
17947,"My roommate says they taste
"
17948,"like little drops of heaven.
"
17949,"Oh, please.
"
17950,"Did you hear that?
"
17951,"""Little drops of heaven. ""
"
17952,"Four a.m.
"
17953,"So can I get some candy?
"
17954,"I am sorry, but some of us
"
17955,"have to get up early and go to work.
"
17956,"He does not know
"
17957,"that I am not ""some of us. ""
"
17958,"I'm sorry, but I'll put some out
"
17959,"in the morning.
"
17960,"Okay, I'll swing by later.
"
17961,"You live in this building?
"
17962,"Seems like I'd remember you.
"
17963,"Night, Gar.
"
17964,"So did you read your evaluation yet?
"
17965,"No, it was marked ""confidential. ""
"
17966,"I just sent it to human resources.
"
17967,"Please, you're kidding, right?
"
17968,"I wrote that one as a joke for you.
"
17969,"A joke they would appreciate?
"
17970,"I'm thinking, no.
"
17971,"- What did you say?
"
17972,"- I said you were a good kisser...
"
17973,"...and that I liked your
"
17974,"teeny, tiny tushy.
"
17975,"No, not my tushy.
"
17976,"It gets worse.
"
17977,"About your initiative, I wrote:
"
17978,"""He was able to unhook my bra
"
17979,"with minimal supervision. ""
"
17980,"Under problems with performance,
"
17981,"I wrote, ""Dear God, I hope not. ""
"
17982,"And then... And then I drew
"
17983,"a little smiley face.
"
17984,"And then a small pornographic sketch.
"
17985,"That is so sweet of you
"
17986,"to get Phoebe that bike.
"
17987,"When I heard the story,
"
17988,"I almost cried.
"
17989,"Almost cried, huh?
"
17990,"Hear that, Chandler? ""Almost"" cried.
"
17991,"Hey, you cry every time
"
17992,"somebody talks about Titanic. 
"
17993,"Those two had only each other.
"
17994,"She really likes it, huh?
"
17995,"Oh, yeah. I saw her
"
17996,"walking it down the street.
"
17997,"She had these flowers in the basket.
"
17998,"It was so cute.
"
17999,"I saw her this morning,
"
18000,"walking it by the park.
"
18001,"Wait, she was walking the bike?
"
18002,"Both times?
"
18003,"- Hey, Pheebs.
"
18004,"- Oh, hi!
"
18005,"- Hey, so you enjoying the bike?
"
18006,"- Oh, uh-huh, so much.
"
18007,"Pheebs, you do know how
"
18008,"to ride a bike, don't you?
"
18009,"Of course.
"
18010,"Can we see you ride it?
"
18011,"Okay.
"
18012,"See?
"
18013,"I told you not to get
"
18014,"involved with your assistant.
"
18015,"There's no such thing as a secret
"
18016,"when it comes to affairs.
"
18017,"Did you hear that, Chandler?
"
18018,"No such thing.
"
18019,"What happened? I'm just eating candy.
"
18020,"Maybe it's not that bad. They might
"
18021,"not take it the way I meant it.
"
18022,"Absolutely, you know?
"
18023,"Because ""tushy"" can mean both ass...
"
18024,"...and good worker.
"
18025,"I just gotta get the thing back.
"
18026,"Rach? That sketch you mentioned?
"
18027,"Might it have looked
"
18028,"a little like this?
"
18029,"Oh, my God, Joey!
"
18030,"- What is the matter with you?
"
18031,"- God!
"
18032,"This little talent came in handy
"
18033,"before I could afford porn.
"
18034,"Hi, I'm sorry. I know it's
"
18035,"after hours, but I really need candy.
"
18036,"I'm sorry, I can't help you.
"
18037,"See? Rules are rules.
"
18038,"Please, I have people coming
"
18039,"from out of town today.
"
18040,"- I told them all about your candy.
"
18041,"- You're kidding.
"
18042,"Out-of-towners, huh?
"
18043,"What did you tell them?
"
18044,"I told them your candy
"
18045,"was absolutely indescribable.
"
18046,"Some people have said it's ""little
"
18047,"drops of heaven. "" But whatever.
"
18048,"- Please, can't you help me out?
"
18049,"- Hey, Chandler, do we know that lady?
"
18050,"Isn't she the woman who lives
"
18051,"below you and has sex really loud?
"
18052,"All right, I'll do it just this once.
"
18053,"- But you can't tell anyone.
"
18054,"- Please, just give it to me.
"
18055,"Yeah, that's her.
"
18056,"- Thank you.
"
18057,"- Unbelievable!
"
18058,"I can't believe that sign didn't work.
"
18059,"You know what would work?
"
18060,"Stop making candy.
"
18061,"But they like it.
"
18062,"You mean they like you.
"
18063,"Maybe.
"
18064,"Is that why you became a chef,
"
18065,"so people would like you?
"
18066,"You want to talk about getting
"
18067,"people to like you, huh, funny man?
"
18068,"Just remember everything
"
18069,"I taught you and you'll be fine.
"
18070,"Okay? Here we go.
"
18071,"Ready, set...
"
18072,"Wait, this seat
"
18073,"is really uncomfortable.
"
18074,"Maybe before we start
"
18075,"we should just get another one.
"
18076,"Perhaps like an airplane seat,
"
18077,"or a beanbag chair!
"
18078,"You can't get out of this.
"
18079,"You have to learn how to ride a bike.
"
18080,"Why? Why do I have to learn?
"
18081,"- Well, in case of an emergency.
"
18082,"- What kind of emergency?
"
18083,"Well, what if a man comes along
"
18084,"and puts a gun to your head and says:
"
18085,"""You ride this bike or I'll...
"
18086,"I'll shoot you. ""
"
18087,"I would ring the bell to distract him.
"
18088,"Then I would knock the gun away
"
18089,"with a Chinese throwing star.
"
18090,"Okay, Phoebe, just get on the bike...
"
18091,"...and, hey, I'll hold you up
"
18092,"and push you. Okay?
"
18093,"You won't let go?
"
18094,"- No.
"
18095,"- You swear?
"
18096,"I swear.
"
18097,"- Okay.
"
18098,"- Come on.
"
18099,"Here we go. All right?
"
18100,"All right?
"
18101,"Feel good?
"
18102,"All right, try pedaling.
"
18103,"That's it, you're doing great.
"
18104,"Yes, take control.
"
18105,"Yes, yes, yes!
"
18106,"Oh, no!
"
18107,"You swore!
"
18108,"- I just thought you were doing so well.
"
18109,"- I am shocked. Shocked!
"
18110,"It's a legitimate learning technique.
"
18111,"Wow.
"
18112,"Hey, there's some people outside
"
18113,"asking about candy.
"
18114,"They'll just have to wait, okay?
"
18115,"I only got two hands!
"
18116,"- Need some help?
"
18117,"- No, you don't know the system.
"
18118,"I don't need nobody messing
"
18119,"with the system!
"
18120,"By the way, the week before your
"
18121,"wedding, you may not see a lot of me.
"
18122,"Oh, hello, liar.
"
18123,"Look, I'm really sorry
"
18124,"I let go of the bike.
"
18125,"I could've been killed, you know.
"
18126,"I know, I know.
"
18127,"But can we please try it again?
"
18128,"I mean, you were so close, Phoebe.
"
18129,"Well, I would love to...
"
18130,"...but the bike got stolen
"
18131,"and the police have no suspects.
"
18132,"- Phoebe.
"
18133,"- What?
"
18134,"What the hell?
"
18135,"You know what?
"
18136,"If you won't learn how to ride,
"
18137,"then I'm sorry...
"
18138,"...I have to take it back.
"
18139,"- But why?
"
18140,"Because it's... .
"
18141,"It'd be like you having this guitar...
"
18142,"...and never playing it.
"
18143,"Okay, this guitar wants to be played.
"
18144,"And this bike wants to be ridden.
"
18145,"And if you don't ride it...
"
18146,"...you're killing its spirit.
"
18147,"The bike...
"
18148,"...is dying.
"
18149,"All right. If you care enough
"
18150,"to make up that load of crap, okay.
"
18151,"Great.
"
18152,"You're making the bike very happy.
"
18153,"Okay, Ross.
"
18154,"Please don't die!
"
18155,"To get the evaluation
"
18156,"before they see it...
"
18157,"...we gotta get into Zelner's office.
"
18158,"He doesn't get in until 10.
"
18159,"But his assistant, Betty, comes in
"
18160,"early to eat breakfast at her desk.
"
18161,"- That's kind of sad.
"
18162,"- Yeah, well, Betty's kind of sad.
"
18163,"Which is why I believe I can lure
"
18164,"her away with these chocolates.
"
18165,"While I distract her, you go in.
"
18166,"- Got it.
"
18167,"- Let's roll.
"
18168,"Hello, Rachel. You got a minute?
"
18169,"Yeah, sure, Mr. Zelner.
"
18170,"For you? Anything. Minute.
"
18171,"Okay, great.
"
18172,"Abort the plan.
"
18173,"Actually, I'd like to speak
"
18174,"to both of you.
"
18175,"Okay.
"
18176,"Well, can we get you anything,
"
18177,"Mr. Zelner? Maybe some chocolates.
"
18178,"No, thanks,
"
18179,"but I'll give these to Betty.
"
18180,"So, I read your evaluation of Tag.
"
18181,"Or, to use his full name,
"
18182,"Tag ""Sweet Cheeks"" Jones?
"
18183,"Is something going on with you two?
"
18184,"Oh, my God,
"
18185,"can you imagine if there was?
"
18186,"I mean, what would happen exactly?
"
18187,"Well, I'd be forced to file a report.
"
18188,"I'd have to consult
"
18189,"with the legal department.
"
18190,"And your future at the company
"
18191,"would be in jeopardy.
"
18192,"- Well...
"
18193,"- Mr. Zelner... .
"
18194,"I filled in that evaluation.
"
18195,"- Oh, no...
"
18196,"- Yeah, yeah.
"
18197,"I thought it would be funny.
"
18198,"You wrote that you have a cute tushy?
"
18199,"Yes.
"
18200,"I have a weird sense of humor.
"
18201,"And I'm kind of strangely
"
18202,"proud of my butt.
"
18203,"It's kind of a risky joke, Tag.
"
18204,"What is this drawing?
"
18205,"I can't figure it out.
"
18206,"It's upside down, you gotta...
"
18207,"It doesn't matter.
"
18208,"It's not like I don't have
"
18209,"a sense of humor.
"
18210,"Hell, I even enjoy a
"
18211,"naughty limerick every now and then.
"
18212,"There's a time and a place.
"
18213,"Unless you have a limerick right now.
"
18214,"No? Okay.
"
18215,"Well, you've got my fax number.
"
18216,"I can't believe you did that.
"
18217,"That was sweet.
"
18218,"- Don't worry about it.
"
18219,"- You could've lost your job.
"
18220,"Are you kidding me? With this
"
18221,"cute butt, I'd find work.
"
18222,"Thank you, you're great.
"
18223,"- You know what?
"
18224,"- What?
"
18225,"I feel great.
"
18226,"In fact... .
"
18227,"What?
"
18228,"It's just... It took me so long
"
18229,"to get that desk organized.
"
18230,"I'm sorry.
"
18231,"There it is.
"
18232,"What is going on?
"
18233,"We're waiting for the candy.
"
18234,"Bring out the candy!
"
18235,"Yeah, lady, give us candy.
"
18236,"Joey!
"
18237,"- What's up, buddy?
"
18238,"- What are you doing?
"
18239,"Waiting to get candy.
"
18240,"Get in here.
"
18241,"Hey, and you cannot smoke in here.
"
18242,"Merry Christmas.
"
18243,"The candy is coming! I need
"
18244,"another 15 minutes for it to cool.
"
18245,"All right, everybody, just be quiet.
"
18246,"Be quiet! Be quiet! Pipe down!
"
18247,"What is the matter with you people?
"
18248,"This woman was trying to do a nice
"
18249,"thing for you.
"
18250,"She was making candy
"
18251,"so she could get to know all of you...
"
18252,"...and I'll bet that not one of you
"
18253,"can tell me her name.
"
18254,"Am I right?
"
18255,"Candy Lady?
"
18256,"No, not ""Candy Lady. ""
"
18257,"If we know it, can we have candy?
"
18258,"All right, you know what?
"
18259,"Forget it, you've ruined it.
"
18260,"Go home. You've ruined it.
"
18261,"That's all wrong! You guys
"
18262,"ruined everything. You ruined it!
"
18263,"- Thank you.
"
18264,"- You're welcome.
"
18265,"Did you smoke?
"
18266,"No, smokes-a-lot lady blew smoke
"
18267,"directly into my mouth.
"
18268,"Are you okay?
"
18269,"Fine, but it was
"
18270,"really scary for a while.
"
18271,"Someone slipped a threatening
"
18272,"note under the door!
"
18273,"Oh, yeah. Sorry about that.
"
18274,"Mob mentality or whatever.
"
18275,"I can't believe it. I did it.
"
18276,"I rode a bike!
"
18277,"I never thought I'd be able
"
18278,"to do that. Thank you.
"
18279,"Oh, hey, don't thank me.
"
18280,"Thank yourself.
"
18281,"You're the one who faced your fears
"
18282,"and ultimately overcame them.
"
18283,"Don't be so corny, Ross.
"
18284,"It's not an After School Special.
"
18285,"<font color=""#ffff00"" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net

18286,"Bye-bye.
"
18287,"I just got reservations

18289,"...and tickets to The Music Man

"
18291,"...our first holiday
"
18292,"as a betrothed couple.
"
18293,"- ""Betrothed. ""
"
18294,"- Betrothed couple.
"
18295,"Pheebs?
"
18296,"Skull?
"
18297,"Yeah, it's my mom's.
"
18298,"Oh, my God!
"
18299,"No, no, no. It's not my mom.
"
18300,"It belonged to my mom.
"
18301,"She used to put it out
"
18302,"every Christmas...
"
18303,"...to remind us that even though
"
18304,"it's Christmas, people still die.
"
18305,"And you can put candy in it.
"
18306,"Licorice?
"
18307,"Sure.
"
18308,"- I get Ben for the holidays this year.
"
18309,"- That's great!
"
18310,"- Are you gonna dress up as Santa?
"
18311,"- Nope.
"
18312,"I know Susan does every year.
"
18313,"I want to take this year
"
18314,"to teach him about Hanukkah.
"
18315,"And maybe I could teach Ben...
"
18316,"...about the Christmas skull
"
18317,"and how people die.
"
18318,"You may need to use this year
"
18319,"to teach Ben about Phoebe.
"
18320,"- Did you know he was in there?
"
18321,"- No.
"
18322,"- How long have we been home?
"
18323,"- About half an hour.
"
18324,"Lovely.

"
18331,"No.
"
18332,"Why not?
"
18333,"Bing's weird.
"
18334,"Oh, hey, you guys.
"
18335,"My landlord just called.
"
18336,"My apartment's gonna be ready soon.
"
18337,"I guess I'll be moving out.
"
18338,"Phoebe, I'm gonna miss you.
"
18339,"Yes, you will be very sad.
"
18340,"- I gotta go tell Rachel the good news.
"
18341,"- You'll be living together again?
"
18342,"- Why not?
"
18343,"- She's having so much fun with Joey...
"
18344,"...I assumed she'd still
"
18345,"be living with him.
"
18346,"Why do you think
"
18347,"she's having so much fun?
"
18348,"No reason, except she...
"
18349,"...told me.
"
18350,"She said she didn't want
"
18351,"to live with me?
"
18352,"No. No, she didn't say that.
"
18353,"I think you should talk to Monica now.
"
18354,"Phoebe, I'm sure
"
18355,"she wants to live with you.
"
18356,"You're absolutely sure?
"
18357,"No, but I'll bet she probably does.
"
18358,"Oh, probably?
"
18359,"I don't like that word.
"
18360,"I know what ""probably"" really means.
"
18361,"Yeah, yeah.
"
18362,"""Oh, your mom
"
18363,"probably won't kill herself. ""
"
18364,"I'm sorry,
"
18365,"but I'm not hanging my hopes...
"
18366,"...of Rachel and I living together
"
18367,"on ""probably. ""
"
18368,"You gotta take care of yourself
"
18369,"in this world.
"
18370,"History teaches us nothing.
"
18371,"Bing doesn't seem so weird now,
"
18372,"does it?
"
18373,"You're home.
"
18374,"Guess what Phoebe got me
"
18375,"for Christmas?
"
18376,"- Drums?
"
18377,"- No, drums!
"
18378,"Could we get
"
18379,"two burritos to go, please?
"
18380,"I'm sorry. But not that sorry,
"
18381,"you don't have to live with it.
"
18382,"We have a reservation under Bing.
"
18383,"Okay, we'll have a table for you
"
18384,"in about 45 minutes.
"
18385,"We have tickets
"
18386,"to The Music Man at 8.
"
18387,"I'm sorry.
"
18388,"Christmas is a very busy time, sir.
"
18389,"Is this because of the burrito thing?
"
18390,"- You need to give him money.
"
18391,"- It was a joke!
"
18392,"To get a table. Places like this
"
18393,"are always shaking you down.
"
18394,"- Everybody wants a payoff.
"
18395,"- All right, calm down, O'Malley.
"
18396,"- I'll slip him some money.
"
18397,"- But you've got to be smooth.
"
18398,"Hey, I can be smooth.
"
18399,"We're in a hurry.
"
18400,"If you could get us a table...
"
18401,"...a bit quicker, I'd appreciate it.
"
18402,"- Of course, sir.
"
18403,"- Okay.
"
18404,"- How'd it go?
"
18405,"- Had the money in the wrong hand.
"
18406,"You don't feel...
"
18407,"...like you're gonna throw up?
"
18408,"- No.
"
18409,"Well, I do. So let's... .
"
18410,"So, Ben, you... .
"
18411,"You know what holiday is coming up?
"
18412,"Christmas.
"
18413,"Yeah, and you know what
"
18414,"other holiday is coming up?
"
18415,"Christmas Eve.
"
18416,"Yes, but also... .
"
18417,"Hanukkah!
"
18418,"See, you're part Jewish
"
18419,"and Hanukkah is a Jewish holiday.
"
18420,"Santa has reindeers that can fly.
"
18421,"Right, but on Hanukkah...
"
18422,"Hanukkah is a celebration
"
18423,"of a miracle.
"
18424,"Years and years ago there were
"
18425,"these people called the Maccabees.
"
18426,"Okay, that's right. Yes...
"
18427,"...but on Hanukkah, we sing:
"
18428,"Okay, it's not a contest.
"
18429,"When is Santa coming?
"
18430,"How about this year,
"
18431,"instead of Santa...
"
18432,"...we have fun celebrating Hanukkah?
"
18433,"No Santa?
"
18434,"Was I bad?
"
18435,"No, no, no, you weren't bad.
"
18436,"You've been very good, Ben.
"
18437,"- Santa's mad at me.
"
18438,"- No, hey, hey, come on.
"
18439,"Ben, Santa is not mad at you, okay?
"
18440,"You're his favorite little guy.
"
18441,"So Santa's coming?
"
18442,"Yes!
"
18443,"Santa's coming.
"
18444,"It's easy. Just keep it casual.
"
18445,"Shake his hand and give him the money.
"
18446,"- How do you know so much about this?
"
18447,"- I don't know.
"
18448,"Richard used to do it, didn't he?
"
18449,"We'd be eating our soup right now.
"
18450,"Mustached bastard.
"
18451,"Those people just left. Come on.
"
18452,"Quick, give him the money.
"
18453,"Excuse me.
"
18454,"So you like the drums.
"
18455,"That's great.
"
18456,"I was worried that
"
18457,"they would create maybe...
"
18458,"...an unbearable living situation.
"
18459,"But, okay, well, apparently not.
"
18460,"So, yay!
"
18461,"Hey, we already learned a song.
"
18462,"Ready? One, two, three, four.
"
18463,"Tequila!
"
18464,"That's fun.
"
18465,"Here you go.
"
18466,"Thank you, Gunther.
"
18467,"Put her there.
"
18468,"Definitely not easier with coins.
"
18469,"- Thank you.
"
18470,"- Thank you.
"
18471,"Hey, Pheebs.
"
18472,"Here. Now I only owe you $49.50.
"
18473,"Hey, Pheebs...
"
18474,"...if you want to get Joey a gift
"
18475,"that disrupts the entire building...
"
18476,"...why not something more subtle...
"
18477,"...like a wrecking ball...
"
18478,"...or a vial of small pox
"
18479,"to release in the hallway?
"
18480,"It's not just the drum noise.
"
18481,"Every five minutes...
"
18482,"...Joey throws his sticks
"
18483,"in the air...
"
18484,"...and I have to hear:
"
18485,"""Oh, my eye! Oh, God, my eye! ""
"
18486,"- I mean, it's so annoying.
"
18487,"- Yes, thank you.
"
18488,"You see, this is how normal people
"
18489,"are supposed to react to drums.
"
18490,"You got Joey drums to annoy Rachel...
"
18491,"...so she wouldn't want
"
18492,"to live there anymore?
"
18493,"Maybe on some level.
"
18494,"You could just not throw the sticks
"
18495,"up in the air.
"
18496,"What is rock 'n' roll about that?
"
18497,"Hey, Joey, I got you another present.
"
18498,"Hold it!
"
18499,"Before you tell me what it is... .
"
18500,"Okay, what is it?
"
18501,"It's a...
"
18502,"...tarantula!
"
18503,"God, Rachel, I'm sorry.
"
18504,"What was I thinking...
"
18505,"...giving Joey this big, gross,
"
18506,"scary spider...
"
18507,"...in such a poorly constructed cage?
"
18508,"What are you talking about?
"
18509,"I love them.
"
18510,"I had a tarantula when I was a kid.
"
18511,"But it died because my cat ate it.
"
18512,"And then my cat died.
"
18513,"But, Joey, isn't this cool?
"
18514,"Is it on me?
"
18515,"I feel like it's on me. I got...
"
18516,"Oh, isn't that adorable?
"
18517,"Joey is afraid of the tarantula.
"
18518,"He's so adorable.
"
18519,"He's so much fun.
"
18520,"I'm glad you're having
"
18521,"so much fun here.
"
18522,"Wait a minute.
"
18523,"What's the matter?
"
18524,"Our apartment is ready.
"
18525,"And that makes you angry because...?
"
18526,"Because you'd rather
"
18527,"live here with Joey.
"
18528,"- Where did you get that?
"
18529,"- Monica and Chandler...
"
18530,"...said you were having
"
18531,"so much fun here...
"
18532,"...and apparently no amount of drums
"
18533,"or tarantula is gonna change that.
"
18534,"Did you get all this stuff for Joey...
"
18535,"...to try to drive me out
"
18536,"of the apartment?
"
18537,"You might as well
"
18538,"have gotten him a fish.
"
18539,"You know how fish freak me out.
"
18540,"Fish.
"
18541,"But it wouldn't have mattered.
"
18542,"We're gonna live together.
"
18543,"That's the deal.
"
18544,"Yes, but I wanted you to want
"
18545,"to live with me.
"
18546,"But if you're having
"
18547,"so much fun over here...
"
18548,"It's so much more fun with you.
"
18549,"- We did have fun, didn't we?
"
18550,"- We did.
"
18551,"They say, if we want,
"
18552,"we could see it tonight.
"
18553,"- I would love to.
"
18554,"- Yay, okay!
"
18555,"- Good, good, good.
"
18556,"- Great. All right. Good.
"
18557,"And Monica asked me
"
18558,"to make the drumming stop.
"
18559,"Done.
"
18560,"Hello, sir.
"
18561,"You here to return those pants?
"
18562,"No, these are my pants.
"
18563,"Okay.
"
18564,"- How can I help you?
"
18565,"- Do you have a Santa outfit left?
"
18566,"Two days before Christmas?
"
18567,"Sorry, man.
"
18568,"Okay, look.
"
18569,"Do you have anything Christmas-y?
"
18570,"I promised my son, and I really
"
18571,"don't want to disappoint him.
"
18572,"Come on, you gotta have something.
"
18573,"I'm the Holiday Armadillo!
"
18574,"I'm a friend of Santa's...
"
18575,"...and he sent me here to wish you...
"
18576,"...a merry Christmas!
"
18577,"What happened to Santa,
"
18578,"Holiday Armadillo?
"
18579,"Santa was unavailable...
"
18580,"...so close to Christmas.
"
18581,"Come in, have a seat.
"
18582,"You must be exhausted,
"
18583,"coming all the way from Texas.
"
18584,"- Texas?
"
18585,"- That's right, Ben.
"
18586,"I'm Santa's representative...
"
18587,"...for all the Southern states.
"
18588,"And Mexico!
"
18589,"But Santa sent me here...
"
18590,"...to give you these presents, Ben.
"
18591,"Maybe the lady will help me
"
18592,"with these presents.
"
18593,"Wow, thanks!
"
18594,"You're welcome, Ben.
"
18595,"Merry Christmas.
"
18596,"And happy Hanukkah!
"
18597,"Are you for Hanukkah too?
"
18598,"Because I'm part Jewish.
"
18599,"You are? Me too.
"
18600,"Because armadillos
"
18601,"also wandered in the desert?
"
18602,"You want to wander in the hall?
"
18603,"Hey, Ben!
"
18604,"What if the Holiday Armadillo...
"
18605,"...told you all about
"
18606,"the Festival of Lights?
"
18607,"Cool!
"
18608,"Come on, Ben.
"
18609,"Years and years ago...
"
18610,"...there were these people called...
"
18611,"...the Maccabees!
"
18612,"- Ho, ho, ho!
"
18613,"Merry Christmas!
"
18614,"Santa!
"
18615,"What are you doing here, Santa?
"
18616,"Well, I'm here to see
"
18617,"my old buddy, Ben.
"
18618,"What are you doing here...
"
18619,"...Weird Turtle Man?
"
18620,"I'm the Holiday Armadillo...
"
18621,"...your part-Jewish friend.
"
18622,"You sent me here
"
18623,"to give Ben some presents.
"
18624,"Remember?
"
18625,"What?
"
18626,"Did you bring me any presents, Santa?
"
18627,"You bet I did, Ben.
"
18628,"Put her there.
"
18629,"Well, it would have worked this time
"
18630,"if his hands weren't so damn small.
"
18631,"Ho, ho, ho!
"
18632,"Ben, come open more gifts.
"
18633,"The armadillo and I
"
18634,"will have a talk in the kitchen.
"
18635,"There's a sentence
"
18636,"I never thought I'd say.
"
18637,"What are you doing?
"
18638,"You said you were having trouble
"
18639,"finding a Santa costume...
"
18640,"...so I borrowed one
"
18641,"from a guy at work.
"
18642,"Thank you, but you gotta leave.
"
18643,"- Why?
"
18644,"- Because...
"
18645,"...I'm finally getting him excited
"
18646,"about Hanukkah...
"
18647,"...and you're wrecking it.
"
18648,"But I didn't get to shake my belly
"
18649,"like a bowlful of jelly.
"
18650,"I'm sorry, Chandler,
"
18651,"but this is really important to me.
"
18652,"Fine, I'll give the suit back.
"
18653,"Hey, you think you can keep it
"
18654,"another night?
"
18655,"Santa, really?
"
18656,"Yeah, is that okay?
"
18657,"Did your dad ever dress up like Santa?
"
18658,"- No.
"
18659,"- Then it's okay!
"
18660,"Okay, Ben. Santa has to go.
"
18661,"Say goodbye.
"
18662,"No, why does he have to go?
"
18663,"Because if Santa and the Holiday...
"
18664,"...Armadillo...
"
18665,"...are ever in the same room
"
18666,"for too long...
"
18667,"...the universe will implode!
"
18668,"Merry Christmas!
"
18669,"No, why can't the armadillo leave?
"
18670,"I want Santa.
"
18671,"Fine, I give up. Santa...
"
18672,"Santa can stay!
"
18673,"Well, I'll stay...
"
18674,"...but only because I want to hear
"
18675,"about Hanukkah.
"
18676,"Ben, will you sit here with Santa...
"
18677,"...and learn about Hanukkah?
"
18678,"Okay, Santa.
"
18679,"- Thank you.
"
18680,"- You're welcome.
"
18681,"All right, it's time...
"
18682,"...for the story of Hanukkah.
"
18683,"Years and years ago...
"
18684,"...there were these people
"
18685,"called the Maccabees!
"
18686,"Merry Christmas!
"
18687,"Oh, wow, look at this place!
"
18688,"Oh, this is terrible.
"
18689,"They've made so many changes...
"
18690,"...I can't even feel
"
18691,"my grandmother's presence anymore.
"
18692,"Oh, new sconces!
"
18693,"- Oh, my God!
"
18694,"- What?
"
18695,"Remember how you told me
"
18696,"your grandmother put up that wall...
"
18697,"...to make that into two bedrooms?
"
18698,"- Yeah.
"
18699,"And that the landlord
"
18700,"might find out...
"
18701,"...and then tear it down?
"
18702,"- Yeah?
"
18703,"Do you really not know
"
18704,"where I'm going?
"
18705,"It left. It's one huge room.
"
18706,"Oh, no!
"
18707,"Wow!
"
18708,"See?
"
18709,"I guess we'll have to
"
18710,"put the wall back up.
"
18711,"- You can't, with the new skylight.
"
18712,"- There's a skylight?
"
18713,"Wow!
"
18714,"So should we start looking
"
18715,"for a new place?
"
18716,"You know, I'm sensing...
"
18717,"...that my grandmother
"
18718,"would not be comfortable with that.
"
18719,"Oh, yeah?
"
18720,"Starting to feel her again there,
"
18721,"are we?
"
18722,"- A little bit. Yeah.
"
18723,"- Yeah.
"
18724,"Is your grandmother maybe saying
"
18725,"that you should live here alone?
"
18726,"You heard it too? You have the gift.
"
18727,"Phoebe, it's okay.
"
18728,"I like living with Joey.
"
18729,"- Are you sure?
"
18730,"- Please. I hate packing...
"
18731,"...it's closer to work.
"
18732,"And we do have fun.
"
18733,"Although, I'm really gonna miss
"
18734,"living with you.
"
18735,"- Oh, me too.
"
18736,"- I know.
"
18737,"Did you hear that?
"
18738,"I'm getting something
"
18739,"from your grandmother.
"
18740,"She said since you get to keep
"
18741,"the one-bedroom apartment...
"
18742,"...you should give Rachel
"
18743,"the purple chair.
"
18744,"No, I do not hear that.
"
18745,"And the miracle was that
"
18746,"that little bit of oil...
"
18747,"...that should have lasted
"
18748,"just one day, burned for... .
"
18749,"- Eight whole days.
"
18750,"- That's right.
"
18751,"And that's why we celebrate
"
18752,"Hanukkah today. The end.
"
18753,"- Awesome.
"
18754,"- Yeah.
"
18755,"My favorite part...
"
18756,"...was when Superman
"
18757,"flew all the Jews out of Egypt.
"
18758,"The armadillo was actually
"
18759,"not so thrilled about that part.
"
18760,"Okay, Ben, it's time to light...
"
18761,"...the Hanukkah candles!
"
18762,"Wow! Looks like the Easter Bunny's
"
18763,"funeral in here.
"
18764,"Come on, come on.
"
18765,"We're lighting the candles.
"
18766,"I understand why Superman is here...
"
18767,"...but why is there a porcupine
"
18768,"at the Easter Bunny's funeral?
"
18769,"- You get it?
"
18770,"- I got it.
"
18771,"Back in the cage?
"
18772,"It's back in the cage.
"
18773,"Is the cage closed?
"
18774,"Joey, will you just come out here
"
18775,"and stop being such a baby!

"
18777,"You have got to try this cheesecake.
"
18778,"You know, I'm not that much
"
18779,"of a sweet tooth...
"
18780,"Oh, my God, it's so creamy!
"
18781,"That's the best
"
18782,"cheesecake I've ever had!
"
18783,"Where did you get this?
"
18784,"It was at the front door when I got
"
18785,"home. Somebody sent it to us.
"
18786,"This isn't addressed to you.
"
18787,"This is addressed
"
18788,"to Mrs. Braverman downstairs!
"
18789,"Thief!
"
18790,"I didn't read the box
"
18791,"before I opened it...
"
18792,"...and you can't return a box
"
18793,"after you opened it!
"
18794,"- Why not?
"
18795,"- Because it's too delicious!
"
18796,"You stole this cheesecake.
"
18797,"That's wrong.
"
18798,"No, it'll be okay because Mrs. Braverman
"
18799,"will send for a free one.
"
18800,"That way, we all win.
"
18801,"The only losers are the
"
18802,"big cheesecake conglomerate...
"
18803,"...""Mama's Little Bakery. ""
"
18804,"I feel terrible.
"
18805,"I'm a horrible, horrible person.
"
18806,"I'm sorry, what?
"
18807,"The One With All The Cheesecakes
"
18808,"English Subtitles by

"
18810,"I should get going. Big day at work.
"
18811,"You know how I'm in a coma?
"
18812,"Today they do a test on me and it
"
18813,"turns out I'm not brain-dead.
"
18814,"So...
"
18815,"Mr. Smarty Pants.
"
18816,"It's just my character
"
18817,"that's not brain-dead.
"
18818,"Pheebs, still on for tonight?
"
18819,"- Absolutely.
"
18820,"- I'll see you at 8.
"
18821,"What's at 8?
"
18822,"Dinner. We get together about once
"
18823,"a month to discuss the rest of you.
"
18824,"Wow! Did not know that.
"
18825,"May I say how lovely you look today?
"
18826,"Duly noted.
"
18827,"So for tomorrow, do you want to
"
18828,"rent a car and drive down together?
"
18829,"- What are you talking about?
"
18830,"- Cousin Frannie's wedding.
"
18831,"You were invited?
"
18832,"No.
"
18833,"Oh, my God, I can't believe this.
"
18834,"I thought only Mom and Dad
"
18835,"were invited.
"
18836,"From the ages of 7 to 9,
"
18837,"Frannie and I were inseparable.
"
18838,"Maybe since the age of 9,
"
18839,"Frannie's made some new friends.
"
18840,"It's probably just a mistake.
"
18841,"Let me call Aunt Cheryl.
"
18842,"Maybe you are invited and the
"
18843,"invitation got lost in the mail.
"
18844,"You call her and tell her
"
18845,"that when we were kids...
"
18846,"...her precious Frannie
"
18847,"tried to undress me several times.
"
18848,"If I hadn't stopped her, there
"
18849,"wouldn't be a wedding to go to.
"
18850,"She tried to undress me too.
"
18851,"I used to undress my cousin Glenn.
"
18852,"Joseph Francis Tribbiani,
"
18853,"are you home yet?
"
18854,"I think he's still out.
"
18855,"What's wrong?
"
18856,"I'll tell you, Rachel Karen Greene.
"
18857,"I had plans with Joey,
"
18858,"and he left me this note.
"
18859,"""Pheebs, can't make it.
"
18860,"Got a date. Talk to you later.
"
18861,"Big Daddy. ""
"
18862,"- ""Big Daddy""?
"
18863,"- That's a nickname we were trying.
"
18864,"You know what nickname
"
18865,"never caught on? ""The Ross-a-tron. ""
"
18866,"Here's Joseph Francis!
"
18867,"Wait, what are you
"
18868,"middle-naming me for?
"
18869,"I left you a note.
"
18870,"That doesn't give you the
"
18871,"right to ditch me!
"
18872,"You can cancel plans with friends
"
18873,"if there's a possibility for sex.
"
18874,"He's right. That is the rule.
"
18875,"I don't accept it. When we make
"
18876,"plans, I expect you to show up.
"
18877,"I'm not a way to kill time
"
18878,"till you meet someone better.
"
18879,"Boyfriends and girlfriends will
"
18880,"come and go, but this is for life.
"
18881,"I'm so sorry. I had no idea
"
18882,"it would bother you this much.
"
18883,"Well, it does.
"
18884,"Well, can I make it up to you?
"
18885,"I'm sorry.
"
18886,"How about dinner tomorrow night?
"
18887,"I'll pay for myself.
"
18888,"Okay, you wore me down.
"
18889,"While you're over there, how
"
18890,"about a beer for ""The Ross-a-tron""?
"
18891,"""Ross..."" Is that back?
"
18892,"The other cheesecake came.
"
18893,"They delivered it here again.
"
18894,"Just bring it downstairs.
"
18895,"What's the problem?
"
18896,"I can't seem to say goodbye.
"
18897,"Are you serious?
"
18898,"We ate an entire cake
"
18899,"two days ago and you want more?
"
18900,"Well, I've forgotten
"
18901,"what it tastes like.
"
18902,"It was cheesecake. It was fine.
"
18903,"It had a buttery, crumbly,
"
18904,"graham cracker crust...
"
18905,"...with a very rich...
"
18906,"...yet light cream cheese filling.
"
18907,"Wow, my whole mouth
"
18908,"just filled with saliva.
"
18909,"Know what? Forget it.
"
18910,"We're just hungry.
"
18911,"We haven't had lunch.
"
18912,"We're just lightheaded.
"
18913,"So let's go have lunch
"
18914,"and forget about the cheesecake.
"
18915,"We'll drop it off
"
18916,"so we're not tempted.
"
18917,"- Where do you want to eat?
"
18918,"- Mama's Little Bakery, Chicago.
"
18919,"Mel Tormï¿½ died.
"
18920,"Joey, that paper's like a year old.
"
18921,"Does that mean the Sam Goody's sale
"
18922,"is over?
"
18923,"So, I finally heard back
"
18924,"from Aunt Cheryl...
"
18925,"...and apparently it wasn't a mistake.
"
18926,"There's limited seating...
"
18927,"Limited seating? I am just
"
18928,"one tiny person!
"
18929,"Yeah, but she doesn't know that.
"
18930,"I mean, the last time she saw you...
"
18931,"...you'd have turned one of those
"
18932,"little wedding chairs into kindling.
"
18933,"""Limited seating. ""
"
18934,"That's such a lame excuse.
"
18935,"That's not the reason
"
18936,"she's not inviting me.
"
18937,"What's the big deal? I wasn't invited
"
18938,"to the ceremony, just the reception.
"
18939,"If it makes you feel any better, Joan
"
18940,"and I will just make an appearance...
"
18941,"...and then we'll leave early
"
18942,"as a sign of protest.
"
18943,"- Joan?
"
18944,"- Yeah, my date.
"
18945,"Assistant professor in linguistics.
"
18946,"Tall, very beautiful.
"
18947,"And despite what some people say,
"
18948,"not broad-backed.
"
18949,"Wait a minute.
"
18950,"You got ""Ross Geller and Guest""?
"
18951,"I wasn't invited,
"
18952,"and you got ""and Guest""?
"
18953,"Excuse me, I do have to interrupt
"
18954,"on Ross' behalf.
"
18955,"I think the rule applies here.
"
18956,"Since he has a chance
"
18957,"to get on broad-back...
"
18958,"Not broad-back!
"
18959,"Wait a minute. You're bringing me.
"
18960,"I can't cancel on Joan.
"
18961,"- Why not?
"
18962,"- Did you not hear me?
"
18963,"She's an assistant professor
"
18964,"in the linguistics department.
"
18965,"They're wild.
"
18966,"- Why do you want to come anyway?
"
18967,"- Because...
"
18968,"...she's my cousin.
"
18969,"I mean, we grew up together.
"
18970,"Family, you know?
"
18971,"And all that's important to me.
"
18972,"Okay, all right. I'll take you.
"
18973,"I'll go call Joan.
"
18974,"Oh, that's nice.
"
18975,"Family should be there.
"
18976,"It's her wedding.
"
18977,"Happiest day of her life.
"
18978,"We'll see.
"
18979,"Well, thank you for lunch.
"
18980,"Wait, I thought you paid.
"
18981,"Apparently, we don't pay
"
18982,"for food anymore.
"
18983,"- Do you see what I see?
"
18984,"- It's still there.
"
18985,"Mrs. Braverman must be out.
"
18986,"She could be out of town.
"
18987,"Maybe gone for months.
"
18988,"By then, it may spoil.
"
18989,"She can't come back to bad cheesecake.
"
18990,"- It could kill her.
"
18991,"- Don't want that.
"
18992,"We're protecting her.
"
18993,"- We'll take it.
"
18994,"- But quick.
"
18995,"- Why?
"
18996,"- I hear her in there.
"
18997,"Go! Go! Go!
"
18998,"Oh, my God, that's David.
"
18999,"- Who?
"
19000,"- David, the scientist guy.
"
19001,"David that I was in love with.
"
19002,"Who went to Russia
"
19003,"and broke my heart, David.
"
19004,"Oh, my God!
"
19005,"Say their name enough,
"
19006,"they turn around.
"
19007,"Phoebe.
"
19008,"David.
"
19009,"What are you doing?
"
19010,"Aren't you supposed to be in Russia?
"
19011,"I'm just in town for a conference.
"
19012,"God, you look phenomenal.
"
19013,"Well... .
"
19014,"Yeah.
"
19015,"You look great too.
"
19016,"Did you get a haircut?
"
19017,"Yeah. Well, I got like 30 of them.
"
19018,"Look, I got a confession to make.
"
19019,"I was hoping to run into you here.
"
19020,"I didn't know if I should call.
"
19021,"I was only in town a few days...
"
19022,"...and I didn't want to intrude
"
19023,"on your life.
"
19024,"I really wanted to see you...
"
19025,"...but I didn't know
"
19026,"if you wanted to see me.
"
19027,"Of course I would want to see you.
"
19028,"I think about you all the time.
"
19029,"Really? Because I think about you
"
19030,"all the time.
"
19031,"There's a statue in Minsk
"
19032,"that reminds me of you so much.
"
19033,"It's actually of Lenin...
"
19034,"...but, you know, at certain angles... .
"
19035,"Anyway, do you want
"
19036,"to have dinner tonight?
"
19037,"Yes.
"
19038,"Oh, no!
"
19039,"- What?
"
19040,"- I can't.
"
19041,"I can't believe I have plans.
"
19042,"Can you do it tomorrow?
"
19043,"No, I have to go in a few hours.
"
19044,"I have to be on the redeye.
"
19045,"Listen, next time you're in Minsk... .
"
19046,"Phoebe? Can I talk to you
"
19047,"for a second?
"
19048,"What are you doing?
"
19049,"I have plans with Joey.
"
19050,"So? He'll understand.
"
19051,"No, he won't.
"
19052,"And that's not even the point.
"
19053,"I made a whole speech about how
"
19054,"you do not cancel plans with friends.
"
19055,"And now just because, potentially,
"
19056,"the love of my life...
"
19057,"...returns from Russia
"
19058,"for one night...
"
19059,"...I should change my beliefs?
"
19060,"I should change my beliefs!
"
19061,"No. If I don't have my principles,
"
19062,"I don't have anything.
"
19063,"You're so strong.
"
19064,"Or I should rush through dinner
"
19065,"with Joey and meet David at 9.
"
19066,"Oh, my God, that is so good!
"
19067,"I'm full. And yet I know
"
19068,"if I stop eating this...
"
19069,"...I'll regret it.
"
19070,"Hey, what have you got there?
"
19071,"Oh, it's... .
"
19072,"It's tofu cake. Want some?
"
19073,"What are you doing tonight?
"
19074,"Dude. Dude.
"
19075,"Sorry.
"
19076,"I got plans with Phoebe.
"
19077,"Really? Monica said
"
19078,"she had a date at 9.
"
19079,"- What? Tonight?
"
19080,"- That's what Monica said.
"
19081,"After that speech, she makes a date on
"
19082,"the same night she has plans with me?
"
19083,"She's trying to pull a fast one
"
19084,"on Big Daddy.
"
19085,"Here, I think this is us.
"
19086,"Limited seating, my ass.
"
19087,"Let's see who made the cut.
"
19088,"Hi. I'm Monica Geller.
"
19089,"- How do you know the bride and groom?
"
19090,"- I worked with Frannie.
"
19091,"Used to work with her. Used to.
"
19092,"I'm a relative
"
19093,"and I didn't get invited.
"
19094,"A blood relative. Blood.
"
19095,"Stop saying ""blood"" to strangers.
"
19096,"And you? How do you know the couple?
"
19097,"We went to college with both of them.
"
19098,"Now we live next door.
"
19099,"Okay, you're fine.
"
19100,"- Are you guys ready?
"
19101,"- Yes.
"
19102,"I'll have a green salad,
"
19103,"house dressing and water's fine.
"
19104,"And for you, sir?
"
19105,"Yeah. This slow-roasted salmon...
"
19106,"...how slow are we talking?
"
19107,"It's already been roasted.
"
19108,"Oh, then no. Maybe I should hear
"
19109,"the specials again.
"
19110,"We've heard the specials three times.
"
19111,"There's prime rib, mahi-mahi
"
19112,"and a very special lobster ravioli.
"
19113,"- Actually, we're out of the ravioli.
"
19114,"- Well, that changes everything!
"
19115,"You know what, Pheebs?
"
19116,"You were right before.
"
19117,"Friends are so important.
"
19118,"Yeah, I'm very wise. I know.
"
19119,"Know what I really want?
"
19120,"- What?
"
19121,"- Is to have a long, long talk.
"
19122,"You know? Get Joey out on the
"
19123,"open road and really open him up.
"
19124,"- Any progress?
"
19125,"- Yes.
"
19126,"I will have the lobster ravioli.
"
19127,"God, Joey, this is taking forever.
"
19128,"- What's the rush?
"
19129,"- Well...
"
19130,"...I have an appointment.
"
19131,"And it's very important.
"
19132,"What is it?
"
19133,"Well...
"
19134,"...it's a date.
"
19135,"A date? No, you must be mistaken,
"
19136,"because you wouldn't have a date...
"
19137,"...on the same night
"
19138,"you have plans with a friend.
"
19139,"Don't make me feel badly.
"
19140,"No, I'm gonna!
"
19141,"You made me feel really guilty
"
19142,"about going out with that girl.
"
19143,"Like I did something terrible.
"
19144,"Now you're doing the same thing.
"
19145,"It's not! It's totally different!
"
19146,"This is with David.
"
19147,"Remember David, the scientist guy?
"
19148,"He's very special to me.
"
19149,"My girl the other night was special.
"
19150,"She was a scientist too.
"
19151,"- She was?
"
19152,"- Well, she graduated high school.
"
19153,"Whatever. Know what?
"
19154,"He's only here for four
"
19155,"hours and I'm gonna go see him.
"
19156,"- Fine!
"
19157,"- Yeah.
"
19158,"What are you still doing here?
"
19159,"I told you, lobster ravioli!
"
19160,"I was about to leave.
"
19161,"I didn't think you were coming.
"
19162,"I wouldn't have missed this.
"
19163,"Well, I'm very glad you're here.
"
19164,"Oh, you're such a gentleman.
"
19165,"Come on, we're going to my place.
"
19166,"Are you eating the cheesecake
"
19167,"without me?
"
19168,"I will give you $ 100
"
19169,"to whistle right now.
"
19170,"- How can you eat it without me?
"
19171,"- What'll you do?
"
19172,"Tell Monica or Joey?
"
19173,"No, you'd have to tell them everything.
"
19174,"We're dessert stealers.
"
19175,"We're living outside the law.
"
19176,"I don't trust you with this cake.
"
19177,"I got it first,
"
19178,"and I'm taking it back!
"
19179,"- What? Oh, no.
"
19180,"- Oh, yes.
"
19181,"You think I trust you with it?
"
19182,"No, we'll split it.
"
19183,"That's not fair. You had some.
"
19184,"I think Monica would be
"
19185,"very interested to know...
"
19186,"...that you called her cheesecake
"
19187,"""dry and mealy. ""
"
19188,"What do we use to split it?
"
19189,"All right, pick a half.
"
19190,"Well, this side looks bigger.
"
19191,"But there's more crust on this side.
"
19192,"Maybe if I measure it...
"
19193,"Pick a piece!
"
19194,"- All right, I pick that one.
"
19195,"- It's the smaller piece.
"
19196,"Okay. There you go.
"
19197,"Enjoy your half, my friend.
"
19198,"But that is it.
"
19199,"No sharing, no switching,
"
19200,"and don't come crying to me...
"
19201,"...if you eat your piece too fast.
"
19202,"- You gonna give me some of yours?
"
19203,"- Oh, no.
"
19204,"No switching, no sharing.
"
19205,"And don't come crying to me.
"
19206,"I may just sit here
"
19207,"and have my cake all day.
"
19208,"Just sit here in the hallway
"
19209,"and eat my...
"
19210,"Ross, sweetheart!
"
19211,"Oh, hey, Aunt Millie.
"
19212,"- Isn't it a beautiful wedding?
"
19213,"- Yes, it is.
"
19214,"Every time, on the lips!
"
19215,"Why? Why on the lips?
"
19216,"There's Frannie.
"
19217,"Won't she be happy to see me?
"
19218,"You be nice, all right?
"
19219,"I didn't bring you to ambush her.
"
19220,"Frannie was the one
"
19221,"who showed your Playboys to Mom.
"
19222,"That bitch.
"
19223,"Monica!
"
19224,"What...?
"
19225,"Am I doing here?
"
19226,"Surprised to see me?
"
19227,"Ross brought me.
"
19228,"How do you like that?
"
19229,"Hi, Frannie. Congratulations.
"
19230,"You invite my whole family,
"
19231,"and not me? Why?
"
19232,"Why wouldn't you want me here?
"
19233,"What could I have done?
"
19234,"Stuart!
"
19235,"I believe you know my husband.
"
19236,"So it's really a question
"
19237,"of ""who"" could you have done.
"
19238,"I hate this, but I have to go.
"
19239,"I can't miss my flight.
"
19240,"I bet there's
"
19241,"another flight to Minsk in...
"
19242,"July.
"
19243,"That's really beautiful.
"
19244,"What does it mean?
"
19245,"""Please clean my beakers. ""
"
19246,"I don't get out of the lab much.
"
19247,"I thought it meant something else.
"
19248,"Yeah, well, I really actually
"
19249,"wanted to say...
"
19250,"...that.
"
19251,"But I figured I probably shouldn't
"
19252,"because...
"
19253,"...I have to leave.
"
19254,"No, you're right. Don't say it.
"
19255,"I do, though.
"
19256,"I do too.
"
19257,"Well, bye, Phoebe.
"
19258,"Now's not the time, Joey.
"
19259,"You can yell at me tomorrow.
"
19260,"Wait, no, Pheebs.
"
19261,"I'm not gonna yell at you.
"
19262,"I just started thinking
"
19263,"about you and David...
"
19264,"...and I remember how bummed you were
"
19265,"the first time he left.
"
19266,"Oh, Pheebs, come here.
"
19267,"- Are you okay?
"
19268,"- No, I'm not okay.
"
19269,"The only guy I've ever been
"
19270,"crazy about is going to Minsk...
"
19271,"...and I may never see him again.
"
19272,"You could always visit him.
"
19273,"Right. Like they'll let me
"
19274,"have a passport.
"
19275,"Anything I can do? Whatever you need.
"
19276,"Well, now...
"
19277,"...if you achieve distillation of
"
19278,"subatomic particles before he does...
"
19279,"...then he could come back.
"
19280,"I could give it a shot.
"
19281,"Oh, look! There's a piece
"
19282,"that doesn't have floor on it.
"
19283,"- Stick to your side!
"
19284,"- Come on, now!
"
19285,"All right, what are we having?
"
19286,"Oh, wait, I forgot my wrap.
"
19287,"Okay, wait here.
"
19288,"Hi, sweetie! Are you leaving?
"
19289,"- Well...
"
19290,"- Give us a kiss. Come on.
"
19291,"Why? Why on the lips?
"
19292,"<font color=""#ffff00"" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net
"
19293,"Ross, when's this comet thing start?
"
19294,"Well, technically, it started
"
19295,"7 billion years ago.
"
19296,"Okay. Fine, I'll stop.
"
19297,"No teaching, okay?
"
19298,"We'll just watch the pretty light
"
19299,"streaking across the sky.
"
19300,"Okay?
"
19301,"Whose official name is Bapstein-King.
"
19302,"Okay! Okay!
"
19303,"There it is. Oh, look at that!
"
19304,"Isn't Mother Nature amazing?
"
19305,"That's a plane.
"
19306,"Well, all right, 1 700 bags
"
19307,"of peanuts flying that high...
"
19308,"...that's pretty amazing too.
"
19309,"- I wonder if you can see my apartment.
"
19310,"- No, you can't.
"
19311,"- What?
"
19312,"- I don't know.
"
19313,"Man, look at all those stars.
"
19314,"Infinite space. It really makes you
"
19315,"wonder, doesn't it?
"
19316,"- Know what else makes you wonder?
"
19317,"- What?
"
19318,"Check out the rack on that chick.

"
19322,"We've been out here for two hours...
"
19323,"...and we haven't seen any
"
19324,"stupid comets. Can we go now?
"
19325,"I mean, Chandler's getting chilly.
"
19326,"No, I'm not.
"
19327,"Then why are you wearing
"
19328,"Monica's jacket?
"
19329,"Because it's flattering!
"
19330,"Come on, Monica. Come on, Monica.
"
19331,"- We're going too. We got a movie.
"
19332,"- I won't say no to a movie.
"
19333,"Oh, Pheebs, we just actually
"
19334,"wanted to be alone.
"
19335,"- Sh. Get me out of here.
"
19336,"- Oh, okay.
"
19337,"- Hey, Ross.
"
19338,"- What?
"
19339,"- Check it out.
"
19340,"- Is it the comet?
"
19341,"No. Look, there's a bug
"
19342,"stuck in tar right here.
"
19343,"I can't believe...
"
19344,"I bring you to see
"
19345,"the Bapstein-King comet...
"
19346,"...one of nature's
"
19347,"most spectacular phenomena...
"
19348,"...and all you care about are bugs
"
19349,"stuck in tar and some woman.
"
19350,"You know, there's two women, dude.
"
19351,"Show me where.
"
19352,"Okay. Right up here.
"
19353,"Joey, where's the pipe
"
19354,"that was holding the door open?
"
19355,"I don't know.
"
19356,"Yeah, I do.
"
19357,"- Joey!
"
19358,"- What? Hey, don't look at me!
"
19359,"You wanted to come up here and look
"
19360,"for some stupid Burger King comet.
"
19361,"It's called the
"
19362,"Bapstein-King comet, okay?
"
19363,"Hey, Bapstein was a very
"
19364,"well-respected astronomer from...
"
19365,"No!
"
19366,"- Monica.
"
19367,"- She's sleeping.
"
19368,"I know. Just a quick question.
"
19369,"Which one was Deep Impact
"
19370,"and which one was Armageddon?
"
19371,"Deep Impact was the one
"
19372,"with Robert Duvall.
"
19373,"Armageddon is what's going
"
19374,"to happen to you if you wake me up.
"
19375,"Sorry, I just can't sleep.
"
19376,"Where's that book you're reading
"
19377,"with two women who are ice-skating...
"
19378,"...and wearing those hats
"
19379,"with the flowers on it.
"
19380,"Because every time I look
"
19381,"at that cover, I'm like...
"
19382,"It's in the living room,
"
19383,"where there's also a light...
"
19384,"...and no one will
"
19385,"kick you in the shin.
"
19386,"What?
"
19387,"Please don't be a spaceship.
"
19388,"Please don't be a spaceship.
"
19389,"Oh, thank God.
"
19390,"How could you be beeping?
"
19391,"I just disconnected you!
"
19392,"I took out your battery! How can...?
"
19393,"Don't interrupt me!
"
19394,"Monica! Monica!
"
19395,"Come on!
"
19396,"I can't believe this!
"
19397,"All right, well, I guess we know
"
19398,"what we have to do to get down.
"
19399,"Yeah, I guess we don't have a choice.
"
19400,"Help us! Please, help us!
"
19401,"We're stuck up on the roof,
"
19402,"and we can't get down!
"
19403,"Ross.
"
19404,"I was thinking we'd just
"
19405,"go down the fire escape.
"
19406,"I know. I wasn't finished.
"
19407,"But don't worry!
"
19408,"We're gonna go down the fire escape!
"
19409,"Sh!
"
19410,"I'm sorry, I thought I'd make some
"
19411,"warm milk and it would help me sleep.
"
19412,"With a wok?
"
19413,"My boring book didn't
"
19414,"put you to sleep?
"
19415,"It got interesting.
"
19416,"Damn you, Oprah!
"
19417,"Here, let me make the milk.
"
19418,"I'm up anyway.
"
19419,"You know what we could do
"
19420,"now that we're up?
"
19421,"We could just talk
"
19422,"to each other all night long.
"
19423,"Like when we were first dating.
"
19424,"It'd be fun.
"
19425,"- Okay, that does sound fun.
"
19426,"- Yeah.
"
19427,"So how bummed were you
"
19428,"when the second sister died, huh?
"
19429,"The second sister dies?!
"
19430,"No.
"
19431,"No, I was talking
"
19432,"about the book I was reading.
"
19433,"The second sister dies in
"
19434,"Archie and Jughead Double Digest?
"
19435,"That's correct.
"
19436,"Want to go in the bedroom?
"
19437,"It's more comfortable.
"
19438,"- Sure.
"
19439,"- Okay.
"
19440,"Oh, wait, did you send
"
19441,"those contracts to Milan?
"
19442,"If this is your idea of sexy talk... .
"
19443,"Did you overnight
"
19444,"the contracts I gave you?
"
19445,"What contracts?
"
19446,"Please tell me this is just one
"
19447,"of your jokes that I don't get.
"
19448,"Like what?
"
19449,"Like the thing when you
"
19450,"put the phone in your pants?
"
19451,"Tag, I'm serious.
"
19452,"This isn't funny.
"
19453,"Those contracts had to go out today.
"
19454,"You didn't give me any contracts.
"
19455,"Yes, I did. I put a little
"
19456,"Post-it on it that said:
"
19457,"""Must go out today,"" and I
"
19458,"underlined ""today"" three times.
"
19459,"Then I put a little heart in the
"
19460,"corner so I wouldn't seem too bossy.
"
19461,"You never gave them to me.
"
19462,"If we went to the office, you would see
"
19463,"those contracts sitting on your desk.
"
19464,"No, I'd see you looking embarrassed
"
19465,"because they are not on my desk.
"
19466,"Maybe I'm embarrassed because you
"
19467,"talk on the phone with your crotch.
"
19468,"You want to go to the office now?
"
19469,"Come on, it's late.
"
19470,"We're not going down to the office.
"
19471,"Yeah, I understand. I wouldn't
"
19472,"want to be proved wrong either.
"
19473,"All right, get your coat!
"
19474,"Oh! When did you unhook this?
"
19475,"Nice work!
"
19476,"It won't go down any further.
"
19477,"It's stuck.
"
19478,"We'll just have to jump.
"
19479,"Now, we're gonna have
"
19480,"to make sure to land...
"
19481,"...to the right of that
"
19482,"patch of ice, okay?
"
19483,"Not hit the dumpster
"
19484,"on the other side.
"
19485,"And try to avoid that weird
"
19486,"brownish-red stuff in the middle.
"
19487,"So when you get down there...
"
19488,"...you go up to the roof
"
19489,"and you let me in.
"
19490,"- Wait a minute. I have to do it?
"
19491,"- You'll be fine.
"
19492,"It'll be just like
"
19493,"bungee jumping, you know?
"
19494,"But instead of bouncing back up,
"
19495,"you won't.
"
19496,"Well, what if I smack
"
19497,"my head on the concrete?
"
19498,"Well, I'm not gonna lie to you, Joey.
"
19499,"It's a possibility.
"
19500,"I don't know. Tell you what,
"
19501,"let's flip to see who does it.
"
19502,"- You call it in the air, all right?
"
19503,"- Oh, all right.
"
19504,"- Can you see what it is?
"
19505,"- No.
"
19506,"- Okay. Well, you be careful.
"
19507,"- No, Ross, stop it.
"
19508,"I'm not jumping.
"
19509,"Look, I have an audition tomorrow,
"
19510,"and I can't go if I break my leg.
"
19511,"Well, I'm not jumping. I have a son.
"
19512,"He won't have a father if I die.
"
19513,"So it looks like we're even.
"
19514,"Okay, so this wire...
"
19515,"...is connected to this wire,
"
19516,"which plugs into here.
"
19517,"Okay, so to get the beeping to stop,
"
19518,"all I have to do... .
"
19519,"Okay.
"
19520,"Well done, Pheebs.
"
19521,"What do you want from me?!
"
19522,"Here's your milk.
"
19523,"What should we talk about?
"
19524,"What? What? What?
"
19525,"Oh, were you sleeping, sweetie?
"
19526,"I'm sorry. Here.
"
19527,"Okay. Feel free to look...
"
19528,"...but I'm telling you
"
19529,"those contracts are not here.
"
19530,"How could you know?
"
19531,"Look at this mess, Tag.
"
19532,"This is what I'm saying.
"
19533,"You have to be more organized.
"
19534,"You've got newspapers,
"
19535,"you've got magazines, you... Oh!
"
19536,"And who's this chippy?
"
19537,"A little young for you, but whatever.
"
19538,"That's my sister.
"
19539,"Really? Very cute braces.
"
19540,"Anyway, you know what?
"
19541,"The point is, Tag, start looking...
"
19542,"...because you're gonna find
"
19543,"those contracts on your desk.
"
19544,"So when do you imagine you gave
"
19545,"them to me? Morning or afternoon?
"
19546,"In the afternoon. Mr. Zelner
"
19547,"came into my office after lunch...
"
19548,"...he put them on my desk,
"
19549,"and then I put a Post-it on it...
"
19550,"...that said:
"
19551,"""Must go out today. ""
"
19552,"So you just keep looking
"
19553,"in there, all right?
"
19554,"They're not here.
"
19555,"Puzzler.
"
19556,"Bit of a puzzle.
"
19557,"Why don't you check the copy room?
"
19558,"Maybe the contracts are in there.
"
19559,"- How could I have left them there?
"
19560,"- I don't know.
"
19561,"How can your genitals
"
19562,"make phone calls?
"
19563,"Okay? It's not a perfect world.
"
19564,"Just go, please?
"
19565,"- Fine.
"
19566,"- Thank you.
"
19567,"Hello?
"
19568,"I still don't get it.
"
19569,"You still awake?
"
19570,"Yeah. You?
"
19571,"You do know that was me
"
19572,"that just said that, right?
"
19573,"Hey.
"
19574,"As long as we're both up... .
"
19575,"Yeah?
"
19576,"I hope you're not thinking
"
19577,"about cleaning the living room.
"
19578,"Man, I'm starving. What the hell
"
19579,"was I thinking at dinner?
"
19580,"""Do you want soup or salad?""
"
19581,"Both, always order both.
"
19582,"You know, I'm looking,
"
19583,"and I don't think anyone's home here.
"
19584,"I say we just break the window...
"
19585,"...crawl through...
"
19586,"...and you know, explain later.
"
19587,"- No one's home?
"
19588,"- I don't think so.
"
19589,"Hello?
"
19590,"So when you get in there... .
"
19591,"Okay. This is where
"
19592,"you and I part ways.
"
19593,"Noisy bitch!
"
19594,"Oh, what? What are you doing?
"
19595,"Do you know what just happened?
"
19596,"Yeah. We had sex
"
19597,"and then we fell asleep.
"
19598,"No. We were in the middle of sex...
"
19599,"...and you fell asleep.
"
19600,"No. No, that's not true.
"
19601,"No, best time ever.
"
19602,"Yeah. You rock my world.
"
19603,"- Monica?
"
19604,"- What?
"
19605,"I was giving you some of
"
19606,"my best moves, and you missed it.
"
19607,"So please wake up
"
19608,"so we can do it right.
"
19609,"Okay. Okay. I'm ready.
"
19610,"- Come on, big fella.
"
19611,"- Okay.
"
19612,"- Give me the good stuff.
"
19613,"- Yeah.
"
19614,"No, no, no. Don't fall asleep.
"
19615,"Okay, I'm going
"
19616,"to make you some coffee.
"
19617,"Well, I probably won't spill coffee
"
19618,"grounds all over the kitchen floor.
"
19619,"Okay, I'm up. I'm up.
"
19620,"Hi. I got you some coffee to...
"
19621,"So you got anything for me?
"
19622,"- Still no luck.
"
19623,"- Oh, my God.
"
19624,"You checked your entire desk
"
19625,"and all the drawers?
"
19626,"- Want me to check again?
"
19627,"- I wish you would.
"
19628,"Well, no, it's not in there.
"
19629,"How about that drawer?
"
19630,"Well, it's not out here.
"
19631,"Any chance it could be in your office?
"
19632,"I don't know.
"
19633,"I mean, let me check.
"
19634,"Any luck?
"
19635,"See you in my office for a minute?
"
19636,"You found them!
"
19637,"I'm not even gonna gloat.
"
19638,"- I'm just really relieved it's...
"
19639,"- You put these on my desk.
"
19640,"- I did not.
"
19641,"- Oh, really?
"
19642,"So they left your bottom drawer...
"
19643,"...crawled across the floor,
"
19644,"then jumped onto my desk?
"
19645,"How did you know
"
19646,"they were in my bottom drawer?
"
19647,"I am so hot for you right now.
"
19648,"Oh, my God!

"
19653,"Can I help you?
"
19654,"Your fire alarm was in the trash.
"
19655,"- That's not mine.
"
19656,"- Yes, it is.
"
19657,"How do you know?
"
19658,"If you dump a fire alarm,
"
19659,"don't use a blanket that says:
"
19660,"""Property of Phoebe Buffay,
"
19661,"not Monica. ""
"
19662,"Do you have a search warrant?
"
19663,"Because the last time I checked,
"
19664,"this was still America.
"
19665,"Please reattach it.
"
19666,"It's illegal to disconnect them.
"
19667,"Fine. But please, God, tell me
"
19668,"how to stop it from going off?
"
19669,"Press the reset button.
"
19670,"There's a reset button?
"
19671,"Oh, thank you. Thank you.
"
19672,"Oh. There's a reset button?
"
19673,"My God!
"
19674,"Why didn't I see that?
"
19675,"Reset button. Reset button.
"
19676,"Where is there a reset button?
"
19677,"Oh, here it is! Oh!
"
19678,"- Okay, you have a good grip?
"
19679,"- Yeah.
"
19680,"I'm gonna start to climb down you now.
"
19681,"- All right, just hurry up.
"
19682,"- Okay.
"
19683,"Now, should I climb down your front
"
19684,"so we're face to face...
"
19685,"...or should I climb down
"
19686,"your back so we're...
"
19687,"...butt to face?
"
19688,"- Face to face.
"
19689,"- I like face to face.
"
19690,"- Okay, here I come.
"
19691,"- All right.
"
19692,"Oh, my... How much do you weigh, Ross?
"
19693,"I prefer not to answer. I'm still
"
19694,"carrying a little holiday weight.
"
19695,"When we talked about face to face...
"
19696,"...I don't think we thought it
"
19697,"all the way through.
"
19698,"- What do you want me to do?
"
19699,"- Just shimmy down me and drop.
"
19700,"- Hi.
"
19701,"- Hi.
"
19702,"You know, maybe I should hang,
"
19703,"and you should climb down me.
"
19704,"Yeah? Maybe we should talk
"
19705,"about that for a little while!
"
19706,"- It still looks pretty far.
"
19707,"- It's not that far. Just drop.
"
19708,"Do not rush me!
"
19709,"My pants are starting to come down,

"
19711,"My ankle! I really hurt my ankle!
"
19712,"I think I twisted it when...
"
19713,"A quarter!
"
19714,"That really was
"
19715,"some of your best work.
"
19716,"I told you.
"
19717,"I can't believe it.
"
19718,"I've only got two hours

"

19730,"- What are you doing?
"
19731,"- I was thinking of moving the couch.
"
19732,"Why would you want to do that?
"
19733,"So there'd be a decent place

"
19761,"I checked the real estate section.
"
19762,"Look at this.
"
19763,"Looks like Mom and Dad's house.
"
19764,"Even has a tree
"
19765,"with a broken limb out front.

19766,"And the window in the attic... .
"
19767,"Oh, my God!
"
19768,"What happened
"
19769,"to the window in the attic?
"
19770,"- I can't believe they're selling it.
"
19771,"- And they didn't tell us.

"
19774,"I'll buy you a new one, okay?
"
19775,"We'll go to the store and get you

"
19793,"I gotta say, a tanning bed and a stack

"

"
19797,"- As much as they love you?

"
19814,"What?
"
19815,"Oh, yeah, like you never called.
"
19816,"This is very easy.
"
19817,"You read from the script...
"
19818,"...and try to sell as much
"
19819,"toner as you can.
"
19820,"Okay, I can do that.
"
19821,"By the way, I love my office.
"
19822,"- Why don't we do a trial run?
"

"
19832,"Okay, sorry to bother you. Bye-bye.
"
19833,"Yeah, you're right. This is easy.
"
19834,"Okay. What was wrong with that call?
"
19835,"Oh, well, all right.
"
19836,"No offense,
"
19837,"but you were kind of rude.
"
19838,"They always say they
"
19839,"don't need toner. That's okay.
"
19840,"Whatever they say, you can find the
"
19841,"answer to it, here in the script.
"
19842,"So I think you're ready to sell toner.
"
19843,"- Do you have any last questions?
"
19844,"- No.
"
19845,"Wait, yes, I do have one question:
"
19846,"What is toner?
"
19847,"Joey?
"
19848,"Joe?
"
19849,"Full bag?
"
19850,"Beer's still cold.
"
19851,"Something terrible
"
19852,"must have happened here.
"
19853,"Oh, no, no, no!
"
19854,"Stevie, I was never here.
"

"
19856,"- I'm here!

"
19899,"How are you ever gonna sell
"
19900,"this place?
"
19901,"I think I accidentally
"
19902,"used Monica's boxes...
"
19903,"...to keep the water away
"
19904,"from the Porsche.
"
19905,"Oh, no, Dad. Dad?
"
19906,"What the...

"

"
19921,"about your toner needs.
"
19922,"I don't need any toner.
"
19923,"I hear what you're saying, but at
"
19924,"our prices, everyone needs toner.
"
19925,"Not me.
"
19926,"May I ask why?
"
19927,"You want to know why?
"
19928,"You want to know why?
"
19929,"I surely do.
"
19930,"Okay. 
"
19931,"I don't need any toner...
"
19932,"...because I'm gonna kill myself.
"
19933,"Is that because you're out of toner?
"
19934,"Okay, so no toner today.
"
19935,"Thanks anyway. Bye-bye.
"
19936,"Wait, wait! I can't let you hang up.
"
19937,"Just please talk to me.
"
19938,"Well... .
"
19939,"I only had one thing to do today.
"
19940,"I guess I could push it back.
"
19941,"Yeah. Now, why do you
"
19942,"want to kill yourself?
"
19943,"I've been working for 10 years
"
19944,"now at this...
"
19945,"...meaningless, dead-end job...
"
19946,"...and nobody here

"
19954,"...surrounded by people.
"
19955,"I've been talking to you for five
"
19956,"minutes now about killing myself...
"
19957,"...and no one's even looked up
"
19958,"from their desk. Hang on.
"
19959,"Hey, everybody...
"
19960,"...I'm gonna kill myself.
"
19961,"I got nothing.
"
19962,"Good chair.
"
19963,"Now, if anybody asks...
"
19964,"...your name is Rosita.
"
19965,"Poor thing. Cut down in her prime.
"
19966,"Joey, the new chair
"
19967,"will be here in an hour.
"
19968,"Maybe we should move

"
19970,"Start the healing process.
"
19971,"Yeah, I guess you're right.
"
19972,"She's healed!
"
19973,"That's weird.
"
19974,"No, it's not weird.
"
19975,"It's a miracle!
"
19976,"It's not a miracle. I'm sure
"
19977,"there's an explanation.
"
19978,"There is. If your heart is pure,
"
19979,"wondrous things can happen.
"
19980,"She'll understand.
"
19981,"I didn't do it on purpose.
"
19982,"Dad, that won't matter to her.
"
19983,"Look, all my stuff is safe and dry.
"
19984,"And all her stuff is...
"
19985,"...growing new stuff.
"
19986,"This is the kind of thing...
"
19987,"...that makes her think
"
19988,"you love me more than her.
"
19989,"My God. Does she think that?
"
19990,"Well, can you blame her?
"
19991,"We may have favored you unconsciously.
"
19992,"You were a marvel.
"
19993,"- The doctors said your mom couldn't...
"
19994,"- I don't want to hear it.
"
19995,"- Really?
"
19996,"- Well, not right now.
"
19997,"Monica came here for some memories.
"
19998,"Damn it, we'll give her some.
"
19999,"Okay, grab... .
"
20000,"Grab some boxes. We'll take stuff
"
20001,"from mine...
"
20002,"...and whatever we can pass off
"
20003,"as hers, we'll put in there.
"
20004,"Like, this. She could have made this.
"
20005,"- This could have been hers.
"
20006,"- Sure.
"
20007,"If you want to tell the medical marvel
"
20008,"story while we work, that'd be fine.
"
20009,"I am so psyched
"
20010,"I kept this chair for myself.
"
20011,"Yeah. Me too.
"
20012,"You know, this thing has
"
20013,"speakers in the headrest?
"
20014,"- No, really?
"
20015,"- Yeah.
"
20016,"You can hook it to the TV
"
20017,"and you get radio.
"
20018,"My chair heals itself.
"
20019,"All right. Let's just forget about
"
20020,"the people at the office, okay?
"
20021,"There's gotta be someone
"
20022,"worth sticking around for.
"
20023,"What about family or friends?
"
20024,"Maybe a girlfriend?
"
20025,"Yeah, right.
"
20026,"Oh, sorry. Boyfriend?
"
20027,"Okay, I should...
"
20028,"...be getting back to my thing now.
"
20029,"See you.
"
20030,"I'm not finished!
"
20031,"Don't you dare hang up on me!
"
20032,"The new girl's good.
"
20033,"Which boxes are mine?
"
20034,"- These are yours right here.
"
20035,"- Okay.
"
20036,"A coloring book.
"
20037,"You loved that thing.
"
20038,"You never went anywhere without...
"
20039,"...without that coloring book.
"
20040,"Really?
"
20041,"Looks like I had trouble
"
20042,"staying in the lines.
"
20043,"Nuh-uh!
"
20044,"Wow, look at this.
"
20045,"I can't believe I even
"
20046,"fit into this shirt.
"
20047,"Oh, this is yours.
"
20048,"I don't know how that got in there.
"
20049,"Hey, this isn't my stuff.
"
20050,"Ross, these are your boxes.
"
20051,"Where are my boxes?
"
20052,"The garage flooded, sweetie,
"
20053,"and ruined your boxes. I'm sorry.
"
20054,"Just mine?
"
20055,"I'm afraid so.
"
20056,"Why wasn't Ross' stuff ruined?
"
20057,"I used your boxes to divert
"
20058,"water away from the Porsche.
"
20059,"Ross' stuff is fine,
"
20060,"but I have no memories...
"
20061,"...so you could keep the bottom
"
20062,"of your car from water?
"
20063,"There was also
"
20064,"leaves and gook and stuff.
"
20065,"I can't believe this!
"
20066,"Screw it. I'm having one.
"
20067,"- Hey, Chandler.
"
20068,"- Hey.
"
20069,"How'd you like to sit
"
20070,"in a chair that reclines...
"
20071,"...has a rolling massage...
"
20072,"...and speakers in the headrest?
"
20073,"I've tried that so many times...
"
20074,"...they won't even let me
"
20075,"in the store anymore.
"
20076,"What if I said you could
"
20077,"do it in my apartment?
"
20078,"Are you telling me...
"
20079,"...you bought the chair
"
20080,"that makes all others obsolete?
"
20081,"The chair that Sit Magazine called
"
20082,"""Chair of the Year""?
"
20083,"I just purchased...
"
20084,"...the La-Z-Boy E-Cliner 3000.
"
20085,"Well, that's awesome! That's great!
"
20086,"What made you do it?
"
20087,"It's a long story, but,
"
20088,"I broke Joey's chair...
"
20089,"Whoa, whoa, whoa.
"
20090,"You broke Joey's chair?
"
20091,"I thought I did, that's why
"
20092,"I replaced it with mine.
"
20093,"That's how it got fixed!
"
20094,"You thought that elves
"
20095,"came in and fixed it?
"
20096,"No.
"
20097,"Angels.
"
20098,"I'm getting my chair back.
"
20099,"Well, looks like
"
20100,"it wasn't healed after all!
"
20101,"I guess this chair's mine now.
"
20102,"Joey, you broke my chair!
"
20103,"Your chair?
"
20104,"He thought he broke it,
"
20105,"so he switched chairs.
"
20106,"So there was no miracle?
"
20107,"No, Joe. No miracle.
"
20108,"Oh, no! This is devastating!
"
20109,"My faith is shaken. I'm glad I have
"
20110,"a new chair to get me through this.
"
20111,"Where can I find Earl?
"
20112,"He's the supply manager here.
"
20113,"I don't know any Earl.
"
20114,"I'm right here!
"
20115,"Earl?
"
20116,"I'm Phoebe.
"
20117,"Phoebe?
"
20118,"The lady who sells toner?
"
20119,"Look, you can't kill yourself.
"
20120,"Look, I really appreciate
"
20121,"you coming down...
"
20122,"No, I can't let you do it.
"
20123,"- Why?
"
20124,"- Because, fate made me call you today.
"
20125,"I thought it was toner.
"
20126,"Think about it, okay?
"
20127,"This isn't even my regular job.
"
20128,"My first day, you're my first call.
"
20129,"Somebody else may have hung up,
"
20130,"but I wouldn't do that...
"
20131,"...because I know about this stuff.
"
20132,"- My mom killed herself.
"
20133,"- Really?
"
20134,"How?
"
20135,"I'm not gonna give you tips.
"
20136,"Don't you see that this...
"
20137,"...all came together so I could
"
20138,"stop you from doing this?
"
20139,"- Couldn't it just be a coincidence?
"
20140,"- No, it's fate.
"
20141,"It doesn't really seem like
"
20142,"enough to be fate.
"
20143,"Oh, well.
"
20144,"Okay, here's a weird thing.
"
20145,"My mother was also a supply manager.
"
20146,"I'm actually the office manager.
"
20147,"Oh, my God! So was she!
"
20148,"And get this, okay.
"
20149,"Your name is Earl, right?
"
20150,"Her name was Pearl.
"
20151,"Puh-Earl.
"
20152,"Was there anything else?
"
20153,"Sure.
"
20154,"Where're you from?
"
20155,"- Philadelphia.
"
20156,"- Oh, my God, so was she!
"
20157,"I've got goose bumps.
"
20158,"Really?
"
20159,"I'm wearing layers, and it's warm.
"
20160,"These jerks might not care about you...
"
20161,"...but the universe does,
"
20162,"and that says a lot.
"
20163,"Did you hear that?
"
20164,"I don't need you guys
"
20165,"to care about me...
"
20166,"...because the universe cares!
"
20167,"The whole universe!
"
20168,"I really wish they'd care
"
20169,"a little bit.
"
20170,"Oh, this is terrible.
"
20171,"Everything is destroyed.
"
20172,"Look at this.
"
20173,"It meant enough for me to save,
"
20174,"and now I can't tell what it is.
"
20175,"It's still soft.
"
20176,"What do you think this is?
"
20177,"I think it was a mouse.
"
20178,"- How are you, honey?
"
20179,"- How do you think I am?
"
20180,"You've wrecked my childhood memories...
"
20181,"...you love Ross more than me.
"
20182,"And I just rubbed
"
20183,"a dead mouse on my face.
"
20184,"Sweetheart, we love you
"
20185,"just as much as Ross.
"
20186,"I'm sorry about what happened...
"
20187,"...and I probably can't
"
20188,"make it up to you...
"
20189,"...but here's a start.
"
20190,"- What's this?
"
20191,"- It's the key to my Porsche.
"
20192,"Well, the key to your Porsche.
"
20193,"What?
"
20194,"What?!
"
20195,"I've considered getting rid of it.
"
20196,"I saw my reflection the other day.
"
20197,"Your mother's right,
"
20198,"I do look like an ass.
"
20199,"You're giving it to me?
"
20200,"You're kidding.
"
20201,"Well, wait a minute.
"
20202,"A couple of stupid boxes get wet,
"
20203,"and she gets a Porsche?
"
20204,"- Let's take a drive?
"
20205,"- All right!
"
20206,"What about me? I'm a medical marvel!
"
20207,"Hey, guys.
"
20208,"Have you seen Chandler's chair?
"
20209,"Joey broke it. He got rid of it.
"
20210,"Are you kidding? I get a Porsche
"
20211,"and the Barcalounger's gone?
"
20212,"This is the best day ever!

"
20237,"Come on, Rach, turning 30
"
20238,"is not that big a deal.
"
20239,"Really? Is that how you felt

20240,"when you turned 30?
"
20241,"Why, God, why?
"
20242,"We had a deal.
"
20243,"Let the others grow old, not me!
"

"
20256,"Your roommate's a soap opera star.
"
20257,"Your character is in a coma.
"
20258,"I promised myself
"
20259,"I wouldn't cry at this one.
"
20260,"I know my life's going pretty well,
"
20261,"but I see so many people...

"
20263,"before they're 30.
"
20264,"Yeah, but you shouldn't compare

20267,"- You can do it!
"
20268,"- Come on.
"

"
20270,"I did it!

"
20276,"Oh, well. But, yeah!
"

"

"
20280,"What do you want to do?
"
20281,"I don't want to do anything.
"
20282,"Doing nothing on your 30th is better
"
20283,"than doing something stupid, like Ross.
"
20284,"That was a practical purchase.
"
20285,"I needed that car for transportation.
"
20286,"Okay? I have a child.
"
20287,"How hot do I look in this?
"
20288,"Ross, a sports car?
"
20289,"Wouldn't it be cheaper
"
20290,"to just stuff a sock down there?
"
20291,"That's not what this is about.
"
20292,"I am a sports car enthusiast.
"

"
20294,"- What's the horsepower?
"

20307,"Really? Because that hurts.
"
20308,"So what?
"
20309,"The way I see it...
"
20310,"Son of a bitch!
"
20311,"Look, I know what
"
20312,"you're going through.
"
20313,"I'm totally freaked out

"
20315,"Get out of my apartment.

"
20323,"For the last time, it's not named

"
20325,"You've done a wonderful job with

20326,"the party. Everything's so lovely.
"

"
20328,"I can't believe you have a

"
20330,"And I can't believe you have
"
20331,"a tux that's 30 years old.
"
20332,"It's older than that. Ross was
"
20333,"conceived right near this tuxedo.
"
20334,"Everybody hide!
"
20335,"She's coming.
"
20336,"Everybody down!
"
20337,"Everybody stay here.
"
20338,"I'll find out what's going on.
"
20339,"Hey, you got the door open!
"
20340,"Hey, are you drunk?
"
20341,"No.
"
20342,"Okay.
"
20343,"Okay.
"
20344,"See, I was a little nervous
"
20345,"about turning...
"
20346,"...30.
"
20347,"So the busboys took me out
"
20348,"for some drinks.
"
20349,"Might want to puke on you later.
"
20350,"Here's the thing. We've thrown
"
20351,"a very formal surprise party for you.
"
20352,"- Your parents and friends are in there.
"
20353,"- No!
"
20354,"- Yes! Yes!
"
20355,"- No.
"
20356,"Oh, no! My parents have never
"
20357,"seen me drunk.
"
20358,"That they know of.
"
20359,"We'll get you some coffee.
"
20360,"They'll never know that you're drunk.
"
20361,"- You promise?
"
20362,"- I'll take care of it.
"
20363,"I love you so much.
"
20364,"Okay, we have to do something
"
20365,"about your breath.
"
20366,"What about your breath?
"
20367,"That's still yours.
"
20368,"Now remember,
"
20369,"it's a surprise party.
"
20370,"So when you go in, act surprised.
"
20371,"Ready?
"
20372,"Surprise!
"
20373,"Okay, forward. Forward.
"
20374,"Stop!
"
20375,"Okay, back... Stop!
"
20376,"Okay, for... Stop!
"
20377,"Stop! Stop!
"
20378,"Okay, here's what we're gonna do.
"
20379,"I'll break into this minivan,
"
20380,"put it in neutral.
"
20381,"You push it forward
"
20382,"so Ross can get out of the spot.
"
20383,"All right. Here we go.
"
20384,"Haul ass!
"
20385,"Happy 30th birthday! Here.
"
20386,"It's for the child in you.
"
20387,"And the woman.
"
20388,"Happy 30th!
"
20389,"Why do you keep saying that?
"
20390,"Because it's our 30th birthday.
"
20391,"Yeah, no, we're not 30.
"
20392,"We're 31. Okay.
"
20393,"Wait.
"
20394,"Oh, it's you.
"
20395,"Yeah. What?
"
20396,"Yeah, we're not 30. We're 31.
"
20397,"That's what it says
"
20398,"on my birth certificate.
"
20399,"You have a birth certificate?
"
20400,"I got a big box of family stuff
"
20401,"when my mom died.
"
20402,"Our mom.
"
20403,"Right. Okay.
"
20404,"- Do you have mine?
"
20405,"- No, I sold it to a Swedish runaway.
"
20406,"Oh, my God.
"
20407,"Oh, my God, we are 31!
"
20408,"Yeah.
"
20409,"I just lost a whole year of my life.
"
20410,"Okay.
"
20411,"- Your middle name is Pamela?
"
20412,"- Yes.
"
20413,"I never knew mine.
"
20414,"Do you remember what it is?
"
20415,"Yes.
"
20416,"Phoebe.
"
20417,"- That's my first name.
"
20418,"- Right. Okay. Then, no.
"
20419,"We made it across the room.
"
20420,"You're doing great.
"
20421,"What's going on?
"
20422,"Monica's a little drunk.
"
20423,"Yeah! I love drunk Monica.
"
20424,"Oh, she's so much more fun
"
20425,"than regular Monica.
"
20426,"She doesn't want her parents to know.
"
20427,"All right, all right.
"
20428,"Here's what we'll do.
"
20429,"I'll get twice as drunk,
"
20430,"then no one will even notice her.
"
20431,"What's going on?
"
20432,"Monica's wasted.
"
20433,"Maybe that'll liven up this party.
"
20434,"Will you just help her get changed?
"
20435,"Taking care of a drunk, naked woman
"
20436,"seems like a job for Joey.
"
20437,"This one's from me.
"
20438,"It wasn't on your list,
"
20439,"but it's really fun.
"
20440,"A scooter.
"
20441,"Stick to the list.
"
20442,"Always stick to the list.
"
20443,"No, no, I love it. Thank you.
"
20444,"Open ours next! Open ours next!
"
20445,"Now that you're a couple,
"
20446,"we don't get two gifts?
"
20447,"For my last birthday,
"
20448,"you gave me a hug.
"
20449,"Read the card! Read the card!
"
20450,"""Happy birthday, Grandma.
"
20451,"It's better to be over the hill...
"
20452,"...than buried under it.
"
20453,"All our love, Monica and Chandler. ""
"
20454,"That's funny.
"
20455,"No, no. That was a joke.
"
20456,"I know, I get it. It's funny.
"
20457,"Because you're not a grandma.
"
20458,"To be a grandma, you have to
"
20459,"be married and have children.
"
20460,"I don't have any of those things.
"
20461,"That's why it's so funny.
"
20462,"I'm just gonna go... .
"
20463,"All you had to do was buy the card.
"
20464,"It was stupid to get upset about
"
20465,"not having a husband and kids.
"
20466,"All I really needed was a plan.
"
20467,"See, I want three kids.
"
20468,"And you want to have them all at the
"
20469,"same time and all for your brother.
"
20470,"As I was saying... .
"
20471,"I should have the first one
"
20472,"by the time I'm 35.
"
20473,"Which gives me five years.
"
20474,"If I want a kid when I'm 35, I don't
"
20475,"have to get pregnant until I'm 34.
"
20476,"Which gives Prada four years
"
20477,"to start making maternity clothes.
"
20478,"But I want to be married
"
20479,"for a year before I get pregnant.
"
20480,"Really? That long?
"
20481,"Look all you want, it's happening.
"
20482,"I don't have to get married until
"
20483,"I'm 33. That's three whole years.
"
20484,"Wait a minute, though.
"
20485,"I'll need a year and a half
"
20486,"to plan the wedding.
"
20487,"And I'd like to know the guy
"
20488,"for a year, year and a half...
"
20489,"...before we get engaged.
"
20490,"Which means I need to meet the guy
"
20491,"by the time I'm 30.
"
20492,"Which is fine
"
20493,"because you just turned...
"
20494,"...28!
"
20495,"No, Ross. No, it is not fine.
"
20496,"I should already be with
"
20497,"the guy I'm gonna marry.
"
20498,"Will you quit hogging it?
"
20499,"I'm telling you, it's like
"
20500,"watching Bambi learn how to walk.
"
20501,"You're drunk.
"
20502,"Mom and Dad are gonna be mad.
"
20503,"Maybe I'm a little drunk.
"
20504,"Are those crab cakes?
"
20505,"I told you to come straight to me
"
20506,"when they were ready.
"
20507,"How you feeling?
"
20508,"You are so handsome.
"
20509,"I want to make love to you
"
20510,"right here, right now.
"
20511,"I really wish that you wouldn't.
"
20512,"Just get through a little bit more,
"
20513,"then we can put you in bed.
"
20514,"Just smile, and don't talk to anyone.
"
20515,"Speech, speech!
"
20516,"Let's hear from the birthday girl.
"
20517,"Pheebs!
"
20518,"See, everybody's looking at me.
"
20519,"The plan's working.
"
20520,"I didn't even have to
"
20521,"take off my top yet.
"
20522,"Speech. Come on, speech!
"
20523,"You can't keep your hands off her
"
20524,"for one second.
"
20525,"I think it's nice.
"
20526,"I think it's necessary.
"
20527,"I want to thank you all for coming.
"
20528,"My family and...
"
20529,"...my friends.
"
20530,"I'd really like to say that I'm... .
"
20531,"You know what I'd really like to say?
"
20532,"I'm drunk!
"
20533,"That's right, Mom and Dad.
"
20534,"Your little old ""Harmomica"" is hammered.
"
20535,"And guess what?
"
20536,"I've been drunk before.
"
20537,"And I've smoked a cigarette.
"
20538,"It's all okay.
"
20539,"It's okay because...
"
20540,"...I turned 30 today.
"
20541,"And I can do anything I want.
"
20542,"Because I am a grownup.
"
20543,"Okay, quick. Help me get this off.
"
20544,"I lost a whole year.
"
20545,"I can't believe it.
"
20546,"This is so unfair!
"
20547,"Come on, Pheebs, it'll be okay.
"
20548,"Will it? Will it?
"
20549,"How would you feel if
"
20550,"you found out you were 31?
"
20551,"That's not gonna happen.
"
20552,"Because we have a new deal.
"
20553,"Plus, it ruined my schedule.
"
20554,"I haven't done the things
"
20555,"I wanted to do before I was 31.
"
20556,"Like what?
"
20557,"Like I haven't met
"
20558,"any Portuguese people.
"
20559,"I haven't had the perfect kiss.
"
20560,"And I haven't been to sniper school.
"
20561,"Why don't we go and
"
20562,"have some birthday cake?
"
20563,"I just feel like being by myself.
"
20564,"See you guys later. Thanks.
"
20565,"Poor Pheebs.
"
20566,"Hey, you guys, I think
"
20567,"I'm gonna walk her home.
"
20568,"- Oh, man.
"
20569,"- What?
"
20570,"He's gonna eat the cake.
"
20571,"Pheebs!
"
20572,"Listen, I... .
"
20573,"Close your eyes.
"
20574,"That's one thing to
"
20575,"cross off your list.
"
20576,"Oh, yeah.
"
20577,"Plus, I'm one-sixteenth Portuguese.
"
20578,"Okay, is everybody clear?
"
20579,"We're gonna pick it up...
"
20580,"...and move it.
"
20581,"All we need is teamwork.
"
20582,"We're gonna lift the car...
"
20583,"...and slide it out.
"
20584,"Lift...
"
20585,"...and slide.
"
20586,"- Ross, I really don't think this...
"
20587,"- Lift...
"
20588,"...and slide.
"
20589,"- Okay, here we go.
"
20590,"- All right, everyone.
"
20591,"Lift...
"
20592,"...and slide.
"
20593,"- Hey, Joey...
"
20594,"- Come on, Rach, my turn just started.
"
20595,"Actually, I just want to talk to Tag.
"
20596,"Oh, okay.
"
20597,"Hey, can I ride this outside?
"
20598,"Whatever. I'm not your mother.
"
20599,"Not in the street!
"
20600,"- Are you feeling any better?
"
20601,"- Yeah, I'm doing okay. I'm... .
"
20602,"Let's talk.
"
20603,"What's up?
"
20604,"Oh, Tag... .
"
20605,"You're such a great guy.
"
20606,"And we have so much fun together.
"
20607,"- But l...
"
20608,"- Wait.
"
20609,"I think I see where you're going.
"
20610,"Before you say anything else,
"
20611,"can I say one more thing?
"
20612,"Well said.
"
20613,"And a good example of the fun
"
20614,"I was referring to.
"
20615,"But I think I'm past the point
"
20616,"where I can just have fun.
"
20617,"Don't do this. This is just
"
20618,"because you're turning 30.
"
20619,"Yeah, it is.
"
20620,"But you're just a kid.
"
20621,"I mean, you're 25.
"
20622,"- Twenty-four, actually.
"
20623,"- Oh, God.
"
20624,"You know what I wish?
"
20625,"I wish you were six years older.
"
20626,"Well, if I'm wishing for stuff,
"
20627,"I wish I was six years younger.
"
20628,"- Me too.
"
20629,"- Yeah. Sorry.
"
20630,"Hey, how'd it go?
"
20631,"If I only want two kids,
"
20632,"can I keep him for another year?
"
20633,"You did the right thing.
"
20634,"I don't like this anymore.
"
20635,"Well, here we are.
"
20636,"Just a bunch of 30-year-olds.
"
20637,"Do you realize in 10 years
"
20638,"we're gonna be 40?
"
20639,"Why, God?
"
20640,"Why are you doing this to us?
"
20641,"Yes! My baby's finally free.
"
20642,"All right!
"
20643,"Start it up. Let's go!
"
20644,"How hot are we?
"

"
20647,"Thanks for coming by.
"
20648,"We wanted to bounce some ideas off
"
20649,"of you about the wedding ceremony.
"
20650,"- What's the matter? Are you okay?
"
20651,"- It's just... .
"
20652,"Monica said ""wedding. ""
"
20653,"We thought one of you
"
20654,"could read something.
"
20655,"Okay, yeah, I guess I can do that too.
"
20656,"Too?
"
20657,"I kind of have something else
"
20658,"planned for you guys.
"
20659,"- Do you mind telling us what it is?
"
20660,"- Sorry.
"
20661,"I'm kind of keeping this one
"
20662,"on the QT.
"
20663,"Whatever it is,
"
20664,"I hope it involves winking.
"
20665,"- Hey.
"
20666,"- Hey.
"
20667,"I talked to one of the DOOL writers...
"
20668,"- What is DOOL?
"
20669,"-Days Of Our Lives. 
"
20670,"You won't believe it. My character
"
20671,"is coming out of his coma!
"
20672,"- That's wonderful.
"
20673,"- Wow, Joey.
"
20674,"And not only that.
"
20675,"I'm getting a new brain!
"
20676,"So great things are happening at work
"
20677,"and in your personal life.
"
20678,"You're getting a new brain?
"
20679,"They're killing off
"
20680,"one of the characters...
"
20681,"...and her brain is being transplanted
"
20682,"into my body.
"
20683,"What? A brain transplant?
"
20684,"It's ridiculous.
"
20685,"It's ridiculous that you
"
20686,"haven't had sex in three months.
"
20687,"It's winter.
"
20688,"There are fewer people on the street.
"
20689,"Who are they killing off?
"
20690,"Cecilia Monroe.
"
20691,"She plays Jessica Lockhart.
"
20692,"No!
"
20693,"She is so good at throwing drinks
"
20694,"in people's faces.
"
20695,"I don't think I've ever seen
"
20696,"her finish a drink.
"
20697,"The way she slaps people.
"
20698,"Wouldn't you love to?
"
20699,"Don't do it.
"
20700,"And she's been on the show forever.
"
20701,"It's gonna be really hard
"
20702,"to fill her shoes.
"
20703,"Help me out here.
"
20704,"When you come out
"
20705,"of the brain transplant...
"
20706,"...you are going to be her?
"
20707,"Yes, but in Drake Ramoray's body.
"
20708,"Why is this so hard for you to get?
"
20709,"I thought you were a scientist.

"
20713,"Rach, so that guy there:
"
20714,"Straight or gay?
"
20715,"Oh, yeah, he's too cute
"
20716,"to be straight.
"
20717,"Knockers will help us
"
20718,"figure it out.
"
20719,"All right, straight.
"
20720,"And not subtle.
"
20721,"He left his cell phone.
"
20722,"We could have Gunther
"
20723,"put it in lost and found.
"
20724,"Or we could use it to call China,
"
20725,"see how those guys are doing.
"
20726,"What if he calls his own cell phone
"
20727,"and I answer...
"
20728,"...and we start talking
"
20729,"and we fell in love?
"
20730,"Would that be a great story?
"
20731,"Kind of like a fairy tale
"
20732,"for the digital age.
"
20733,"That does sound great.
"
20734,"I'm getting the phone.
"
20735,"What? Wait.
"
20736,"Why do you get the story?
"
20737,"I haven't been
"
20738,"out on a date in so long.
"
20739,"Phoebe, you had a date three days ago.
"
20740,"That wasn't a date. That was friends
"
20741,"getting together and having sex.
"
20742,"Okay. Great. I get the phone.
"
20743,"No way. You just broke up with Tag
"
20744,"a week ago.
"
20745,"Yeah, and until now, I didn't think
"
20746,"I would love again.
"
20747,"- Nice try.
"
20748,"- Wait.
"
20749,"How do we fairly decide
"
20750,"who gets the phone?
"
20751,"I don't know.
"
20752,"Maybe we could... .
"
20753,"Ah-ha! Too slow!
"
20754,"Ah-ha! Too cocky.
"
20755,"I'm dating him.
"
20756,"There's nothing you can do.
"
20757,"Yes, there is.
"
20758,"Are you going to kill him
"
20759,"like you did Charles?
"
20760,"Oh, my baby.
"
20761,"Cut! 
"
20762,"That was great. And that slap looked
"
20763,"so real. How do you do that?
"
20764,"- Oh, just years of experience.
"
20765,"- Can I get some ice here?!
"
20766,"I just wanted to say how wonderful
"
20767,"I think you are.
"
20768,"You're not the fan who's dying,
"
20769,"are you?
"
20770,"I'm Joey Tribbiani.
"
20771,"We did a scene together yesterday.
"
20772,"- I'm the guy in the coma.
"
20773,"- Oh, that was a real person?
"
20774,"Since I'm getting your brain
"
20775,"when you leave the show...
"
20776,"...I was wondering if...
"
20777,"- I'm leaving the show?
"
20778,"- Why? Did you hear something?
"
20779,"Who told you that?
"
20780,"- One of the writers.
"
20781,"- Was it bald or was it tall?
"
20782,"You know, it doesn't matter,
"
20783,"because it is not true.
"
20784,"Okay.
"
20785,"And if it were true, how dare you come
"
20786,"to me and ask me for tips...
"
20787,"...about a character I've played
"
20788,"for 20 years!
"
20789,"Miss Monroe...
"
20790,"Oh, there you go.
"
20791,"Okay, look, I have an idea.
"
20792,"Why don't we see what kind of numbers
"
20793,"he has on his speed dial...
"
20794,"...and then whoever has more in common
"
20795,"with him gets the phone.
"
20796,"- Fine. All right.
"
20797,"- All right.
"
20798,"First name on the speed dial is ""Mom. ""
"
20799,"Oh. I lost my mom to suicide.
"
20800,"You can't use that to get the cute guy
"
20801,"and the last blueberry muffin.
"
20802,"Did I use that already today? Sorry.
"
20803,"""Ben, Carlos, David...""
"
20804,"Oh, I win. He's got Barney's
"
20805,"on his speed dial.
"
20806,"You don't know it's Barney's
"
20807,"the store.
"
20808,"That could be his friend's
"
20809,"house, a bar...
"
20810,"Who has Barney's the store
"
20811,"on their speed dial?
"
20812,"His new girlfriend.
"
20813,"What is that?
"
20814,"I think it's the Dying Cat Parade.
"
20815,"Sounds like it's coming
"
20816,"from across the street.
"
20817,"- Oh, my God.
"
20818,"- What?
"
20819,"The thing that Ross was gonna
"
20820,"do at our wedding?
"
20821,"He was hanging out with me and said,
"
20822,"""You're half Scottish, right?""
"
20823,"No. There is no way.
"
20824,"It cannot be Ross.
"
20825,"Unbelievable.
"
20826,"Why is your family Scottish?
"
20827,"Why is your family Ross?
"
20828,"He cannot play at our wedding.
"
20829,"I mean, come on. That is just noise!
"
20830,"It's not even a song.
"
20831,"Wait. If you listen very carefully...
"
20832,"...I think it's ""Celebration""
"
20833,"by Kool and the Gang.
"
20834,"You're right.
"
20835,"They are writing me out of the show.
"
20836,"They don't know exactly when
"
20837,"it's going to happen, but soon...
"
20838,"...and then that's it.
"
20839,"If it was up to me,
"
20840,"you would never leave the show.
"
20841,"- Yeah, thanks.
"
20842,"- I mean it.
"
20843,"I can't believe they'd do this to you.
"
20844,"And to your fans.
"
20845,"They're gonna be devastated.
"
20846,"Heartbroken. They love you so much.
"
20847,"Oh, you're right.
"
20848,"Thank you.
"
20849,"What's your name again?
"
20850,"- Joey.
"
20851,"- Thank you.
"
20852,"That is so sweet.
"
20853,"The only reason
"
20854,"I came up to you before...
"
20855,"...is because, well...
"
20856,"...I'm really nervous about being you.
"
20857,"If you could help me capture
"
20858,"the essence of the character... .
"
20859,"Help me keep Jessica alive.
"
20860,"Please?
"
20861,"Joey, I will help you.
"
20862,"Not because I owe it
"
20863,"to this stupid show...
"
20864,"...but because I owe it to Jessica.
"
20865,"- Oh, thank you so much.
"
20866,"- You're so welcome.
"
20867,"I've been watching some tapes.
"
20868,"How's this?
"
20869,"Jessica Lockhart will never
"
20870,"step foot in this place again!
"
20871,"Never!
"
20872,"Jessica doesn't have
"
20873,"an English accent.
"
20874,"I can do an English accent?
"
20875,"That baby's going on my resume.
"
20876,"- Hi. How are you?
"
20877,"- Good.
"
20878,"Remember when we were
"
20879,"in the coffeehouse...
"
20880,"...we decided I was gonna keep
"
20881,"the cute guy's phone?
"
20882,"I was gonna keep it in my purse, so if
"
20883,"it rang, I could just pick it up?
"
20884,"Do you remember going into my purse
"
20885,"and stealing the phone?
"
20886,"Ooh, now you lost me.
"
20887,"- You stole the phone.
"
20888,"- No, I didn't.
"
20889,"You're saying if I called it,
"
20890,"it wouldn't ring?
"
20891,"- No.
"
20892,"- Okay.
"
20893,"But while you dial, let me show you
"
20894,"the features of my new ringing handbag.
"
20895,"Oh, it does work.
"
20896,"- Phoebe.
"
20897,"- That is a different phone.
"
20898,"Oh, is it? Hello. Yes, hi.
"
20899,"Is Rachel there?
"
20900,"Yes, she is. Just one moment, please.
"
20901,"It's for me!
"
20902,"That is damning evidence.
"
20903,"Oh, my God. I bet that's him.
"
20904,"My digital fairy tale's
"
20905,"about to begin.
"
20906,"Would you stop doing that?
"
20907,"Hello? Yes, I'm the one
"
20908,"who found your phone.
"
20909,"- Phoebe, you can't...
"
20910,"- Shh, I'm on a call.
"
20911,"Yeah, you can pick it up tonight.
"
20912,"Say, 8:30?
"
20913,"At my apartment.
"
20914,"It's 5 Morton Street,
"
20915,"apartment 14.
"
20916,"And then maybe, you know, after,
"
20917,"we can grab a bite to eat or whatever.
"
20918,"Okay. Okay, I'll see you then. Bye.
"
20919,"I will be here when he comes over.
"
20920,"How will you know what time
"
20921,"to come over?
"
20922,"You just said it.
"
20923,"Oh.
"
20924,"The essence of the character
"
20925,"is rooted in her confidence.
"
20926,"So when Jessica enters a room,
"
20927,"for instance...
"
20928,"...she owns everything...
"
20929,"...and every person in that room.
"
20930,"- You try it.
"
20931,"- Okay.
"
20932,"He's not mad at the room.
"
20933,"Try it again. He owns it.
"
20934,"He owns the room.
"
20935,"It is his. He owns, owns,
"
20936,"owns the room! He owns it!
"
20937,"It's a little weird,
"
20938,"but it's getting better.
"
20939,"I'm gonna miss this woman so much.
"
20940,"I don't know what I'm gonna do.
"
20941,"It's been 20 years of my life.
"
20942,"Hey, hey. Maybe this is a good thing.
"
20943,"It'll give you a chance to shake
"
20944,"things up. Play different characters.
"
20945,"You're so talented.
"
20946,"Probably should've just left years ago
"
20947,"when the offers were pouring in...
"
20948,"...but I just got
"
20949,"so comfy here and... .
"
20950,"I turned down some amazing work.
"
20951,"Like what?
"
20952,"Well, let's just say
"
20953,"if I'd left 15 years ago...
"
20954,"...the landscape of Mexican
"
20955,"cinema would be very different today.
"
20956,"Wow.
"
20957,"But, well, now... .
"
20958,"Now's a different time for me.
"
20959,"Oh, hey, come on. Don't do this.
"
20960,"Let me tell you something, okay?
"
20961,"When I watch you do a scene, I'm
"
20962,"thinking, ""She is a great actress. ""
"
20963,"But I'm also thinking, ""She is hot. ""
"
20964,"You think I'm hot?
"
20965,"You own the room.
"
20966,"We should probably get the... .
"
20967,"Oh, yeah. Yeah, we should get...
"
20968,"So when Jessica kisses a man...
"
20969,"...she usually puts...
"
20970,"...both her hands on the man's face.
"
20971,"I notice that.
"
20972,"Is that because she's so passionate?
"
20973,"No, it's because that way
"
20974,"the camera only sees her.
"
20975,"You want to try it?
"
20976,"Yeah, okay.
"
20977,"That was good. That was really good.
"
20978,"But I think that maybe your hands
"
20979,"are just a little off. They should...
"
20980,"Well, I feel like a snack.
"
20981,"Do you want some shortbread?
"
20982,"It's Scottish, like you are.
"
20983,"Oh, no, thanks. I don't like anything
"
20984,"from my Scottish heritage.
"
20985,"What?
"
20986,"Well, it's just that my entire family
"
20987,"was run out of Scotland by...
"
20988,"...Vikings.
"
20989,"It sounds like your family's ready
"
20990,"to rediscover its Scottish roots.
"
20991,"You can't play bagpipes
"
20992,"at the wedding!
"
20993,"How did you know?
"
20994,"- We heard you play from our apartment.
"
20995,"- Were you the ones who called the cops?
"
20996,"That's not really important right now.
"
20997,"What is important is, while we
"
20998,"appreciate the gesture...
"
20999,"...we just don't feel that bagpipes
"
21000,"are appropriate for our wedding.
"
21001,"- Why not?
"
21002,"- Because we hate them.
"
21003,"Just give me a chance to perform for
"
21004,"you, then decide whatever you want.
"
21005,"I'm not gonna tell you what song
"
21006,"I'm gonna play, either.
"
21007,"Let's just say when it's over...
"
21008,"...I'll bet there'll be
"
21009,"a wee bit o' celebration.
"
21010,"Hey, hey!
"
21011,"Who is it?
"
21012,"It's Tom.
"
21013,"I'm here to pick up the phone.
"
21014,"Why do you get to answer the door?
"
21015,"- Why shouldn't I?
"
21016,"- Because it's my apartment.
"
21017,"Then I get to give him the phone.
"
21018,"Okay. Good luck explaining
"
21019,"all the calls to China.
"
21020,"Hi.
"
21021,"Wow, how long were we arguing for?
"
21022,"You're not the man who left the phone.
"
21023,"- No, that's my assistant.
"
21024,"- Is he coming?
"
21025,"No.
"
21026,"- Could you give us one second?
"
21027,"- Sure.
"
21028,"We'll be right back, sir.
"
21029,"- What do we do?
"
21030,"- I don't know.
"
21031,"Can you believe this?
"
21032,"We were waiting for a hot guy
"
21033,"and a hotter one shows up.
"
21034,"I know...
"
21035,"What?
"
21036,"Rachel, listen...
"
21037,"...if you let me have him,
"
21038,"then I will really owe you one.
"
21039,"All right.
"
21040,"All right, I will let you have him.
"
21041,"But you owe me. You owe me big.
"
21042,"Which one of you will I
"
21043,"take to dinner?
"
21044,"Oh, that'd be me, sir.
"
21045,"Nice. 
"
21046,"Well, you certainly own that room.
"
21047,"Actually, I rent the whole place.
"
21048,"I just got what you meant. Thank you.
"
21049,"- Hi.
"
21050,"- Hey.
"
21051,"Oh, my God.
"
21052,"Oh, my God.
"
21053,"Oh, Jessica Lockhart!
"
21054,"In my apartment!
"
21055,"I am such a huge fan.
"
21056,"I am such a huge fan.
"
21057,"It's nice to know...
"
21058,"Monica!
"
21059,"That's my roommate, Rachel.
"
21060,"That explains the women's underwear.
"
21061,"Sure.
"
21062,"Oh, my God, it's true!
"
21063,"Can I just ask you to do me
"
21064,"just one favor?
"
21065,"Certainly.
"
21066,"Would you slap me
"
21067,"right here in the face?
"
21068,"I'd love to, but my lawyer said
"
21069,"I can't do that anymore.
"
21070,"All right, here we go.
"
21071,"No, wait. Just one moment.
"
21072,"- You're a stupid bitch.
"
21073,"- I really can't slap you.
"
21074,"- My God, you're great.
"
21075,"- Thanks for stopping by.
"
21076,"- I am so sorry about that.
"
21077,"- Oh, no.
"
21078,"Being adored, I'm used to it.
"
21079,"Don't worry about it.
"
21080,"- Oh, my God.
"
21081,"- What?
"
21082,"They sent me today's script.
"
21083,"They never send me the script.
"
21084,"- They don't?
"
21085,"- I'm in a coma.
"
21086,"This must mean I have lines.
"
21087,"Oh.
"
21088,"How does it happen?
"
21089,"You get thrown from a horse
"
21090,"into an electric fence.
"
21091,"A what? Jessica hates horses.
"
21092,"After this she's not gonna be crazy
"
21093,"about electricity, either.
"
21094,"Loosening the saddle on Mother's horse
"
21095,"was brilliant, Fredrick.
"
21096,"And the electric fence, inspired.
"
21097,"Thank you, sweetheart.
"
21098,"I can't believe she's really gone.
"
21099,"Look around you. All of this is ours.
"
21100,"I don't think so.
"
21101,"Who are you?
"
21102,"What's the matter, Dina?
"
21103,"Don't you recognize your own...
"
21104,"...mother?
"
21105,"Cut! That was great, everybody. 
"
21106,"Thank you. 
"
21107,"That was so wonderful!
"
21108,"I think that you're a better
"
21109,"Jessica than I ever was.
"
21110,"- Oh, no.
"
21111,"- Of course not, but you were good.
"
21112,"Thanks.
"
21113,"Good news. I got another job.
"
21114,"Great. Hey, all right! What is it?
"
21115,"A film in Guadalajara.
"
21116,"The airport?
"
21117,"No, that's LaGuardia.
"
21118,"- This is Mexico.
"
21119,"- Oh, wow.
"
21120,"Well, how long will you be gone?
"
21121,"Eight months.
"
21122,"- That's a really long time.
"
21123,"- Yeah, but you could come and visit.
"
21124,"I bet you could own
"
21125,"a few places down there.
"
21126,"Oh, you know, I should probably
"
21127,"buy a place in the city first.
"
21128,"And I just got what you meant.
"
21129,"That is...
"
21130,"- That's a tricky one.
"
21131,"- It's tricky.
"
21132,"Good luck.
"
21133,"You too.
"
21134,"Now, remember, I'm still learning.
"
21135,"One, two, three, four!
"
21136,"You know this song. Sing along.

"
21145,"Before we do, are any of Joey's

"
21149,"Thanks, Phoebe.

"
21152,"Could you do me a big favor?

21153,"I have a meeting

"
21155,"Can you watch Ben for an hour?
"
21156,"- What about Monica?
"
21157,"- She isn't home.
"
21158,"So it would just be me alone?
"
21159,"Ben would be there.
"
21160,"What's the matter?
"

"

21203,"What? It was my idea!
"
21204,"Thank you very much, but neither
"
21205,"of you is marrying us.
"
21206,"Does calling it not mean
"
21207,"anything anymore?
"

"

"
21223,"You know what, I had two sisters
"
21224,"and we just tortured each other.
"
21225,"- Really? Like how?
"
21226,"- Well, you know, we would, um...
"
21227,"...we'd repeat everything
"
21228,"the other said...
"
21229,"...or we'd jump out of closets
"
21230,"to scare each other...
"
21231,"...or switch the sugar with salt
"
21232,"so they put salt on their cereal.
"

"
21253,"...wondering if we're still together.
"
21254,"- We'll never find anybody.
"
21255,"- Then let me do it.
"
21256,"- Joey...
"
21257,"- I've been thinking.
"
21258,"I'm an actor, so I won't
"
21259,"get nervous in front of people.
"
21260,"I won't spit and I won't stare
"
21261,"at Monica's breasts.
"
21262,"Everyone knows I'm an ass man.
"
21263,"- That's true.
"
21264,"- The most important thing...
"
21265,"...is, it won't be some stranger
"
21266,"who barely knows you.
"
21267,"It'll be me. And I swear,
"
21268,"I'll do a really good job.
"
21269,"Plus, I love you guys and it
"
21270,"would really mean a lot to me.
"
21271,"Might be kind of cool.
"
21272,"- So I can do it?
"
21273,"- Yeah, you can do it.
"
21274,"All right! Okay!

21290,"- Yeah, that.
"
21291,"You know I hate practical jokes.
"
21292,"They're mean, they're stupid and
"
21293,"I don't want my son learning them.
"
21294,"Saran wrap on the toilet seat?
"
21295,"Isn't that just a little funny?
"
21296,"- I was barefoot.
"
21297,"- Oh.
"
21298,"Tell me, the toilet thing is the
"
21299,"only thing you taught him, right?
"
21300,"Yes.
"
21301,"- Hey.
"
21302,"- Say hello to Reverend Joey Tribbiani.
"
21303,"- You got ordained?
"
21304,"- Yeah.
"
21305,"Just got off the Internet.
"
21306,"Man, there's a lot of porn out there.
"
21307,"Our minister.
"
21308,"I started on what I'm gonna say
"
21309,"for the ceremony. Want to hear it?
"
21310,"Listen, this is just
"
21311,"the first draft, so... .
"
21312,"""We are gathered here today
"
21313,"on this joyous occasion...
"
21314,"...to celebrate the special love
"
21315,"that Monica and Chandler share.
"
21316,"It is a love based on
"
21317,"giving and receiving...
"
21318,"...as well as having and sharing.
"
21319,"And the love that they give
"
21320,"and have is shared and received.
"
21321,"And through this having and giving...
"
21322,"...and sharing and receiving...
"
21323,"...we too can share and love
"
21324,"and have...
"
21325,"...and receive. ""
"
21326,"Should we call the spitter?
"
21327,"- Hey, Rachel.
"
21328,"- Hi.
"
21329,"What a surprise.
"
21330,"What are you doing here?
"
21331,"I was just in the neighborhood...
"
21332,"...and I passed by your building and
"
21333,"thought, ""What's up with Carol...
"
21334,"...and sweet little Ben?""
"
21335,"- That's nice. Well, come on in.
"
21336,"- Okay.
"
21337,"I'll make some coffee
"
21338,"and we can chat.
"
21339,"I'd love that.
"
21340,"I would love that.
"
21341,"So where is sweet little Ben?
"
21342,"I would love to have a little...
"
21343,"I found him!
"
21344,"Very funny. Come here.
"
21345,"That is exactly why I've
"
21346,"come here to talk to you, okay?
"
21347,"- Rachel, you want sugar?
"
21348,"- Yes, but...
"
21349,"Do I want sugar in my coffee?
"
21350,"No, just some milk would
"
21351,"be good, Carol. Thanks.
"
21352,"Remember all that stuff
"
21353,"I taught you yesterday?
"
21354,"""Remember all that stuff
"
21355,"I taught you yesterday?""
"
21356,"- Don't do that.
"
21357,"- ""Don't do that. ""
"
21358,"- Your dad doesn't like pranks.
"
21359,"- ""Your dad doesn't like pranks. ""
"
21360,"- Oh, damn it.
"
21361,"- ""Oh, damn it! ""
"
21362,"No! Don't say that.
"
21363,"- Damn it!
"
21364,"- Go back to repeating.
"
21365,"- Damn it!
"
21366,"- Oh, crap.
"
21367,"""Oh, crap! ""
"
21368,"Okay, I got some more written, ready?
"
21369,"Yeah, okay.
"
21370,"""When I think of the love that these
"
21371,"two givers and receivers share...
"
21372,"...I can't help but envy the lifetime
"
21373,"ahead of having and loving...
"
21374,"...and giving..."" And then I can't
"
21375,"think of a good word for right here.
"
21376,"- How about ""receiving""?
"
21377,"- Yes!
"
21378,"See, Joe, not that that's not great...
"
21379,"...but one cool thing about having
"
21380,"a friend perform the ceremony...
"
21381,"...is that it can be about us.
"
21382,"It can be more personal.
"
21383,"You can tell stories about us.
"
21384,"Okay! Maybe I'll talk about London,
"
21385,"when you hooked up.
"
21386,"Only I won't say ""hooked up""...
"
21387,"...I'll say, ""began their
"
21388,"beautiful journey...
"
21389,"- There you go.
"
21390,"...by doing it. ""
"
21391,"- Joe.
"
21392,"- Okay, all right.
"
21393,"So how did it happen?
"
21394,"Did your eyes meet across the room...
"
21395,"...then you're in the bathtub
"
21396,"and she's feeding you strawberries?
"
21397,"- Isn't that what happened to you?
"
21398,"- Yeah!
"
21399,"I call that ""London style. ""
"
21400,"That didn't happen with us.
"
21401,"Maybe you should say it is,
"
21402,"because ""London style"" sounds nice.
"
21403,"Okay, uh... .
"
21404,"I was sad that night because
"
21405,"this guy thought I was Ross' mom.
"
21406,"And Chandler was really sweet
"
21407,"and he consoled me and...
"
21408,"...we drank too much.
"
21409,"- Yeah, baby.
"
21410,"I was a gentleman and I walked her to
"
21411,"her hotel room and said good night.
"
21412,"Oh.
"
21413,"- But then, later that night...
"
21414,"- Yeah, baby.
"
21415,"Cute P.J.s. Really living it up
"
21416,"here in London, huh?
"
21417,"Well, I wasn't exactly
"
21418,"expecting company after...
"
21419,"...9:15.
"
21420,"Is Joey here?
"
21421,"Last I saw he was with a bridesmaid
"
21422,"and a bucket of strawberries.
"
21423,"You're not still upset about
"
21424,"what that guy told you, are you?
"
21425,"Wouldn't you be?
"
21426,"It's been a really emotional time
"
21427,"and you've had a lot to drink... .
"
21428,"You have to let that go, okay?
"
21429,"You were the most beautiful
"
21430,"woman in the room tonight.
"
21431,"Really?
"
21432,"You kidding? You're the most
"
21433,"beautiful woman in most rooms...
"
21434,"Whoa, what's going on?
"
21435,"We just made out.
"
21436,"- We're making out?
"
21437,"- Not anymore.
"
21438,"- But we don't do that.
"
21439,"- I know, I thought it would be fun.
"
21440,"How drunk are you?
"
21441,"Enough to know I want to do this. Not
"
21442,"so much that you should feel guilty.
"
21443,"That's the perfect amount.
"
21444,"- You know what's weird?
"
21445,"- What?
"
21446,"- This doesn't feel weird.
"
21447,"- I know.
"
21448,"- You're a really good kisser.
"
21449,"- Well, I have kissed over four women.
"
21450,"Want to get under the covers?
"
21451,"Okay.
"
21452,"Wow, you are really fast!
"
21453,"It bodes well for me
"
21454,"that speed impresses you.
"
21455,"- We're gonna see each other naked.
"
21456,"- Yep.
"
21457,"- At the same time?
"
21458,"- Count of three?
"
21459,"One, two, three.
"
21460,"Well, I think it's safe to say
"
21461,"our friendship is effectively ruined.
"
21462,"Eh, we weren't that close anyway.
"
21463,"Joey, Joey, Joey...!
"
21464,"Hey.
"
21465,"Hey, Joe.
"
21466,"I was just watching a movie... .
"
21467,"Oh, dude, I'm so sorry.
"
21468,"No!
"
21469,"It's cool, I'm still
"
21470,"with my bridesmaid.
"
21471,"Where are the condoms?
"
21472,"In my bag over there.
"
21473,"Could you leave me one?
"
21474,"For just you?
"
21475,"Yeah.
"
21476,"All right. There you go, buddy.
"
21477,"Go nuts.
"
21478,"That's what that was?
"
21479,"If I hadn't left you one, you two
"
21480,"might've never gotten together.
"
21481,"Imagine if I had sent that hooker
"
21482,"like I was gonna?
"
21483,"It's like it was in the stars.
"
21484,"Yeah, totally meant to be.
"
21485,"Tell him who you originally
"
21486,"wanted to hook up with that night.
"
21487,"- What?
"
21488,"- What?
"
21489,"What?
"
21490,"Who did you originally
"
21491,"want to hook up with?
"
21492,"Okay, fine, but please don't be upset.
"
21493,"I was really depressed, okay?
"
21494,"And really drunk.
"
21495,"I wanted something stupid and
"
21496,"meaningless. I just wanted sex.
"
21497,"So, when I went to your
"
21498,"room that night...
"
21499,"...I was actually looking for Joey.
"
21500,"Yeah, baby.
"
21501,"No, baby.
"
21502,"Oh, my God.
"
21503,"You came looking for Joey?
"
21504,"- Were you planning on telling me this?
"
21505,"- No, I didn't think it was important.
"
21506,"It's not important?
"
21507,"It's not important?
"
21508,"If it wasn't for a bridesmaid,
"
21509,"you'd be marrying him.
"
21510,"Do you know how unbelievably
"
21511,"glad I am that Joey wasn't there?
"
21512,"Hey!
"
21513,"I'm a man of the cloth
"
21514,"but I still have feelings.
"
21515,"There's no way you're
"
21516,"doing this wedding now, okay?
"
21517,"What? That's not fair.
"
21518,"It's not my fault.
"
21519,"I was with my bridesmaid.
"
21520,"And who's to say
"
21521,"I would've said yes?
"
21522,"I mean, I would've said yes.
"
21523,"You are making way too
"
21524,"big a deal out of this.
"
21525,"Everything worked out okay.
"
21526,"It's just weird, okay?
"
21527,"I don't want to be saying my vows with
"
21528,"the mental image of you and Monica.
"
21529,"I need... I don't know what I need.
"
21530,"I need a walk.
"
21531,"- Wait, Chandler, it's not a big deal.
"
21532,"- It is to me.
"
21533,"You wanted to sleep with Batman
"
21534,"and settled for Robin.
"
21535,"- This is crazy.
"
21536,"- No, Robin is so gay.
"
21537,"- So now what have we agreed?
"
21538,"- No more pranks.
"
21539,"- What else?
"
21540,"- You and Daddy were not on a break.
"
21541,"Very good.
"
21542,"Rachel, what are you doing here?
"
21543,"I'm just visiting
"
21544,"my good friend Carol.
"
21545,"- Your good friend?
"
21546,"- Yeah.
"
21547,"What's her last name?
"
21548,"Carol...
"
21549,"...Lesbian.
"
21550,"- Nice.
"
21551,"By the way, that line down my face... .
"
21552,"The line that prompted a student
"
21553,"in my last class of the day to say:
"
21554,"""Dude, don't you ever wash your face?""
"
21555,"I'm sorry I didn't tell you.
"
21556,"I don't want you teaching my son
"
21557,"that stuff anymore.
"
21558,"- Okay?
"
21559,"- Fine. Fine.
"
21560,"Once I taught him that stuff,
"
21561,"he called me ""fun Aunt Rachel. ""
"
21562,"And I loved being fun Aunt Rachel.
"
21563,"I'm glad you guys were bonding but...
"
21564,"Look, he doesn't have any siblings.
"
21565,"Somebody has to teach him this stuff.
"
21566,"I haven't taught him anything
"
21567,"a normal 6-year-old doesn't know.
"
21568,"- Crap!
"
21569,"- I gotta go.
"
21570,"- Hey.
"
21571,"- Hey.
"
21572,"You want this scone? It came for me
"
21573,"but it would rather sleep with you.
"
21574,"Nothing even happened.
"
21575,"I just don't want you to be upset.
"
21576,"How can I not be upset?
"
21577,"I finally fall in love
"
21578,"with this fantastic woman...
"
21579,"...and it turns out
"
21580,"she wanted you first.
"
21581,"Yeah, for like a half an hour
"
21582,"one night.
"
21583,"Chandler, she wants you
"
21584,"for the rest of her life.
"
21585,"We look at you and we
"
21586,"see you together, and it just...
"
21587,"...it fits, you know?
"
21588,"And you just know
"
21589,"it's gonna last forever.
"
21590,"That's what you should say.
"
21591,"What?
"
21592,"When you're marrying us,
"
21593,"that's what you should say.
"
21594,"Really? I could do it?
"
21595,"I'd love you to do it.
"
21596,"Hey.
"
21597,"But those are the words.
"
21598,"Those exact words.
"
21599,"Well, I don't remember exactly but...
"
21600,"...it's pretty much about having
"
21601,"and giving and sharing and receiving.
"
21602,"- So you guys doing okay?
"
21603,"- Yeah.
"
21604,"We talked and Monica made me
"
21605,"see that I overreacted a little bit.
"
21606,"- Some things are more important.
"
21607,"- Yeah, baby.
"
21608,"I'm really glad you guys are okay,
"
21609,"but I just keep thinking...
"
21610,"...what would've happened
"
21611,"if you two had hooked up.
"
21612,"Honey, dinner's ready!
"
21613,"What's my little chef
"
21614,"got for me tonight?
"
21615,"- Your favorite.
"
21616,"- Ho, ho, ho...
"
21617,"...fried stuff with cheese.
"
21618,"And lots of it!
"
21619,"Thanks, sweetheart.
"
21620,"Give me a little sugar... .
"
21621,"Here we go, here we go, here we go.
"
21622,"How you doing?
"
21623,"- Hey.
"
21624,"- Hey!
"
21625,"I'm sorry to do this again, but
"
21626,"could you look after Ben for a bit?
"
21627,"I've got this meeting at school...
"
21628,"...and he asked for his
"
21629,"fun Aunt Rachel.
"
21630,"Well, of course I will watch him.
"
21631,"We have fun, don't we, Ben?
"
21632,"- See you later, pal.
"
21633,"- Okay.
"
21634,"Wait a minute. Ben, I can't do it.
"
21635,"- You got something on your back.
"
21636,"- What?
"
21637,"That's great. That is great.
"
21638,"What did we just finish
"
21639,"talking about, Ben?

"
21688,"I actually just moved
"
21689,"from four blocks over.
"
21690,"But this block is like another world.
"
21691,"Actually, it does have
"
21692,"a very interesting history.
"
21693,"This street is the first in the city
"
21694,"to have an underground sewer system.
"
21695,"Before that, sewage and waste...

"
21726,"- Thanks for the tip.
"
21727,"- When are you getting married?
"
21728,"- I'm not. I just like to try them on.
"
21729,"- I do the same thing.
"
21730,"I'm just kidding.
"
21731,"I'm getting married July 25th.
"
21732,"I'm just kidding too.
"
21733,"I'm getting married in December.
"
21734,"- When are you getting married?
"
21735,"- May 15th.
"
21736,"It's close.
"
21737,"Who's your photographer?
"
21738,"- Jeffrey.
"
21739,"- We met with him.
"
21740,"- Did he show you nude wedding photos?
"
21741,"- The Best Man? Wow!
"
21742,"I know.
"
21743,"I almost called off my wedding.
"
21744,"- Who's your band?
"
21745,"- My fiancï¿½ wants The Swing Kings.
"
21746,"You're lucky. My fiancï¿½ wants
"
21747,"the heavy metal band, Carcass.
"
21748,"Is that spelled with a ""C"" or a ""K""?
"
21749,"It doesn't matter, they're both great!
"
21750,"Oh, don't buy that here.
"
21751,"Now that you know what you want,
"
21752,"go to Kleinman's.
"
21753,"This place is so overpriced.
"
21754,"I own this store.
"
21755,"So does this come
"
21756,"in another color, or... .
"
21757,"Hi. You moving in or moving out?
"
21758,"- Moving in.
"
21759,"- Can I help out?
"
21760,"Okay, but be careful. The guy who was
"
21761,"helping before hurt his back.
"
21762,"- Boyfriend?
"
21763,"- No.
"
21764,"I'm Joey.
"
21765,"Kristen.
"
21766,"What a beautiful name.
"
21767,"What is it again?
"
21768,"Kristen.
"
21769,"- You live around here?
"
21770,"- Right down there.
"
21771,"Let me give you a tip.
"
21772,"Don't take a nap on this stoop.
"
21773,"You could wake up without shoes.
"
21774,"I'll remember that.
"
21775,"Listen, would you like
"
21776,"to have dinner with me tonight?
"
21777,"I have plans tonight.
"
21778,"How about tomorrow?
"
21779,"Sounds great.
"
21780,"Well, where does this go?
"
21781,"You look strong.
"
21782,"Why don't you grab one of the boxes.
"
21783,"Yeah, I'll get this one.
"
21784,"So this is Brooklyn?
"
21785,"Listen up. There's only
"
21786,"one dress in each size.
"
21787,"So when they open those doors,
"
21788,"fan out.
"
21789,"This is what you're looking for.
"
21790,"Memorize it.
"
21791,"When you locate the dress,
"
21792,"blow on these, all right?
"
21793,"Three sharp blasts.
"
21794,"When you hear it, come running.
"
21795,"Here he comes!
"
21796,"- They're pushing!
"
21797,"- Don't be a baby!
"
21798,"- Out of the way!
"
21799,"- Let's go!
"
21800,"Rachel?! Come on!
"
21801,"No, not it. Not it. Not it.
"
21802,"Don't crowd me.
"
21803,"This is it! This is the dress!
"
21804,"It's perfect!
"
21805,"I'm sorry, this one's taken!
"
21806,"- Megan!
"
21807,"- Monica!
"
21808,"- You came!
"
21809,"- Yeah!
"
21810,"- This is my dress!
"
21811,"- No!
"
21812,"- You saw me wearing it.
"
21813,"- And now you'll see me buying it.
"
21814,"You freak!
"
21815,"You wouldn't even know
"
21816,"about this place without me.
"
21817,"- Look, you don't want to fight me.
"
21818,"- Maybe I do. I'm pretty feisty!
"
21819,"- I'm coming! I'm coming!
"
21820,"- Hey!
"
21821,"Okay! Hey? Oh, what do I do?!
"
21822,"What are you doing?
"
21823,"Did you find the dress?
"
21824,"Did you find the dress?
"
21825,"No. You gotta get me out of here.
"
21826,"- We've gotta get Monica.
"
21827,"- You hold my hand!
"
21828,"Excuse me! Excuse me!
"
21829,"Go! Go! Go!
"
21830,"How was your date the other night?
"
21831,"Did you tell her about the magical
"
21832,"ride that starts with every flush?
"
21833,"Laugh all you want, but she said
"
21834,"she'd like to go out again.
"
21835,"In fact, I'll go call her right now.
"
21836,"And I'll make sure and tell her my
"
21837,"friend Chandler says... .
"
21838,"Sorry I didn't stop by last
"
21839,"night, but I had a date.
"
21840,"When it's 1:00 in the morning and you
"
21841,"don't come by, that's okay.
"
21842,"It was with this really hot girl
"
21843,"who moved in across the street.
"
21844,"- Right across the street?
"
21845,"- Yeah.
"
21846,"- When did you meet her?
"
21847,"- Two days ago.
"
21848,"Excellent!
"
21849,"You know, Ross met somebody too.
"
21850,"- Hey.
"
21851,"- How'd it go?
"
21852,"We're going out again Saturday.
"
21853,"But I found out she's
"
21854,"also seeing some other guy.
"
21855,"Really?
"
21856,"Joe, what would you do
"
21857,"if you were in Ross' situation?
"
21858,"I am. I'm dating this girl
"
21859,"who's also seeing another guy.
"
21860,"But I'm not worried about it.
"
21861,"You shouldn't be. I wouldn't want
"
21862,"to be the guy who's up against you.
"
21863,"I mean, that doofus is going to lose.
"
21864,"So this is nice.
"
21865,"I wish I didn't have to go.
"
21866,"Believe me.
"
21867,"But I have to.
"
21868,"So, what's the name
"
21869,"of the girl you're dating?
"
21870,"- Kristen Leigh.
"
21871,"- Bye.
"
21872,"Well, only one of us
"
21873,"can keep dating her.
"
21874,"Obviously. So how do we decide?
"
21875,"Well, now,
"
21876,"let's look at this objectively.
"
21877,"I think I should date her.
"
21878,"Or I'm the one who dates her.
"
21879,"That's interesting.
"
21880,"But check this out. I date her.
"
21881,"Okay, but to go
"
21882,"in another direction...
"
21883,"Okay. This can go on for a while.
"
21884,"- We should order some food then.
"
21885,"- No, Joey.
"
21886,"Look, why don't we
"
21887,"just let her decide, okay?
"
21888,"We'll each go out with her
"
21889,"one more time.
"
21890,"And we'll see who she likes best.
"
21891,"That sounds fair.
"
21892,"Maybe I'll take her
"
21893,"to that new French restaurant.
"
21894,"Wait a second.
"
21895,"We have to set a spending limit.
"
21896,"I can't take her
"
21897,"to a fancy place like that.
"
21898,"Well, sorry.
"
21899,"That's what I do on dates.
"
21900,"Well, I guess I'll just have to do
"
21901,"what I do on dates.
"
21902,"- So let's decide on a spending limit.
"
21903,"- Yeah.
"
21904,"And a slice...
"
21905,"...six dollars?
"
21906,"- I was thinking more like 100.
"
21907,"- Okay.
"
21908,"Can I borrow 94 dollars?
"
21909,"I know. Can you hand me a tissue?
"
21910,"You're out of Diet Coke.
"
21911,"Hello?
"
21912,"What? You what?
"
21913,"You listen here, missy!
"
21914,"Megan booked The Swing Kings
"
21915,"on the day of our wedding...
"
21916,"...and said she'd only
"
21917,"give them back for the dress!
"
21918,"Does that mean Carcass is available?
"
21919,"What am I gonna do? That's the dress!
"
21920,"That is ""the"" dress!
"
21921,"Chandler wants the band.
"
21922,"What do I do?
"
21923,"- Figure out how to talk him out of it.
"
21924,"- How?
"
21925,"You're out of toilet paper!
"
21926,"I wanted to wish you good luck
"
21927,"on your date.
"
21928,"- Thanks.
"
21929,"- What time are you meeting?
"
21930,"We have reservations
"
21931,"at Grand Merci Bistro at 8.
"
21932,"That's in 20 minutes.
"
21933,"You'd better get dressed.
"
21934,"- I am dressed.
"
21935,"- Oh, well, good.
"
21936,"For me.
"
21937,"What's this?
"
21938,"Did you give yourself a facial?
"
21939,"I have an oily T-zone.
"
21940,"Okay, dude.
"
21941,"- You sent Kristen flowers?
"
21942,"- That's right.
"
21943,"You spent 100 dollars.
"
21944,"That's the limit. You're screwed!
"
21945,"I sent the flowers before
"
21946,"the actual date, so technically...
"
21947,"...I didn't break any rules.
"
21948,"Thanks for stopping by though.
"
21949,"That's how it's gonna be?
"
21950,"I can break the rules too.
"
21951,"- What are you gonna do?
"
21952,"- I don't know.
"
21953,"- I'm not surprised.
"
21954,"- You won't get away with this.
"
21955,"- You don't have much choice.
"
21956,"- We'll see!
"
21957,"Hey! So, just a light layer?
"
21958,"Yeah, just here and there.
"
21959,"Joey got meat sauce
"
21960,"on the banister again.
"
21961,"Swing music is so out.
"
21962,"He's gotta be in the room
"
21963,"for that to work.
"
21964,"What are you guys talking about?
"
21965,"We're talking about The Swing Kings...
"
21966,"...and whether they're
"
21967,"the right way to go.
"
21968,"I went to a wedding
"
21969,"where they had swing music...
"
21970,"...two months later
"
21971,"the couple divorced.
"
21972,"I'm not saying
"
21973,"there's any connection here...
"
21974,"...but they did say
"
21975,"that's why they got divorced.
"
21976,"But I love swing music!
"
21977,"But The Swing Kings?
"
21978,"They suck so much that people die at
"
21979,"their concerts. They stop living.
"
21980,"When Monica and I went to see them,
"
21981,"we had fun.
"
21982,"And there's another reason.
"
21983,"- Well, what is the other reason?
"
21984,"- I don't want to say.
"
21985,"Well, you have to,
"
21986,"because maybe it's stupid.
"
21987,"It's just, while Monica and I
"
21988,"were dancing to them...
"
21989,"...it was the first time
"
21990,"I knew that...
"
21991,"...you were the woman that I wanted
"
21992,"to dance all my dances with.
"
21993,"Oh, crap.
"
21994,"- Our table will be ready soon.
"
21995,"- Oh, great.
"
21996,"- Is your back feeling better?
"
21997,"- That's fine.
"
21998,"I guess the more muscles you have...
"
21999,"...the more they can
"
22000,"spasm out of control.
"
22001,"- Kristen?
"
22002,"- Joey!
"
22003,"- What are you doing here?
"
22004,"- I like this place.
"
22005,"And technically, I'm not
"
22006,"breaking any rules, so... .
"
22007,"Well, Ross, this is Joey.
"
22008,"Joey, Ross.
"
22009,"- Hi.
"
22010,"- Hi. It's nice to meet you.
"
22011,"I used to have a friend named Joey.
"
22012,"I don't anymore.
"
22013,"Our table will be ready
"
22014,"in a couple minutes.
"
22015,"Sure! I would love
"
22016,"to wait with you guys! Thanks!
"
22017,"So, Joey, you look familiar.
"
22018,"Are you on TV or something?
"
22019,"He doesn't like to talk about it...
"
22020,"...but he's one of the stars
"
22021,"of Days of Our Lives. 
"
22022,"That's right. Don't you play a woman?
"
22023,"A woman in a man's body.
"
22024,"Much better.
"
22025,"It's funny, because you
"
22026,"look familiar to me too.
"
22027,"Have you ever been married?
"
22028,"Yes, I have.
"
22029,"In fact, just the other day...
"
22030,"...Kris and I talked about how
"
22031,"I've been married and have a son.
"
22032,"- Little Eric.
"
22033,"- That's right. Wait. No, Ben.
"
22034,"So you've just been married
"
22035,"the one time then?
"
22036,"- Well... .
"
22037,"- You've been married twice?
"
22038,"Yes. And...
"
22039,"...another time after that.
"
22040,"Boy, I'm getting hungry.
"
22041,"Have you ever been so hungry
"
22042,"on a date...
"
22043,"...that when the girl goes to the
"
22044,"bathroom, you eat her food?
"
22045,"You said the waiter ate my crab cake.
"
22046,"So, Ross, now why did
"
22047,"that first marriage break up?
"
22048,"Was it because the woman was straight
"
22049,"or because she was a lesbian?
"
22050,"- Do you two know each other?
"
22051,"- No.
"
22052,"But he seems like
"
22053,"a guy who'd marry a woman...
"
22054,"...on the verge of being a lesbian
"
22055,"and then push her over the edge.
"
22056,"Wait a minute!
"
22057,"Were you on a poster for gonorrhea?
"
22058,"Have you ever slept
"
22059,"in the same bed with a monkey?
"
22060,"You leave Marcel out of this!
"
22061,"Fine! You ever gotten stuck
"
22062,"in a pair of leather pants?
"
22063,"Have you ever locked yourself
"
22064,"in a TV cabinet, VD-boy?
"
22065,"Monkey-lover!
"
22066,"Where do you think we lost her?
"
22067,"Probably around gonorrhea.
"
22068,"- Hi, honey, I'm home!
"
22069,"- Don't come in here!
"
22070,"Why, do you have another
"
22071,"boyfriend in there?
"
22072,"No. We only mess around at his place.
"
22073,"I started it, but now it's scaring me,
"
22074,"so could you come out here?
"
22075,"I'm wearing a wedding dress.
"
22076,"You got a wedding dress?
"
22077,"- Yeah, but I'm not keeping it.
"
22078,"- Then why can't I see it?
"
22079,"Oh. I guess you can.
"
22080,"But I have to return it,
"
22081,"so you can't like it.
"
22082,"Okay, I promise. I'll hate it.
"
22083,"Wow. You look hideous.
"
22084,"Really?
"
22085,"Yeah. That's like the most
"
22086,"ugliest dress I've ever seen.
"
22087,"Why do you have to return it?
"
22088,"Because it doesn't really fit.
"
22089,"Oh, I booked The Swing Kings.
"
22090,"Oh, that's great. Thanks.
"
22091,"But that dress is terrible.
"
22092,"- It makes me want to rip it off you.
"
22093,"- Okay.
"
22094,"But you can't rip it.
"
22095,"Well, maybe a little.
"
22096,"Guys, you want to look
"
22097,"at the song list for the wedding?
"
22098,"Guys?
"
22099,"I thought you'd be gone all day.
"
22100,"All right, what's going on?
"
22101,"I'm sorry. I should probably
"
22102,"leave you girls alone.
"
22103,"Laugh all you want, but in 10 minutes
"
22104,"we'll have younger-looking skin.
"
22105,"You know, she could use a little... .
"
22106,"Oh, nice shot! Yeah!

"
22111,"I'm sorry. Too soon. You go.
"
22112,"I got nominated for
"

"
22115,"- Congratulations!
"
22116,"I can't believe you're nominated

"
22118,"- Soap Opera Digest Award?
"
22119,"- No. I'm up for a ""Soapie. ""
"
22120,"Is that something you're making up?
"
22121,"No, no, no, it's real!
"
22122,"And it has been, since 1998.
"
22123,"I'm up for a Soapie!
"
22124,"Oh, my God!
"
22125,"My God! That's the third most

"
22129,"Don't kid about that!
"
22130,"Will all the stars be there?
"
22131,"Many are scheduled to appear.
"
22132,"- I can't go. I'll be too nervous!
"
22133,"- I'll go.

22139,"Ernest Muhlbrat hypothesized that the
"
22140,"velociraptor, when threatened...
"
22141,"...would expand its collar and
"
22142,"emit a high-pitched noise...
"
22143,"...to frighten off predators.
"
22144,"Mr. Lewis?
"
22145,"What kind of noise?
"
22146,"Just a high-pitched,
"
22147,"intimidating noise.
"
22148,"But like how?
"
22149,"Well, we don't know for sure.
"
22150,"But in my head,
"
22151,"it sounded something like this:
"
22152,"Of course, this is just conjecture.
"
22153,"Okay. That's all for today.
"
22154,"Mr. Morse,
"
22155,"can I see you for a moment?
"
22156,"Yes, sir?
"
22157,"I need to talk to you

22159,"- I'm afraid I had to fail you.
"
22160,"- Why?
"
22161,"Well, you need 60% to pass.
"
22162,"- What did I get?
"
22163,"- Seven.
"
22164,"That's not so good.
"
22165,"No, no, it's not.
"
22166,"What happened, Ned?
"
22167,"Maybe you can cut me some slack.
"
22168,"I'm sort of in love.
"
22169,"I'm sorry, but that's
"
22170,"really not my problem.
"
22171,"I'm in love with you.
"
22172,"That brings me in the loop a little.
"
22173,"That's why I did so bad on this test.
"
22174,"I'm having a hard time concentrating.
"
22175,"When you're up there
"
22176,"and you're teaching...
"
22177,"...and your face gets all serious... .
"
22178,"You look so good. When you wear that
"
22179,"tight little turtleneck sweater...
"
22180,"I'm your teacher. I'm sorry.
"
22181,"You're a student.
"
22182,"And I like women.
"
22183,"In spite of what may be written
"
22184,"on the backs of these chairs.
"
22185,"That guy at the counter's
"
22186,"totally checking you out.
"
22187,"Really?
"
22188,"- Oh, my God, he's really cute!
"
22189,"- Go for it.
"
22190,"Phoebe, I'm engaged.
"
22191,"I'm saying, get his number,
"
22192,"just in case.
"
22193,"But if Chandler's in an accident
"
22194,"and can't perform sexually...
"
22195,"...he'd want you to take a lover to
"
22196,"satisfy needs he'd no longer fulfill.
"
22197,"Can I just tell you something?
"
22198,"I'm very flattered, but I'm engaged.
"
22199,"This is kind of embarrassing.
"
22200,"I actually came over
"
22201,"to talk to your friend.
"
22202,"You should be embarrassed.
"
22203,"- I thought you knew I looked at you.
"
22204,"- I did, but that was really fun.
"
22205,"""The winner is... Joey Tribbiani! ""
"
22206,"""I honestly never expected this.
"
22207,"I didn't prepare a speech.
"
22208,"I'd like to thank my parents,
"
22209,"who've always been there for me.
"
22210,"Also like to thank my friends,
"
22211,"Chandler, Monica, Phoebe, Rachel...""
"
22212,"- I'm fourth?
"
22213,"- Jeez!
"
22214,"Look at you with your
"
22215,"maple syrup award!
"
22216,"Maybe you don't tell anyone
"
22217,"about this?
"
22218,"No big deal.
"
22219,"I do that with my shampoo bottle.
"
22220,"- Really?
"
22221,"- Yeah.
"
22222,"- What award are you practicing for?
"
22223,"- Grammy.
"
22224,"For Best New Artist.
"
22225,"The Soapies people called today.
"
22226,"I also get to present an award.
"
22227,"So you'll get on stage
"
22228,"even if you don't win.
"
22229,"- You don't think I'll win?
"
22230,"- Of course I do.
"
22231,"But Favorite Returning Character?
"
22232,"That's a tough category.
"
22233,"You're up against the guy who
"
22234,"survived his own cremation.
"
22235,"No, I know I might not win.
"
22236,"But it's just... .
"
22237,"I've never been nominated.
"
22238,"I want it so much.
"
22239,"You'll probably get it.
"
22240,"But you should start practicing
"
22241,"your ""gracious-loser"" face.
"
22242,"When the cameras are on you,
"
22243,"you want to look disappointed.
"
22244,"But also that your colleague
"
22245,"deserved to win. Like:
"
22246,"You know?
"
22247,"- You practice losing the Grammys too?
"
22248,"- No, at the Grammys, I always win.
"
22249,"- Hey!
"
22250,"- How'd your date go with Jake?
"
22251,"Great. We couldn't keep
"
22252,"our eyes off each other.
"
22253,"Every once in a while, he'd lean over,
"
22254,"stroke my hair, then touch my neck.
"
22255,"Stop it. You're getting me
"
22256,"all tingly.
"
22257,"All I could think of was,
"
22258,"is he gonna kiss me?
"
22259,"- Did he?
"
22260,"- I'm a lady. I don't kiss and tell.
"
22261,"But this hickey speaks for itself.
"
22262,"Okay, I got it. I got it.
"
22263,"I like him so much, I feel like
"
22264,"I've had 10 drinks today.
"
22265,"I've only had six.
"
22266,"I haven't had that feeling since
"
22267,"I first went out with Chandler.
"
22268,"- I'll never have that feeling again.
"
22269,"- You sound like a guy.
"
22270,"No, a guy would say, ""I'll never
"
22271,"get to sleep with anyone else. ""
"
22272,"I'll never sleep with anyone else!
"
22273,"I'm so busy planning the wedding,
"
22274,"I forgot about what I'll give up.
"
22275,"I'll never have a first kiss again.
"
22276,"You'll have a last kiss.
"
22277,"Can I ask you something? Has
"
22278,"a guy ever had a crush on you?
"
22279,"Is that why you wanted to tie my tie?
"
22280,"A kid in my class said
"
22281,"he's in love with me.
"
22282,"Whoa!
"
22283,"- Whoa, what?
"
22284,"- Ross has a boyfriend!
"
22285,"I do not have a boyfriend.
"
22286,"There's a guy in one of my classes
"
22287,"who has a crush on me.
"
22288,"- Really?
"
22289,"- Yeah.
"
22290,"Last year, Elizabeth, now this kid... .
"
22291,"What is it?
"
22292,"Am I giving out some kind of...
"
22293,"...sexy-professor vibe?
"
22294,"Not right now.
"
22295,"The point is, my natural charisma has
"
22296,"made him fail his midterm.
"
22297,"Now I feel bad for the kid.
"
22298,"I had a crush on a teacher once,
"
22299,"and it was so hard.
"
22300,"I couldn't concentrate.
"
22301,"I blushed every time he looked at me.
"
22302,"You remember what it's like
"
22303,"to be 19 and in love.
"
22304,"- I can cut him some slack.
"
22305,"- Yeah.
"
22306,"- How'd you get over that teacher?
"
22307,"- I didn't. I got under him.
"
22308,"Problem solved.
"
22309,"- Bye, Phoebe.
"
22310,"- Okay, bye.
"
22311,"- All right. Bye.
"
22312,"- Bye.
"
22313,"We said goodbye at the door
"
22314,"so as not to flaunt our new love.
"
22315,"It's okay.
"
22316,"You don't have to tiptoe around me.
"
22317,"I've thought about it.
"
22318,"You know what?
"
22319,"I'm okay, not having that
"
22320,"new-relationship feeling.
"
22321,"- I miss you already!
"
22322,"- I miss you too!
"
22323,"That's great, but I wouldn't
"
22324,"trade what I have for that.
"
22325,"I'll be with Chandler the rest
"
22326,"of my life. That makes me happy.
"
22327,"Come sit down. We're talking
"
22328,"about how our relationship's deep...
"
22329,"...and meaningful.
"
22330,"It is, don't you think?
"
22331,"Oh, totally.
"
22332,"Pull my finger.
"
22333,"- Favorite Returning Male...
"
22334,"- This is my category!
"
22335,"- Got your speech?
"
22336,"- Got my speech.
"
22337,"Got your gracious-loser face?
"
22338,"Try to remember, if you win,
"
22339,"you have to hug me.
"
22340,"Can I squeeze your ass?
"
22341,"On TV?
"
22342,"Yeah!
"
22343,"In the Favorite Returning Male
"
22344,"character category, the nominees are:
"
22345,"John Wheeler from General Hospital. 
"
22346,"Gavin Graham from
"
22347,"The Young and the Restless.

"
22349,"And Joey Tribbiani from
"
22350,"Days of Our Lives. 
"
22351,"And the Soapie goes to:
"
22352,"Gavin Graham from
"
22353,"The Young and the Restless. 
"
22354,"Presenting the Favorite Supporting
"
22355,"Actress award:
"
22356,"Joey Tribbiani from
"
22357,"Days of Our Lives. 
"
22358,"Any one of the brilliant actresses
"
22359,"nominated for this award...
"
22360,"...deserves to take it home.
"
22361,"Unfortunately, only one can.
"
22362,"The nominees for
"
22363,"Favorite Supporting Actress are:
"
22364,"From Passions, Erin Goff.
"
22365,"From One Life to Live,  Mary Lauren

"
22368,"Jessica Ashley.
"
22369,"And the winner is:
"
22370,"Jessica Ashley from Days of Our Lives. 
"
22371,"Unfortunately, Jessica
"
22372,"couldn't be with us tonight...
"
22373,"...so I'll accept this award
"
22374,"on her behalf.
"
22375,"And I'm sure that Jessica...
"
22376,"...wants to thank my parents...
"
22377,"...who always believed in me.
"
22378,"She'd also like to thank my friends:
"
22379,"Chandler, Monica, Ross,
"
22380,"Phoebe and Rachel...
"
22381,"...who's sitting right there.
"
22382,"Why'd we rush out so fast?
"
22383,"We had to get out of there
"
22384,"because... Look what I won!
"
22385,"Oh, my God. You stole her award!
"
22386,"No, no, no. I'm accepting it
"
22387,"on her behalf.
"
22388,"I don't think you know
"
22389,"what ""behalf"" means.
"
22390,"Sure I do. It's a verb.
"
22391,"As in ""I be half-in' it""!
"
22392,"- You've got to take this back.
"
22393,"- I should've won. I really wanted it.
"
22394,"She didn't care enough to come to the
"
22395,"thing. It could also be a Grammy.
"
22396,"No, Joey.
"
22397,"No one saw me take it.
"
22398,"There's a whole table of them.
"
22399,"Do you want an award you didn't win?
"
22400,"No, I want an award I did win.
"
22401,"But nobody's given me any of those!
"
22402,"If I put it up, when people come over,
"
22403,"they'll see it...
"
22404,"...and think I won it.
"
22405,"Joey, it says
"
22406,"""Best Supporting Actress. ""
"
22407,"I can scratch that right off.
"
22408,"This is wrong.
"
22409,"You have to take it back.
"
22410,"You don't want to win an award
"
22411,"this way. You're very talented.
"
22412,"Someday you'll win one of these for
"
22413,"real and that one will mean something.
"
22414,"- Oh, all right.
"
22415,"- All right? Thank you.
"
22416,"I'll take it back tomorrow.
"
22417,"If I can't have it,
"
22418,"you can't have it!
"
22419,"- Professor Geller?
"
22420,"- Yes, Mr. Lewis? How can I help you?
"
22421,"I know I didn't do well
"
22422,"on my midterms and stuff.
"
22423,"But I was hoping you could
"
22424,"change my grade.
"
22425,"And why, exactly, would I do that?
"
22426,"Because I'm in love with you.
"
22427,"What?
"
22428,"Yeah. I'm all in love
"
22429,"with you and stuff.
"
22430,"- So could you change my grade?
"
22431,"- No!
"
22432,"Why not? You changed Ned's grade.
"
22433,"That's different. Because he was
"
22434,"actually in love with me.
"
22435,"No, he's not!
"
22436,"He's totally yanking your chain.
"
22437,"He's done this with
"
22438,"three other teachers.
"
22439,"- What?
"
22440,"- He's got a girlfriend.
"
22441,"I can't believe someone
"
22442,"would do that for a grade.
"
22443,"I know.
"
22444,"It's awful.
"
22445,"I love you.
"
22446,"- Have you seen Chandler?
"
22447,"- No, why?
"
22448,"I keep thinking about all
"
22449,"the things I won't have.
"
22450,"It's freaking me out.
"
22451,"I don't know what to do.
"
22452,"Don't sweat it.
"
22453,"Chandler's not around, so get it
"
22454,"out of your system. That guy's cute.
"
22455,"Come on, I'm serious.
"
22456,"- I've got to talk to him about this.
"
22457,"- That's the last thing you want to do.
"
22458,"- Why?
"
22459,"- Because you're marrying him!
"
22460,"You gotta help me out here.
"
22461,"I've never been engaged.
"
22462,"I've never really been married.
"
22463,"I can only tell you
"
22464,"what my mother told me.
"
22465,"When you have doubts or fears or
"
22466,"anxieties about a relationship...
"
22467,"...don't communicate them
"
22468,"to your husband.
"
22469,"I'm not supposed to share
"
22470,"my doubts and fears...
"
22471,"...with the guy I'm spending
"
22472,"the rest of my life with?
"
22473,"That is correct. Yes.
"
22474,"You're supposed to put all that stuff
"
22475,"in a little box in your mind...
"
22476,"...and lock it up.
"
22477,"Your mother told you this?
"
22478,"The woman who married a bunch of times
"
22479,"and killed herself when you were 13?
"
22480,"Oh, my God, you're right.
"
22481,"Tell Chandler.
"
22482,"Hurry, before it's too late!
"
22483,"Wait! Does this also mean that
"
22484,"putting out doesn't get you love?
"
22485,"- I'm gonna meet Jessica Ashley!
"
22486,"- Wait, wait.
"
22487,"Rach, please be cool, okay?
"
22488,"I work with this woman.
"
22489,"Okay, I'm totally cool.
"
22490,"Come in.
"
22491,"Hey, Jessica.
"
22492,"Hey, Jess.
"
22493,"This is my friend Rachel.
"
22494,"- Hi.
"
22495,"- What's up?
"
22496,"Here's your Soapie.
"
22497,"I accepted it for you.
"
22498,"Oh, my God. I won?
"
22499,"Do you have any idea what this means?
"
22500,"You're not gonna put it
"
22501,"on your shelf or anything?
"
22502,"No, I try to save that for real
"
22503,"awards. Now if you'll excuse me?
"
22504,"- Take it back?
"
22505,"- Absolutely.
"
22506,"Yeah, you do!
"
22507,"Honey?
"
22508,"As we get closer to the wedding...
"
22509,"...is there anything
"
22510,"you'd like to share?
"
22511,"Okay. I think the centerpieces
"
22512,"are too big.
"
22513,"You're wrong.
"
22514,"The centerpieces are fine.
"
22515,"- Do you ever get scared at all?
"
22516,"- Kind of. They're really big.
"
22517,"Doesn't it freak you out that you'll
"
22518,"never be with anybody new again?
"
22519,"What?
"
22520,"I love you so much.
"
22521,"Sometimes it bothers me that
"
22522,"I'll never have that feeling.
"
22523,"When you first meet someone...
"
22524,"...and it's new and exciting.
"
22525,"You know that rush?
"
22526,"No, when I first meet somebody...
"
22527,"...it's mostly panic, anxiety
"
22528,"and a great deal of sweating.
"
22529,"Okay. But you're a guy.
"
22530,"Aren't you freaked out that you'll
"
22531,"never sleep with anybody else?
"
22532,"Sleeping with somebody, no.
"
22533,"Anxiety, panic and, I'm afraid,
"
22534,"even more sweating.
"
22535,"Even with me?
"
22536,"I was dangerously dehydrated the
"
22537,"first six months of our relationship.
"
22538,"For me, the rush is knowing that we'll
"
22539,"be together the rest of our lives.
"
22540,"- Really?
"
22541,"- Well, yeah.
"
22542,"Knowing you're having these thoughts,
"
22543,"we're back to panic, anxiety and...
"
22544,"...I'll definitely need
"
22545,"some kind of sports drink.
"
22546,"Come here. Oh, you don't
"
22547,"have to worry.
"
22548,"Besides, you know what? I'll have
"
22549,"a lot of new things with you.
"
22550,"The first time we buy a house. Our
"
22551,"first kid. Our first grandkid.
"
22552,"Water. Water. Water.
"
22553,"Mr. Morse? Can I speak to you
"
22554,"for a moment?
"
22555,"That was a great lecture today.
"
22556,"Did you get a little haircut?
"
22557,"Yeah, yeah. Do you like it?
"
22558,"Do you love it?
"
22559,"I want you to know I'm
"
22560,"changing your grade back.
"
22561,"What? Why?
"
22562,"I know what you're trying
"
22563,"to pull here. It won't work.
"
22564,"I'm not trying to pull anything.
"
22565,"Look, I love you, dude.
"
22566,"I'm not even gonna talk about this.
"
22567,"This little ""thing"" is over.
"
22568,"I know you have a girlfriend.
"
22569,"And I know about the other professors.
"
22570,"How do you think that makes me feel?
"
22571,"You used me!
"
22572,"You don't love me and you never did!
"
22573,"Professor Winston.
"
22574,"Professor Frederickson.
"
22575,"I'll be right with you.
"
22576,"Don't make this worse and I'll
"
22577,"give you a ""C. "" Shall we?
"
22578,"I'll be out in a second.
"
22579,"""It's just so unexpected!

"
22590,"Thank you, Neil.
"
22591,"Thank you for the words. ""
"
22592,"Finish this later.
"
22593,"We're gonna be late.
"
22594,"Please don't play the music.
"
22595,"Just one more thing.
"
22596,"Okay. ""Live from New York,
"
22597,"it's Saturday Night! ""

"
22599,"Oh, hey! How was your audition?
"
22600,"I'm sorry, do I know you?
"
22601,"What are you doing?
"
22602,"Practicing blowing you off.
"
22603,"I'm gonna be a big movie star!
"
22604,"You got it?
"
22605,"- Not yet, but the audition went great!
"
22606,"- What's it for?
"
22607,"A big-budget period movie about
"
22608,"three Italian brothers...
"
22609,"...who come to America at the turn
"
22610,"of the century. It's classy.
"
22611,"The director's supposed to be
"
22612,"the next-next Martin Scorsese.
"
22613,"The ""next-next""?
"
22614,"A guy from Chicago's supposed to be
"
22615,"the next Martin Scorsese.
"
22616,"This guy's right after him.
"
22617,"Hello?
"
22618,"Joey, it's Estelle. I just talked to
"
22619,"the casting people. They loved you!
"
22620,"They loved me!
"
22621,"They want to see you again tomorrow.
"
22622,"- My God!
"
22623,"-There's just one thing. 
"
22624,"Do you have a problem
"
22625,"with full-frontal nudity?
"
22626,"Are you kidding me? I never
"
22627,"rent a movie without it!
"
22628,"Oh.
"
22629,"Okay, let me call you back.
"
22630,"- What's the matter?
"
22631,"- They want me naked in the movie.
"
22632,"- Wow!
"
22633,"- I know.
"
22634,"- My grandmother's gonna see this.
"
22635,"- Grandma's gonna have to get in line.

"
22639,"The wedding's so close.
"
22640,"Are you nervous?
"
22641,"Yeah, but I also can't
"
22642,"wait till it's over.
"
22643,"We have a pact not to have sex
"
22644,"again until the wedding.
"
22645,"A ""no sex"" pact, huh?
"
22646,"I have one of those with
"
22647,"every woman in America.
"
22648,"Will you give me a hand
"
22649,"making up the guest bedroom?
"
22650,"Cousin Cassie's staying with us
"
22651,"for a few days.
"
22652,"Cassie? I haven't seen her
"
22653,"in, like, forever.
"
22654,"I wonder if she still carries
"
22655,"a Barbie everywhere?
"
22656,"- She's 25 years old.
"
22657,"- So? I still...
"
22658,"You're probably right.
"
22659,"Pheebs, can I talk to you
"
22660,"over here for a second?
"
22661,"Subtle, guys.
"
22662,"What?
"
22663,"I know you're planning my
"
22664,"surprise bridal shower.
"
22665,"Okay, well, don't ruin it.
"
22666,"Just play along, at least.
"
22667,"Okay. Sorry.
"
22668,"We have to throw her a shower?
"
22669,"What'd you decide to do
"
22670,"about the movie?
"
22671,"I don't know.
"
22672,"It's not like it's porn.
"
22673,"This is a serious, legitimate movie.
"
22674,"Nudity's really important
"
22675,"to the story.
"
22676,"That's what you say about porn.
"
22677,"Maybe I shouldn't go on the callback.
"
22678,"No, you should. A lot of major
"
22679,"actors do nude scenes.
"
22680,"The chance to star in a movie?
"
22681,"Come on!
"
22682,"That's true. And I'm only naked in
"
22683,"one scene. It sounds really great.
"
22684,"My character's Catholic. He falls
"
22685,"in love with a Jewish girl.
"
22686,"We run away and get caught
"
22687,"in a big rainstorm.
"
22688,"We go into a barn, undress each other
"
22689,"and hold each other.
"
22690,"It's really sweet and tender.
"
22691,"Plus, everyone will see your thing!
"
22692,"When can we have this shower?
"
22693,"She has so much going on,
"
22694,"we have only two options.
"
22695,"- We have Friday.
"
22696,"- That's just two days away.
"
22697,"- What is the other option?
"
22698,"- Yesterday.
"
22699,"If we make it yesterday, we're done!
"
22700,"It's impossible.
"
22701,"We can't do this by Friday.
"
22702,"We have to find a place,
"
22703,"invite people, get food.
"
22704,"There's too much to do.
"
22705,"- We cannot do it!
"
22706,"- Calm down!
"
22707,"Okay. I'm sorry, you're right.
"
22708,"I'm sorry.
"
22709,"Just calm down, woman!
"
22710,"Phoebe, I already did.
"
22711,"All right, then I need to calm down.
"
22712,"I think we can do this
"
22713,"if we just get organized.
"
22714,"We have two days to plan this party.
"
22715,"We need to make fast decisions.
"
22716,"Where will we have it?
"
22717,"- Here. What time?
"
22718,"- 4:00. Food?
"
22719,"- Finger sandwiches and tea.
"
22720,"- Great! Very Monica.
"
22721,"- And chili!
"
22722,"- You went one too far.
"
22723,"- Flowers or balloons?
"
22724,"- Both.
"
22725,"- We're paying for this.
"
22726,"- Neither.
"
22727,"- What should we do for a theme?
"
22728,"- Lusts of the Flesh!
"
22729,"- What?
"
22730,"- I don't know. Cowboy theme?
"
22731,"I'm glad we decided not to sleep
"
22732,"together before the wedding.
"
22733,"Oh, boy. Me too.
"
22734,"I was thinking, say we had a big fight,
"
22735,"and broke up for a few hours.
"
22736,"Technically, we could have sex again.
"
22737,"What do you think,
"
22738,"bossy and domineering?
"
22739,"The wedding's off,
"
22740,"sloppy and immature.
"
22741,"That's me. Come on.
"
22742,"Wait. Cassie's in the guest room.
"
22743,"We're going to lunch.
"
22744,"Get rid of her, obsessive and shrill!
"
22745,"Shrill? The wedding is back on.
"
22746,"I thought I heard voices.
"
22747,"You must be Chandler.
"
22748,"- Hi. Nice to meet you.
"
22749,"- Nice to meet you too.
"
22750,"- So, ready to go?
"
22751,"- Yeah.
"
22752,"- Chandler?
"
22753,"- I'll be right with you.
"
22754,"- Cassie needs to stay at your place.
"
22755,"- Why?
"
22756,"Because ""Pervie Perverson"" here
"
22757,"can't stop staring at her.
"
22758,"Chandler, she's our cousin!
"
22759,"I wasn't staring.
"
22760,"I was listening intently.
"
22761,"It's called being a good
"
22762,"conversationalist. Watch.
"
22763,"Say something.
"
22764,"You were staring about eight inches
"
22765,"south of there.
"
22766,"Fine. She can stay at my place.
"
22767,"What does Cassie look like now?
"
22768,"Exactly like Aunt Marilyn.
"
22769,"This Aunt Marilyn,
"
22770,"is she coming to the wedding?
"
22771,"Wafer-thin ice.
"
22772,"Hey, I'm back.
"
22773,"Hi, Joey.
"
22774,"Will I read the same scene again?
"
22775,"I tried to call you.
"
22776,"You didn't need to come today.
"
22777,"Oh, great.
"
22778,"I'd have been perfect for this part.
"
22779,"You made a bad decision and
"
22780,"ruined your movie. Good day!
"
22781,"You didn't need to come, because the
"
22782,"director saw your tape and loved it.
"
22783,"End scene.
"
22784,"Wasn't that fun? We did
"
22785,"a little improv there. Yeah!
"
22786,"So, you were saying?
"
22787,"The director wants to meet you
"
22788,"tomorrow.
"
22789,"Wow! Sure! That's great.
"
22790,"Your agent said you're okay
"
22791,"with nudity.
"
22792,"Yeah, sure. As long as
"
22793,"it's handled tastefully.
"
22794,"And that barn is not too cold.
"
22795,"Perfect. There's one more thing.
"
22796,"It's important to the director that
"
22797,"everything in the movie's authentic.
"
22798,"In your love scene with Sarah...
"
22799,"...she talks about how she's never
"
22800,"seen a naked man who wasn't Jewish.
"
22801,"So... .
"
22802,"So... what?
"
22803,"So, the director is insisting
"
22804,"that whoever play that part...
"
22805,"...be authentically, anatomically...
"
22806,"...not Jewish.
"
22807,"You know what I'm saying?
"
22808,"Yes!
"
22809,"No. What?
"
22810,"An Italian Catholic immigrant
"
22811,"at this time would not be... .
"
22812,"Bar mitzvah-ed?
"
22813,"- To get this part, you can't be...
"
22814,"- No.
"
22815,"But you are?
"
22816,"- You told them you weren't?
"
22817,"- That's right.
"
22818,"Wow!
"
22819,"It's definitely all gone?
"
22820,"There's nothing there to work with?
"
22821,"- What were you thinking?
"
22822,"- I don't know. I just want this part.
"
22823,"They say no matter what you're asked
"
22824,"during an audition, say yes.
"
22825,"They want you to ride a horse,
"
22826,"say you can.
"
22827,"You figure out how to do it later.
"
22828,"This is not like learning to ride
"
22829,"a horse. This is like learning to...
"
22830,"...grow a turtleneck.
"
22831,"I know, okay? Tomorrow,
"
22832,"when I go meet the director...
"
22833,"...I have to take my clothes off so
"
22834,"they can see what my body looks like.
"
22835,"Oh, my God. What are you gonna do?
"
22836,"I have to call my agent and
"
22837,"tell her I can't do the part.
"
22838,"Unless... .
"
22839,"Unless what?
"
22840,"This may sound crazy, but there may
"
22841,"be something we could...
"
22842,"...fashion.
"
22843,"- Like what?
"
22844,"- Well, I'm not sure yet.
"
22845,"Off the top of my head,
"
22846,"I'm thinking...
"
22847,"...double-sided tape
"
22848,"and some sort of luncheon meat.
"
22849,"I've got a great idea for party
"
22850,"favors for the shower.
"
22851,"We get mahogany boxes and
"
22852,"carve everyone's names in them.
"
22853,"Then inside is each person's
"
22854,"individual birthstone.
"
22855,"Okay. Okay.
"
22856,"You take care of that.
"
22857,"Meanwhile, the party's tomorrow
"
22858,"and we don't have a guest list.
"
22859,"Okay. Who do we know that's coming?
"
22860,"Me. Are you?
"
22861,"- Hey.
"
22862,"- Hey, what's up?
"
22863,"I'm making something for Joey.
"
22864,"Can I raid your fridge?
"
22865,"Have at it.
"
22866,"All right. Turkey? That won't work.
"
22867,"Cheese? That won't work.
"
22868,"Olive loaf? I hope that won't work.
"
22869,"Are you making him a sandwich?
"
22870,"No, it's more like a wrap.
"
22871,"Okay, so I'm gonna go, guys.
"
22872,"So you can get back to deciding on
"
22873,"what to get me for a present!
"
22874,"We have to get her a present?
"
22875,"Okay, but look. Look at what I got.
"
22876,"It's her address book.
"
22877,"We have a guest list.
"
22878,"You're amazing. Did you pull
"
22879,"that out of her purse?
"
22880,"Uh-huh. And a little seed money
"
22881,"for the party.
"
22882,"Cassie?
"
22883,"Hey, Ross!
"
22884,"It's been so long!
"
22885,"Last time I saw you...
"
22886,"...you were setting up your tent
"
22887,"in line for Return of the Jedi. 
"
22888,"So you did see me that day.
"
22889,"Because it seemed like you didn't.
"
22890,"- Yeah, sorry about that.
"
22891,"- It's okay. Come on in.
"
22892,"Thanks for letting me stay here.
"
22893,"Monica's place was nice.
"
22894,"But her fiancï¿½ sure stares a lot.
"
22895,"Oh, my God! You do a great Chandler!
"
22896,"I have a knack for impressions.
"
22897,"Maybe after we get re-acquainted
"
22898,"you could do me.
"
22899,"Yeah. No!
"
22900,"How you doing on that...
"
22901,"...hot dog?
"
22902,"- I'm all done.
"
22903,"- Thank God.
"
22904,"The last time we hung out was when
"
22905,"our parents rented that beach house.
"
22906,"Remember the time I pinned you down
"
22907,"and tickled you until you cried?
"
22908,"We're probably too old to do that now.
"
22909,"I'll always remember that summer.
"
22910,"It's when I got all these freckles.
"
22911,"I'll always remember that summer...
"
22912,"...because that's when I realized
"
22913,"that we are related.
"
22914,"It took you that long
"
22915,"to figure it out?
"
22916,"I'm a little slow.
"
22917,"Just as our children would be.
"
22918,"- Hi.
"
22919,"- Hi.
"
22920,"How are you? Good. Hi.
"
22921,"Thanks for coming.
"
22922,"Thank you. So nice to see you.
"
22923,"- No, thanks.
"
22924,"- Okay. Hey, Rach?
"
22925,"- Yeah?
"
22926,"- Who the hell are all these people?
"
22927,"I don't know.
"
22928,"I called everybody in her book.
"
22929,"These are the ones that could
"
22930,"show up on 24 hours' notice.
"
22931,"There's a word for people like that:
"
22932,"Losers.
"
22933,"Hi, I'm Rachel. This is Phoebe.
"
22934,"I'm the maid of honor.
"
22935,"- How do you know Monica?
"
22936,"- I was her accountant four years ago.
"
22937,"I'm interested to find out who's been
"
22938,"doing her taxes the last four years.
"
22939,"That's great.
"
22940,"- When is Monica supposed to get here?
"
22941,"- I don't know.
"
22942,"Excuse us.
"
22943,"- You didn't tell her?
"
22944,"- You were supposed to.
"
22945,"You were supposed to tell her to come!
"
22946,"I was bringing the cake!
"
22947,"- Fine, I'll go call her.
"
22948,"- And please tell her to bring a cake!
"
22949,"We have a lot of options. A number
"
22950,"of prototypes for you to try on.
"
22951,"Those look great.
"
22952,"Okay, this one's a mushroom cap.
"
22953,"This one is made of bologna.
"
22954,"- The toothpicks?
"
22955,"- Just until the glue dries.
"
22956,"Thank God.
"
22957,"These are more realistic,
"
22958,"but perishable.
"
22959,"Over here, we have pink suede,
"
22960,"which is nice.
"
22961,"But if it gets wet, it'll shrink.
"
22962,"Maybe we'll just
"
22963,"take that one away.
"
22964,"I also did a little something in fur,
"
22965,"but that's really just for me.
"
22966,"Why don't you try these on? We'll
"
22967,"get a better idea of what works.
"
22968,"Thanks, you are such a good friend.
"
22969,"And this is so weird.
"
22970,"- Toothpick?
"
22971,"- Yeah.
"
22972,"- What are you trying now?
"
22973,"- The Fruit Roll-up.
"
22974,"- And?
"
22975,"- Delicious.
"
22976,"Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
"
22977,"We have a winner!
"
22978,"What? Which one?
"
22979,"The Silly Putty.
"
22980,"Not so silly anymore!
"
22981,"She's your cousin. 
"
22982,"She's your cousin. 
"
22983,"If she knew what was going on in
"
22984,"your head, she'd think you were sick. 
"
22985,"Or would she? 
"
22986,"Let's back up for a second. 
"
22987,"She was the one who suggested
"
22988,"opening a bottle of wine. 
"
22989,"She was the one who
"
22990,"turned down the lights. 
"
22991,"She was the one that wanted to rent
"
22992,"Logan's Run...
"
22993,"... the sexiest movie ever. 
"
22994,"I know that look. 
"
22995,"Forget it. I want it. She wants it. 
"
22996,"I'm going in. 
"
22997,"What the hell are you doing?
"
22998,"Say something clever. 
"
22999,"Okay, doesn't have to be clever. 
"
23000,"Just has to be words. Say some words. 
"
23001,"Any words will do. 
"
23002,"Oh, my God, this is the longest... 
"
23003,"... that anyone has not talked ever! 
"
23004,"There is nothing you could say
"
23005,"to make this worse... 
"
23006,"... so just say something! 
"
23007,"I haven't had sex in a very long time.
"
23008,"Yeah, you really shouldn't
"
23009,"have said anything. 
"
23010,"Phoebe? Rachel? It's Monica.
"
23011,"I wonder what you could possibly
"
23012,"need me for on such short notice?
"
23013,"- Oh, Monica. We are so sorry.
"
23014,"- For what?
"
23015,"First, for forgetting to
"
23016,"throw you a bridal shower.
"
23017,"Then, forgetting to invite you to it.
"
23018,"You already had it?
"
23019,"We called everyone in your phone book.
"
23020,"A bunch of people came.
"
23021,"It took us so long to get you here
"
23022,"that they had to leave.
"
23023,"We wanted to throw you a big surprise
"
23024,"and a great shower.
"
23025,"Now you don't have either.
"
23026,"We ruined everything.
"
23027,"No, wait a minute, that's not true.
"
23028,"What you did was really sweet.
"
23029,"- It kind of works out for the best.
"
23030,"- What do you mean?
"
23031,"Now I get to spend my shower
"
23032,"with the only people I really love.
"
23033,"I get all those presents without
"
23034,"talking to people I don't even like!
"
23035,"- Surprise.
"
23036,"- Surprise, Monica.
"
23037,"What's cool is, the character
"
23038,"is from Naples, right?
"
23039,"My whole family's from Naples.
"
23040,"That's great. Okay. I've heard
"
23041,"everything I need to hear... .
"
23042,"We just need to, uh... .
"
23043,"Leslie?
"
23044,"- Joey, this is the awkward part.
"
23045,"- Hey, right. Not a problem.
"
23046,"I totally understand you need to...
"
23047,"...make sure I don't have any
"
23048,"horrible scars or tattoos.
"
23049,"Don't you worry.
"
23050,"I have nothing to hide.
"
23051,"So, there you go. That's me.
"
23052,"One hundred-percent natural.
"
23053,"I tell you, that has never
"
23054,"happened before.
"
23055,"Cassie, are you finding
"
23056,"everything okay?
"
23057,"Yeah. Thanks for
"
23058,"letting me stay here.
"
23059,"Oh, it's no problem.
"
23060,"What?
"
23061,"Say something. Say anything. 
"
23062,"Ask her out! She's not your cousin!

"
23064,"Out of all of us, who do you think
"
23065,"will get married next?
"
23066,"Probably Monica and Chandler.
"
23067,"Could I have a pack of Newport Lights?
"
23068,"We don't sell cigarettes,
"
23069,"but they do across the street.
"
23070,"That'd be great. Thanks.
"
23071,"Melissa Worbert. I don't think
"
23072,"I have the energy for this.
"
23073,"Oh, my God! Ray-Ray Greene?
"
23074,"You've been MIA
"
23075,"for seven sorority newsletters.
"
23076,"What's up with you?
"
23077,"Why don't I tell you over here?
"
23078,"So last I heard
"
23079,"you were gonna get married.
"
23080,"Poor Ray-Ray.
"
23081,"Oh, no. It's all good.
"
23082,"- I actually work at Ralph Lauren.
"
23083,"- Shut up!
"
23084,"I will not. I'm the divisional head
"
23085,"of men's sportswear.
"
23086,"Shut up more!
"
23087,"Are you friends with Ralph?
"
23088,"- Oh, please.
"
23089,"- Are you?
"
23090,"No.
"
23091,"We have to have dinner.
"
23092,"What are you doing tomorrow?
"
23093,"- Tomorrow. I don't know.
"
23094,"- You're having dinner with me.
"
23095,"Shut up.
"
23096,"I've gotta go.
"
23097,"This has been so great.
"
23098,"Oh, there you are.
"
23099,"So listen, just call me.
"
23100,"Here's my card.
"
23101,"- You're in real estate?
"
23102,"- No, that's an old card.
"
23103,"I got out of that to do something
"
23104,"where I could...
"
23105,"...help people and make a difference.
"
23106,"What do you do now?
"
23107,"I'm a party planner.
"
23108,"- I'll see you tomorrow.
"
23109,"- Okay.
"
23110,"Look who's back. It's Ray-Ray.
"
23111,"That was my friend, Melissa,
"
23112,"from college.
"
23113,"She seems really, really fun!
"
23114,"She's actually sweet,
"
23115,"and we used to be very close.
"
23116,"Wait a minute.
"
23117,"She's not the one who you...?
"
23118,"Who you what? Who you what?
"
23119,"- Yes.
"
23120,"- Wow!
"
23121,"Wow, what? Who you what?
"
23122,"Oh, it's not a big deal.
"
23123,"They were lovers.
"
23124,"- What?
"
23125,"- What?
"
23126,"No, we weren't. It was nothing.
"
23127,"It was one night, senior year,
"
23128,"and we went to a party...
"
23129,"...had a lot of sangria,
"
23130,"and you know, ended up...
"
23131,"...kissing for a bit.
"
23132,"So that's two of my wives.

"
23136,"So this is where the band is.
"
23137,"And here's the bar.
"
23138,"And all these pins have people's names
"
23139,"on them. Rach, here you are.
"
23140,"Why don't we just put me
"
23141,"with a Manhattan in my hand...
"
23142,"...talking to the cute bartender.
"
23143,"These pins aren't for playing,
"
23144,"are they?
"
23145,"The red are my guests,
"
23146,"and the blue are yours.
"
23147,"This is so sad.
"
23148,"I only have like 10 pins.
"
23149,"Chandler, relax. It's not a contest.
"
23150,"Certainly not a close one.
"
23151,"Hey, Rach.
"
23152,"Stop picturing it!
"
23153,"I think that's it. The seating chart
"
23154,"is done. This is our wedding.
"
23155,"They all look like they're having fun.
"
23156,"So where are my parents gonna be?
"
23157,"Well, if this is the wedding hall...
"
23158,"...your parents would be over here
"
23159,"at home in Queens.
"
23160,"They're not invited?
"
23161,"Oh, no, they're gonna be crushed!
"
23162,"Why would they think they're invited?
"
23163,"You got me. I don't... .
"
23164,"- Joey!
"
23165,"- Look, I thought parents were coming.
"
23166,"Your parents are coming.
"
23167,"Chandler's are coming.
"
23168,"Ross' parents are coming.
"
23169,"Ross' parents are my parents.
"
23170,"Well, see, parents are coming.
"
23171,"- We should invite them.
"
23172,"- You just want more blue pins.
"
23173,"Well, this is just sad.
"
23174,"All right. Maybe I can fit them in
"
23175,"if I just do some rearranging.
"
23176,"Rachel may have to sit at the bar.
"
23177,"That is not a problem.
"
23178,"- Maybe you'll order a little sangria.
"
23179,"- Get out of here!
"
23180,"These are our tuxedos. If you like
"
23181,"anything, we can make a deal.
"
23182,"Anything at all. But these are
"
23183,"the three that Monica pre-approved.
"
23184,"Thanks a lot for hooking me up.
"
23185,"And I want you to know that I want
"
23186,"you to attend our wedding as my guest.
"
23187,"I'm Monica's maid of honor.
"
23188,"Okay, don't try to blue-pin me.
"
23189,"- Well, these look nice.
"
23190,"- They are nice.
"
23191,"When celebrities are done with them,
"
23192,"they send them back.
"
23193,"- You mean like for award shows?
"
23194,"- Some of them.
"
23195,"They've been down the red carpet
"
23196,"with people yelling...
"
23197,"...""Who are you wearing?
"
23198,"You look fabulous! ""
"
23199,"Might I suggest watching
"
23200,"a little more ESPN...
"
23201,"...and a little less E! .
"
23202,"Okay. Who wore those?
"
23203,"- Well, this one's Tom Brokaw.
"
23204,"- Not bad.
"
23205,"This one is Paul O'Neil.
"
23206,"Who's that?
"
23207,"He plays for the Yankees.
"
23208,"Seriously, ESPN.
"
23209,"Just once in a while.
"
23210,"Have it on in the background.
"
23211,"- This one was Pierce Brosnan.
"
23212,"- Pierce Brosnan?
"
23213,"Are you serious?
"
23214,"007?
"
23215,"This is James Bond's tux? I have to
"
23216,"get married in James Bond's tux.
"
23217,"It's a pretty cool tux.
"
23218,"It's not just that. I would be
"
23219,"England's most powerful weapon.
"
23220,"A jet-setting heartbreaker
"
23221,"on Her Majesty's secret service.
"
23222,"A man who fears no one,
"
23223,"with a license to kill.
"
23224,"Would Monica let me wear this?
"
23225,"We should really learn
"
23226,"how to play the real way.
"
23227,"I like our way.
"
23228,"Chess!
"
23229,"- Nice move.
"
23230,"- Yeah.
"
23231,"I hooked Ross and Chandler up
"
23232,"with tuxedos. Do you need one?
"
23233,"No, I'm not wearing a tux.
"
23234,"- What are you gonna wear?
"
23235,"- Multi-colored robes.
"
23236,"And maybe a hat.
"
23237,"- Does Monica know about this?
"
23238,"- No.
"
23239,"Can I please be there
"
23240,"when you tell her?
"
23241,"You want to go to a movie tonight?
"
23242,"I'm having dinner with Melissa.
"
23243,"Can I come?
"
23244,"I won't talk.
"
23245,"You'll just hear my video camera.
"
23246,"- What? What's going on?
"
23247,"- Can I tell her?
"
23248,"Do you want what happened,
"
23249,"or Joey's lewd version?
"
23250,"Joey's.
"
23251,"I had this college friend...
"
23252,"...and I made the mistake
"
23253,"of telling Joey that one time...
"
23254,"...she and l, you know,
"
23255,"kissed a little bit.
"
23256,"Yeah, I'm sure that happened.
"
23257,"- It did.
"
23258,"- Sure.
"
23259,"Hey. It happened.
"
23260,"It was senior year.
"
23261,"It was after the Sigma Chi luau...
"
23262,"...and Melissa and I got very drunk.
"
23263,"And we ended up kissing.
"
23264,"For several minutes.
"
23265,"Which means she had a couple spritzers
"
23266,"and a peck on the cheek.
"
23267,"Why are you taking this away from me?
"
23268,"Why is it so hard for you to believe?
"
23269,"Okay. I just didn't know
"
23270,"that you were a lesbian.
"
23271,"I'm not saying that I'm a lesbian.
"
23272,"I'm just saying that this happened.
"
23273,"It just seems pretty wild.
"
23274,"And you're so...
"
23275,"...vanilla.
"
23276,"Vanilla? I'm not vanilla.
"
23277,"I do lots of crazy things.
"
23278,"I mean, I got drunk
"
23279,"and married in Vegas.
"
23280,"To Ross.
"
23281,"If you don't believe me...
"
23282,"...just come with me to dinner tonight
"
23283,"and she'll tell you.
"
23284,"Okay. Because I can't picture it.
"
23285,"You should get inside my head.
"
23286,"Guess what I got for your wedding?
"
23287,"A freakishly thin date
"
23288,"with a hanger for a head?
"
23289,"Rachel hooked me up with a tux.
"
23290,"But not just any tux.
"
23291,"Batman's tux!
"
23292,"- What?
"
23293,"- That's right.
"
23294,"Made expressly for Val Kilmer,
"
23295,"and worn by him in the hit film...
"
23296,"...that Batman film he was in.
"
23297,"You can't wear that.
"
23298,"I'm wearing the famous tux.
"
23299,"If you wear that,
"
23300,"it'll make mine less special.
"
23301,"You need something to
"
23302,"to make it special?
"
23303,"You have
"
23304,"the most special thing of all.
"
23305,"You are marrying the woman you love.
"
23306,"Don't take away my cool thing.
"
23307,"Pretty please?
"
23308,"""Pretty please?"" Not very 007.
"
23309,"If you were getting married,
"
23310,"I'd never do anything to upset you.
"
23311,"- You slept with my sister.
"
23312,"- That was pretty 007.
"
23313,"All right, I figured it out.
"
23314,"I'm gonna take 2 tables of 8,
"
23315,"add your parents...
"
23316,"...and make them into 3 tables of 6.
"
23317,"And I called the caterer.
"
23318,"We are good to go!
"
23319,"Yeah. They're not coming.
"
23320,"What?
"
23321,"They think that you only
"
23322,"invited them because of me.
"
23323,"They feel unwanted.
"
23324,"That's too bad.
"
23325,"It's true. But too bad.
"
23326,"If you could just call my mom.
"
23327,"Just let her know
"
23328,"you want them there.
"
23329,"This is a woman
"
23330,"who has sent you many lasagnas.
"
23331,"No, she hasn't.
"
23332,"Is it her fault
"
23333,"if some didn't make it to you?
"
23334,"What am I gonna say?
"
23335,"Tell them you mixed up invitations.
"
23336,"No, blame it on the post office.
"
23337,"They hate the post office.
"
23338,"And the Irish.
"
23339,"But I don't think
"
23340,"you could blame it on them.
"
23341,"Hello? Yeah, hi. Mrs. Tribbianni?
"
23342,"This is Monica Geller.
"
23343,"I'm just calling to say that I really
"
23344,"hope you can make the wedding.
"
23345,"Apparently some of our invitations
"
23346,"weren't delivered.
"
23347,"I guess there was some screw-up
"
23348,"at the damn post office.
"
23349,"Tell me about it!
"
23350,"Yeah, the U.S. Post Office?
"
23351,"No. More like U.S. Lost Office.
"
23352,"What are they, Irish?
"
23353,"Anyway, his name's Allen. And we've
"
23354,"been going out for three years.
"
23355,"He was my first client
"
23356,"when I became a party planner.
"
23357,"He was actually planning a party
"
23358,"for his girlfriend at the time.
"
23359,"Oh, well.
"
23360,"- He was Theta Beta Pi at Syracuse.
"
23361,"- That's great.
"
23362,"- Were you ever in a sorority?
"
23363,"- Of course.
"
23364,"Yes. I was a Thigh Mega Tampon.
"
23365,"What one?
"
23366,"We were huge too.
"
23367,"But they had to shut us down...
"
23368,"...when Regina Phalangie
"
23369,"died of alcohol poisoning.
"
23370,"Isn't it a shame when one girl
"
23371,"ruins it for the whole bunch?
"
23372,"Anyway... .
"
23373,"Speaking of drinking too much,
"
23374,"I told Phoebe...
"
23375,"...about that crazy night after the
"
23376,"Sigma Chi luau where we made out.
"
23377,"What?
"
23378,"Remember we... Come on, we had sarongs
"
23379,"on and the coconut bikini tops.
"
23380,"We went back to the house
"
23381,"and got really silly...
"
23382,"...and we made out.
"
23383,"Wow, Ray-Ray, I have no idea
"
23384,"what you're talking about.
"
23385,"Really?
"
23386,"Ross is Batman.
"
23387,"Well, he did manage to keep
"
23388,"his identity secret for a long time.
"
23389,"Rachel got Ross the tuxedo
"
23390,"that Val Kilmer wore in Batman.
"
23391,"Batman is so much cooler
"
23392,"than James Bond.
"
23393,"- What? 007 has all those gadgets.
"
23394,"- Batman has a utility belt.
"
23395,"- 007 has a fancy car.
"
23396,"- Batman has the Batmobile.
"
23397,"- 007 gets all the ladies.
"
23398,"- Batman has Robin.
"
23399,"We get ESPN, right?
"
23400,"How about you go put on your 007
"
23401,"tuxedo, and I'll make you a martini?
"
23402,"I don't like martinis.
"
23403,"- A Yoo-Hoo with a funny straw?
"
23404,"- Yum.
"
23405,"I know the invitation says 6 p.m.
"
23406,"But does that mean get there at 6,
"
23407,"or the show starts at 6?
"
23408,"The show?
"
23409,"Right, the wedding. Gotcha.
"
23410,"But weddings start
"
23411,"a little late, right?
"
23412,"Have you ever
"
23413,"been to one of my weddings?
"
23414,"Well, it's the same day
"
23415,"as my niece's christening...
"
23416,"...and I want my parents to see me.
"
23417,"My part's in the beginning. I'm not
"
23418,"in the rest of the show... Wedding.
"
23419,"The wedding starts at 6.
"
23420,"Okay. I totally hear you.
"
23421,"How about this?
"
23422,"I vamp till they get there.
"
23423,"You'll ""vamp""?
"
23424,"Like warm up the crowd.
"
23425,"Ask where they're from.
"
23426,"In Joey Tribbianni, you get
"
23427,"a minister and an entertainer.
"
23428,"I'm a ""ministainer.""
"
23429,"There's no one better.
"
23430,"There's no one greater.
"
23431,"How can you not remember us kissing?
"
23432,"I don't know. I don't remember
"
23433,"a lot of things that never happened.
"
23434,"Remember, we were on the sleeping
"
23435,"porch? We couldn't stop giggling.
"
23436,"Our coconuts kept knocking together.
"
23437,"Somewhere Joey's head is exploding.
"
23438,"I don't want
"
23439,"to make you uncomfortable...
"
23440,"...but I told Phoebe it happened,
"
23441,"and she doesn't believe me.
"
23442,"I'm sorry. I mean, if I thought
"
23443,"it happened, I would say it.
"
23444,"Maybe I passed out and you did stuff
"
23445,"to me while I was sleeping.
"
23446,"It's okay, you don't have to do this.
"
23447,"I believe you.
"
23448,"If you say you kissed Melissa,
"
23449,"then you kissed Melissa.
"
23450,"- Thank you, Phoebe.
"
23451,"- Okay.
"
23452,"- But she didn't.
"
23453,"- I know.
"
23454,"You carry that around?
"
23455,"I find it to be something
"
23456,"of a conversation piece.
"
23457,"- Between you and...?
"
23458,"- Gunther.
"
23459,"Why don't we put them on?
"
23460,"Get a picture of Batman
"
23461,"and James Bond, together.
"
23462,"I would, but my pants
"
23463,"are a little tight.
"
23464,"A little tight?
"
23465,"I could see 00 and 7 in those things.
"
23466,"I was looking forward to wearing
"
23467,"our celebrity tuxes together.
"
23468,"- So you're not gonna be wearing yours?
"
23469,"- Are you kidding? It's Batman's tux!
"
23470,"Let me try it on.
"
23471,"Okay. But just the jacket.
"
23472,"00 and 7 are not getting in there.
"
23473,"Holy double-vented comfort, Batman!
"
23474,"What's this?
"
23475,"An invitation to
"
23476,"the At First Sight premiere?
"
23477,"Val Kilmer didn't
"
23478,"wear this in Batman. 
"
23479,"He wore it to the premiere of a fruity
"
23480,"love story where he was a blind guy.
"
23481,"Let me see that.
"
23482,"Oh, man.
"
23483,"The only super power you have is the
"
23484,"slightly heightened sense of smell.
"
23485,"Can I talk to you guys for a second?
"
23486,"I give up.
"
23487,"Whatever you want, you can have it.
"
23488,"You want to sing a song or do a dance?
"
23489,"You want your mom at the altar
"
23490,"screaming racial slurs? I don't care.
"
23491,"I just want to thank you guys
"
23492,"for what you did for my parents.
"
23493,"They're so happy
"
23494,"to be a part of your special day.
"
23495,"Tell them we're glad they're coming.
"
23496,"I will. Oh, check out what they got
"
23497,"me to wear for the ceremony!
"
23498,"I wear it like this when I
"
23499,"marry you guys. And then this...
"
23500,"...is for party time.
"
23501,"It happened.
"
23502,"I am telling you it happened.
"
23503,"It was great meeting you.
"
23504,"And, Rachel? I don't think
"
23505,"I'll be calling you because...
"
23506,"...you know, you've gotten weird.
"
23507,"Take care, you guys.
"
23508,"Wait a minute. Okay, look.
"
23509,"That night was the one wild thing
"
23510,"I've ever done in my life.
"
23511,"I won't let you take it away.
"
23512,"So if you don't remember that,
"
23513,"maybe you'll remember this... .
"
23514,"Oh, my God. You love me.
"
23515,"What?
"
23516,"Of course I remember.
"
23517,"I think about it all the time.
"
23518,"I can still hear
"
23519,"the coconuts knocking together... .
"
23520,"I didn't want to tell you, because I
"
23521,"didn't think you'd return my love... .
"
23522,"Look who's being suddenly shy.
"
23523,"You have to feel what I feel.
"
23524,"Nobody can kiss that good
"
23525,"and not mean it.
"
23526,"I'm just a good kisser.
"
23527,"Shut up.
"
23528,"I'm sorry.
"
23529,"You don't have to be sorry.
"
23530,"I'm obviously kidding.
"
23531,"I'm not in love with you.
"
23532,"I'm not in love with her.
"
23533,"I don't hear coconuts
"
23534,"banging together.
"
23535,"I don't picture your face
"
23536,"when I make love to my boyfriend.
"
23537,"Anyway, I gotta go.
"
23538,"A kiss goodbye?
"
23539,"No? Okay.
"
23540,"I mean, I had no idea
"
23541,"that that would... .
"
23542,"What the hell was that?
"
23543,"Just wanted to see
"
23544,"what all the fuss was about.
"
23545,"- And?
"
23546,"- I've had better.
"
23547,"I found one that fits.
"
23548,"Well, you know what they say?
"
23549,"23rd time's a charm.
"
23550,"Look at you, all handsome.
"
23551,"- Whose is it?
"
23552,"- Does it matter?
"
23553,"All that matters
"
23554,"is that you look so handsome.
"
23555,"- Whose is it?
"
23556,"- I don't want to say.
"
23557,"Come on, I don't care. Whose is it?

"
23584,"There are no words!
"
23585,"This shouldn't be this hard!
"
23586,"You've done this before.
"
23587,"What did you say in your vows?
"
23588,"With Carol I promised never
"
23589,"to love another woman until I die.
"
23590,"She made no such promise.
"

"
23594,"You have to help me write my vows.

"
23614,"we were friends...
"
23615,"...there was a part of me
"
23616,"that knew I wanted more. ""

"
23618,"holocaust. I'm the last man on Earth.
"
23619,"Would you go out with me?
"
23620,"Are we allowed to lie in the vows?
"
23621,"Okay, don't talk about those feelings.
"
23622,"Just say something about...
"
23623,"...all the things
"
23624,"he's taught you, like...
"
23625,"Or all the things you taught him.
"
23626,"Everybody knows the erogenous zones.
"
23627,"One, two, three...
"
23628,"...four, five, six and seven.
"
23629,"There are seven?
"
23630,"- That's one?
"
23631,"- Kind of an important one.
"
23632,"I was looking at it upside down.
"
23633,"You know, sometimes that helps.
"
23634,"Okay, start out with a little one...
"

"
23637,"...a four, a three-two...

"
23647,"over our time together... . ""
"
23648,"- Yeah?
"
23649,"- I can't do all of it.

"

23655,"- Yeah, when?
"
23656,"When we're 40,
"
23657,"if neither of us are married...
"
23658,"...what do you say we have one?
"
23659,"- Why wouldn't I be married?
"
23660,"I just meant hypothetically.
"
23661,"Hypothetically,
"
23662,"why won't I be married?
"
23663,"No, no.
"
23664,"What is it? Is there
"
23665,"something unmarriable about me?
"
23666,"Well?
"
23667,"Dear God, this parachute
"
23668,"is a knapsack!
"
23669,"I'm getting married today!
"

"
23671,"Nice try.
"
23672,"Wait, wait, wait.
"
23673,"Look, Monica...
"
23674,"- This is not gonna work.
"
23675,"- I bet this'll work.
"
23676,"You are so great! I love you.
"
23677,"What?
"
23678,"I said you're so great,
"
23679,"and then I stopped talking.
"
23680,"- You said you love me!
"
23681,"- No, I didn't.
"
23682,"- Yes, you did.
"
23683,"- No, I didn't!
"
23684,"- You love me!
"
23685,"- No, I don't!
"
23686,"Stop it! Stop it!
"
23687,"You know, I was thinking,
"
23688,"what if I unpack here?
"
23689,"Then all your stuff would be here.
"
23690,"Well... .
"
23691,"What if it was here?
"
23692,"Then you'd be going back
"
23693,"and forth all the time.
"
23694,"Doesn't make any sense.
"
23695,"Okay.
"
23696,"What if we live together,
"
23697,"and you understand what I'm saying?
"
23698,"We wanted to surprise you.
"
23699,"Oh, my God!
"
23700,"Chandler...
"
23701,"...in all my life...
"
23702,"...I never thought I'd be so lucky...
"
23703,"...as to fall in love with my best...
"
23704,"My best... There's a reason
"
23705,"why girls don't do this!
"
23706,"Okay, okay, okay! I'll do it.
"
23707,"I thought...
"
23708,"I can do this.
"
23709,"I thought...
"
23710,"...that it mattered what I said
"
23711,"or where I said it.
"
23712,"Then I realized the only thing
"
23713,"that matters is that you...
"
23714,"You make me happier
"
23715,"than I ever thought I could be.
"
23716,"And if you let me...
"
23717,"...I'll spend the rest of my life
"
23718,"trying to make you feel the same way.
"
23719,"Monica?
"
23720,"Will you marry me?
"
23721,"Yes.
"
23722,"Can we come in?
"
23723,"We're dying out here!
"
23724,"Come in! Come in!
"
23725,"- We're engaged!
"
23726,"- Yes!
"
23727,"- Hi.
"
23728,"- What have you guys been up to?
"
23729,"Helping Chandler write his vows.
"
23730,"He kicked us out.
"
23731,"Joey kept making
"
23732,"inappropriate suggestions.
"
23733,"How is ""Monica, I love
"
23734,"your sweet ass"" inappropriate?
"
23735,"How's Monica doing?
"
23736,"Lucky she's got a sweet ass.
"
23737,"She's not so good at writing.
"
23738,"In four weeks
"
23739,"they're gonna be married!
"
23740,"Let's just hope it works.
"
23741,"Nine out of 10 marriages
"
23742,"end in divorce.
"
23743,"That's not true.
"
23744,"You're right. How's the missis?
"
23745,"I can't believe...
"
23746,"...they're together 3 years.
"
23747,"- That long?
"
23748,"It seems like less
"
23749,"because they hid it from us.
"
23750,"Hey, it's me. Coming in.
"
23751,"I've had a very long, hard day.
"
23752,"- I'm getting some chicken. Want some?
"
23753,"- No. Bye, then.
"
23754,"He wouldn't leave.
"
23755,"He kept asking if I wanted chicken.
"
23756,"Chicken?
"
23757,"I could eat some chicken.
"
23758,"Hey, Joe!
"
23759,"Can I get a three-piece,
"
23760,"coleslaw, beans and a Coke?
"
23761,"Diet Coke.
"
23762,"- Why didn't they tell us?
"
23763,"- I know, we were cool about it.
"
23764,"You? And you?
"
23765,"You cannot tell. No one knows.
"
23766,"How? When?
"
23767,"- It happened in London.
"
23768,"- In London?!
"
23769,"We didn't want to make
"
23770,"a big deal out of it.
"
23771,"But it is a big deal!
"
23772,"- I have to tell someone.
"
23773,"- No, no!
"
23774,"- You can't.
"
23775,"- Please!
"
23776,"We don't want to deal with telling
"
23777,"them. Just promise you won't tell.
"
23778,"All right!
"
23779,"I can 't wait to be with you. 
"
23780,"I'll tell Rachel I'm doing laundry. 
"
23781,"Laundry? Is that my new nickname? 
"
23782,"You know your nickname, Mr. Big... 
"
23783,"Oh, look, there's Monica and Chandler.
"
23784,"Hey! Hey, you guys! Hey!
"
23785,"Chandler and Monica!
"
23786,"Oh, my God!
"
23787,"- Chandler and Monica!
"
23788,"- Oh, my God!
"
23789,"- Oh, my eyes! My eyes!
"
23790,"- Phoebe! Phoebe!
"
23791,"- It's okay! It's okay!
"
23792,"- No! They're doing it!
"
23793,"I know! I know!
"
23794,"- You know?
"
23795,"- Yes!
"
23796,"And Joey, but Ross doesn't,
"
23797,"so stop screaming!
"
23798,"- Hey, what's going on?
"
23799,"- Oh, hi!
"
23800,"What? What?
"
23801,"We're excited that you
"
23802,"might get this place!
"
23803,"- Actually, it looks really good.
"
23804,"- It looks pretty good!
"
23805,"Get in here! Come on!
"
23806,"So they don't know
"
23807,"that Rachel knows?
"
23808,"Yes, but it doesn't matter
"
23809,"who knows what.
"
23810,"Enough of us know.
"
23811,"We can just tell them we know.
"
23812,"The lying and the secrets
"
23813,"will be over.
"
23814,"Or, we can not tell them we know
"
23815,"and have a little fun of our own.
"
23816,"We better go if we're gonna
"
23817,"catch that movie.
"
23818,"- Bye.
"
23819,"- Bye.
"
23820,"Bye, Chandler. I miss you already.
"
23821,"Did you see
"
23822,"the inappropriate pinching?
"
23823,"Actually, I did.
"
23824,"So now do you believe
"
23825,"that she's attracted to me?
"
23826,"Oh, my God!
"
23827,"My God, she knows about us!
"
23828,"- Phoebe knows about us!
"
23829,"- I didn't tell them.
"
23830,"Them? Who's them?
"
23831,"Phoebe and Joey.
"
23832,"Joey!
"
23833,"And Rachel.
"
23834,"They made me promise not to tell.
"
23835,"They think they are so slick,
"
23836,"messing with us!
"
23837,"They don't know that we know
"
23838,"that they know.
"
23839,"- So... .
"
23840,"- Ah, yes!
"
23841,"The messers become the messees!
"
23842,"My God, he wants me to come
"
23843,"over and feel his biceps!
"
23844,"Are you kidding?
"
23845,"I can't believe he'd do that to Mo...
"
23846,"Joey? Do they know that we know?
"
23847,"- No.
"
23848,"- Joey!
"
23849,"- They know you know.
"
23850,"- I knew it!
"
23851,"I cannot believe those two!
"
23852,"They thought that they could
"
23853,"mess with us? With us?
"
23854,"They don't know that we know
"
23855,"they know we know.
"
23856,"Joey, you can't say anything.
"
23857,"Couldn't if I wanted to.
"
23858,"She wants me to put lotion on her!
"
23859,"She's bluffing!
"
23860,"She's not backing down.
"
23861,"She went like this.
"
23862,"He's not backing down.
"
23863,"He went to get lotion.
"
23864,"Aren't you guys done yet?
"
23865,"The sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler
"
23866,"the sooner this is all over.
"
23867,"- I like that.
"
23868,"- Okay.
"
23869,"Okay, show him your bra.
"
23870,"He's afraid of bras. Can't work them.
"
23871,"Wow! You didn't rip off
"
23872,"any buttons.
"
23873,"It's not my first time.
"
23874,"You go seduce her until she cracks.
"
23875,"Okay, give me a second.
"
23876,"- Did you clean up in here?
"
23877,"- Of course.
"
23878,"Oh, you're going?
"
23879,"Not without you, lover.
"
23880,"So, this is my bra.
"
23881,"It's very, very nice.
"
23882,"Well, come here.
"
23883,"I'm happy we're gonna
"
23884,"have all the sex.
"
23885,"You should be. I'm very bendy.
"
23886,"- I'm gonna kiss you.
"
23887,"- Not if I kiss you first.
"
23888,"There's nothing left
"
23889,"for us to do but kiss.
"
23890,"Here it comes.
"
23891,"Our first kiss.
"
23892,"- Okay, okay, okay, fine, you win!
"
23893,"- Ha!
"
23894,"- I can't have sex.
"
23895,"- Why not?
"
23896,"- I'm in love with Monica.
"
23897,"- You're what?
"
23898,"Love her! That's right, I love her!
"
23899,"I love her!
"
23900,"I love you, Monica.
"
23901,"I love you too, Chandler.
"
23902,"I thought you guys were doing it,
"
23903,"I didn't know you were in love.
"
23904,"That's it, it's over.
"
23905,"Everybody knows.
"
23906,"- Well, Ross doesn't.
"
23907,"- We'd like it if no one told him yet.
"
23908,"No.
"
23909,"What are you doing?
"
23910,"Get off my sister!
"
23911,"Friends getting married,
"
23912,"it's gotta change things.
"
23913,"Think it'll be different?
"
23914,"How can it not be?
"
23915,"They're gonna have kids...
"
23916,"...and hang out with other couples
"
23917,"who have kids.
"
23918,"And maybe they'll leave the city...
"
23919,"...to be near a Volvo dealership.
"
23920,"Things change.
"
23921,"I don't want them
"
23922,"to move to a Volvo dealership.
"
23923,"It'll be okay, Joe.
"
23924,"Sorry. I just...
"
23925,"I like things the way they are.
"
23926,"Who's this little naked guy?
"
23927,"That naked guy would be me.
"
23928,"Look at the little thing.
"
23929,"Yes.
"
23930,"Yes, fine, that is my penis.
"
23931,"Can we be grownups now?
"
23932,"- Who are those people?
"
23933,"- Got me.
"
23934,"Oh, that's Nana right there.
"
23935,"- Wow.
"
23936,"- Let's see.
"
23937,"""Me and the gang at Java Joe's. ""
"
23938,"Monica, you look like your grandma.
"
23939,"How old was she?
"
23940,"Let's see, 1939.
"
23941,"Yeah, 24, 25.
"
23942,"Looks like a fun gang.
"
23943,"Look, look, look!
"
23944,"I got Monica naked.
"
23945,"Let me see.
"
23946,"No, that would be me again.
"
23947,"- Hey, you guys.
"
23948,"- What's going on?
"
23949,"Well, we were just talking about...
"
23950,"...you guys getting married
"
23951,"and how great it is.
"
23952,"Yeah, you can get a Volvo.
"
23953,"If that's what you really want.
"
23954,"That's so sweet.
"
23955,"- So, we both finished our vows.
"
23956,"- Can we read them?
"
23957,"As long as I don't hear his
"
23958,"and he doesn't hear mine.
"
23959,"Oh, that's beautiful.
"
23960,"Funny one! Good!
"
23961,"Will you marry me?
"
23962,"What? I don't get it.
"
23963,"Oh, yeah!
"
23964,"- Man, this is hilarious!
"
23965,"- Chandler!
"
23966,"Don't worry, we'll make yours funnier.
"
23967,"Okay, what do you think?
"
23968,"- Dude... .
"
23969,"- I have never known love like this.
"
23970,"- You really like it?
"
23971,"- Dude!
"
23972,"How did you write this?
"
23973,"I stole Monica's
"
23974,"and changed the name.
"
23975,"- You can't do that!
"
23976,"- Lf he goes first he can!
"
23977,"<font color=""#ffff00"" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net
"
23978,"- Hey.
"
23979,"- Hey.
"
23980,"I saw the Porsche parked out front.
"
23981,"Can I get the keys?
"
23982,"I'll take that bad boy for a spin.
"
23983,"Ross drives it? When I ask, you say
"
23984,"you're the only one allowed to.
"
23985,"He's my brother, plus he drives
"
23986,"so slow he couldn't hurt it.
"
23987,"It's a car, Monica, not a rocket ship.
"
23988,"Just replace the bulbs in the
"
23989,"brake lights after you're done.
"
23990,"- Hey.
"
23991,"- Hi.
"
23992,"Saw the Porsche. Looking good.
"
23993,"When can I take it out again?
"
23994,"- You let Joey drive it?
"
23995,"- I've never driven it. Not once.
"
23996,"Okay, once. Okay, I drive it
"
23997,"all the time.
"
23998,"So much for the ""you-can-drive-it
"
23999,"but-don't-tell-Rachel"" plan.
"
24000,"Wow, I can't believe you lied to me.
"
24001,"I can fix this. Monica, Rachel thinks
"
24002,"all you talk about is the wedding.
"
24003,"I won't let you drive the Porsche
"
24004,"because you're a terrible driver.
"
24005,"There. That wasn't about the wedding.
"
24006,"If you want a ride in the Porsche,
"
24007,"I'll take you around the block.
"
24008,"You got a couple hours?

"
24012,"Whew, that was a brisk ride.
"
24013,"- Take the top down, did you?
"
24014,"- Only way to fly.
"
24015,"Give me the keys. Monica's wrong.
"
24016,"I'm an excellent driver.
"
24017,"You're fast and irresponsible.
"
24018,"That adds up to a bad driver.
"
24019,"In high school, that added up
"
24020,"to head cheerleader.
"
24021,"Did you see how she looked at me?
"
24022,"She must've seen me cruising
"
24023,"in the bad boy.
"
24024,"- She's checking out your beehive.
"
24025,"- What?
"
24026,"- Give me a brush.
"
24027,"- The keys.
"
24028,"- No way!
"
24029,"- Well, no brush.
"
24030,"Fine. It doesn't matter.
"

"
24034,"We still haven't gotten an
"
24035,"RSVP from your dad.
"
24036,"Oh, right. Maybe that's because I
"
24037,"didn't send him an invitation.
"
24038,"He's your father.
"
24039,"He should be at our wedding.
"
24040,"I don't even know him.
"
24041,"I haven't seen him in years.
"
24042,"And when he finds out
"
24043,"he wasn't asked?
"
24044,"We don't run in the same circles.
"
24045,"I hang out with you guys and he...
"
24046,"...stars in a drag show in Vegas.
"
24047,"I think I want to trade circles.
"
24048,"You don't want him there.
"
24049,"Nobody will stare at the bride...

"

"
24052,"As long as he's not wearing a

"
24054,"I think I need to do some shopping.
"
24055,"Nice.
"
24056,"My God!
"
24057,"- What do you think you're doing?
"
24058,"- Just washing the windshield.
"
24059,"There's no way I'll let you
"
24060,"drive this car.
"
24061,"Just hand over the keys.
"
24062,"Oh!
"
24063,"Do not start this car.
"
24064,"Okay, okay.
"
24065,"I will give you 20 bucks...
"
24066,"...if you get out of this car
"
24067,"right now. Hey!
"
24068,"Look.
"
24069,"If you're so freaked out,
"
24070,"get in the car.
"
24071,"With you? Yeah, right.
"
24072,"All right.
"
24073,"Okay, okay, okay.
"
24074,"- What are you doing? Get in front.
"
24075,"- In the death seat?!
"
24076,"- Hey, guys.
"
24077,"- Hi, sweetie.
"
24078,"- Ready to go?
"
24079,"- My purse is at Mon's. I'll be back.
"
24080,"- Wait a minute.
"
24081,"- What? Oh.
"
24082,"That one kept going.
"
24083,"So, you and Phoebe, huh?
"
24084,"- How long have you been going out?
"
24085,"- A month.
"
24086,"We ought to get to
"
24087,"know each other better.
"
24088,"- Sure. I'd like that.
"
24089,"- Yeah. So, uh... .
"
24090,"What's your name?
"
24091,"- It's Jake.
"
24092,"- Joey.
"
24093,"- Do you like the Knicks?
"
24094,"- Yeah, big fan.
"
24095,"Me too. There's a game Tuesday.
"
24096,"Do you want to go?
"
24097,"Great! Let me make sure I'm not
"
24098,"doing anything Tuesday.
"
24099,"Here.
"
24100,"- What's this?
"
24101,"- Your suitcase. We're going to Vegas.
"
24102,"Are you serious? Eloping?
"
24103,"No more stupid wedding stuff.
"
24104,"No more these flowers, these flowers.
"
24105,"Think of the money we'll save.
"
24106,"We're not eloping.
"
24107,"Can our wedding be bigger, please?
"
24108,"We're going to see your dad.
"
24109,"I want to get to know
"
24110,"my father-in-law.
"
24111,"When we went over this, I won.
"
24112,"No, you didn't.
"
24113,"Honey, just so you know... .
"
24114,"Now that you're marrying me,
"
24115,"you don't get to win anymore.
"
24116,"Forget it. I don't want to go.
"
24117,"I don't want to see him.
"
24118,"I know your dad embarrassed you.
"
24119,"All kids are embarrassed
"
24120,"by their parents.
"
24121,"You need a new word
"
24122,"for what I went through.
"
24123,"In high school,
"
24124,"he came to all my swim meets...
"
24125,"...dressed as a Hollywood starlet.
"
24126,"Hard enough to be 14, skinny, wearing
"
24127,"Speedos Mom promised I'd grow into.
"
24128,"You look up in the stands.
"
24129,"There's your dad cheering you on.
"
24130,"Dressed as Carmen Miranda, wearing
"
24131,"a headdress with real fruit...
"
24132,"...that he'll later give to your
"
24133,"friends as a healthy snack.
"
24134,"He was at every one of your swim meets
"
24135,"cheering you on.
"
24136,"That's a pretty great dad.
"
24137,"He had sex with Mr. Garibaldi.
"
24138,"- Who's Mr. Garibaldi?
"
24139,"- Does it matter?!
"
24140,"You're not 14 anymore, okay? Maybe
"
24141,"it's time you let that stuff go.
"
24142,"If he's not at your wedding, you'll
"
24143,"regret it for the rest of your life.
"
24144,"Okay, but I'm just doing this for you.
"
24145,"- I never get to win anymore?
"
24146,"- How much did you ever win before?
"
24147,"You know how when you're wearing
"
24148,"pants and you lean forward...
"
24149,"...I check out your underwear?
"
24150,"Well, when Jake did it...
"
24151,"...I saw that he was wearing
"
24152,"women's underwear.
"
24153,"I know. They were mine.
"
24154,"Oh!
"
24155,"No, no, wait. That's weird.
"
24156,"We were goofing around,
"
24157,"and I dared him to try them on.
"
24158,"That's weird!
"
24159,"- I'm wearing his briefs right now.
"
24160,"- That's kind of hot.
"
24161,"I think so too. And that little flap?
"
24162,"Great for holding my lipstick.
"
24163,"I wouldn't know about that.
"
24164,"Jake says that women's underwear
"
24165,"is actually more comfortable.
"
24166,"He loves how silk feels
"
24167,"against his skin.
"
24168,"Next he'll say your high heels
"
24169,"are good for his posture.
"
24170,"There's nothing wrong with Jake.
"
24171,"He is all man.
"
24172,"I think more than you.
"
24173,"He looked like a real lumberjack
"
24174,"in those pink lacies.
"
24175,"Only a man completely secure
"
24176,"in his masculinity could...
"
24177,"...walk around in women's underwear.
"
24178,"I don't think you could.
"
24179,"- I am secure with my masculinity.
"
24180,"- Okay, whatever.
"
24181,"You've seen my huge stack of porn.
"
24182,"God, I forgot how much I love driving.
"
24183,"I have got to get my license renewed.
"
24184,"You don't have a valid driver's
"
24185,"license? Pull over right now.
"
24186,"You're so tense.
"
24187,"You just gotta relax, okay?
"
24188,"Okay? Just need to relax. All right?
"
24189,"Just need to relax.
"
24190,"What are you...? That's not funny.
"
24191,"Stop horsing around.
"
24192,"I am not horsing around, okay?
"
24193,"I am ""Porsche-ing"" around.
"
24194,"Uh-oh.
"
24195,"Stay calm. Nothing will happen.
"
24196,"You're not in that much trouble.
"
24197,"Really? You think so?
"
24198,"I'm talking to myself.
"
24199,"You're going down!
"
24200,"Has someone taken your order?
"
24201,"Oh, yeah. She did. He did. She?
"
24202,"I'm sorry, I'm new. I don't... .
"
24203,"- I just ordered a beer.
"
24204,"- You're straight. I get it.
"
24205,"If we called your dad,
"
24206,"we'd have better seats.
"
24207,"I don't want him to know we're
"
24208,"here yet. I'm not ready.
"
24209,"He won't be too happy
"
24210,"to see me either.
"
24211,"Why not?
"
24212,"He's kind of tried to contact me...
"
24213,"...a lot the last few years.
"
24214,"- What?
"
24215,"Yeah. He's made phone calls,
"
24216,"written letters.
"
24217,"He came to New York.
"
24218,"I said I was too busy.
"
24219,"It's very ""Cats in the Cradle. ""
"
24220,"I don't want to get into it.
"
24221,"Here we go.
"
24222,"Ladies and gentlemen, 
"
24223,"welcome the incomparable... 
"
24224,"... Helena Handbasket. 
"
24225,"Hello, darlings.
"
24226,"And there's Daddy.
"
24227,"Switch places with me. Come on!
"
24228,"I'll go under, you go over.
"
24229,"- Yeah, I'll get right on that.
"
24230,"- Come on!
"
24231,"What? No. Hey, Rach, come on.
"
24232,"I'm sure we won't get arrested
"
24233,"for this.
"
24234,"Hi, officer.
"
24235,"Was I going a little too fast?
"
24236,"Oh, my God.
"
24237,"- Can I see your license, please?
"
24238,"- Absolutely.
"
24239,"It's weird. I had a dream last night
"
24240,"that I was stopped by a policeman.
"
24241,"And then he... .
"
24242,"Well, I probably shouldn't
"
24243,"tell you the rest.
"
24244,"- Your license.
"
24245,"- Yes. Here you go, Officer...
"
24246,"...Handsome.
"
24247,"- It's Hanson.
"
24248,"- Oops, sorry. My mistake.
"
24249,"Dear Lord!
"
24250,"- Wow!
"
24251,"- Here it comes.
"
24252,"This is a great picture.
"
24253,"Really? You think so? You know,
"
24254,"I had just rolled right out of bed.
"
24255,"You look phenomenal.
"
24256,"She should!
"
24257,"It was taken 10 years ago!
"
24258,"You know, you probably...
"
24259,"...wonder about the old date.
"
24260,"Yes. You're an Aquarius, huh?
"
24261,"- I'll bet you're a Gemini.
"
24262,"- No.
"
24263,"- Taurus?
"
24264,"- No.
"
24265,"- Virgo?
"
24266,"- No.
"
24267,"- Sagittarius?
"
24268,"- Yep.
"
24269,"I knew it. I knew it!
"
24270,"You won't speed anymore, right?
"
24271,"I won't speed.
"
24272,"- Promise to take care of this?
"
24273,"- I promise.
"
24274,"Let him drive.
"
24275,"Does he have a license?
"
24276,"- Can he handle a stick?
"
24277,"- Well... .
"
24278,"I can handle a stick!
"
24279,"- That can't be your father.
"
24280,"- I've been saying that for years.
"
24281,"- Oh, my God!
"
24282,"- What?
"
24283,"That's Mr. Garibaldi
"
24284,"playing the piano.
"
24285,"Hello, and welcome to the show.
"
24286,"I see some of our regulars
"
24287,"in the audience.
"
24288,"And a couple of irregulars.
"
24289,"- He's coming into the audience.
"
24290,"- Relax. You'll be fine.
"
24291,"Oh, much better.
"
24292,"You're invisible now.
"
24293,"- Where are you from?
"
24294,"- Bakersfield.
"
24295,"- I'm sorry?
"
24296,"- Bakersfield.
"
24297,"No, no, I heard. I'm just sorry.
"
24298,"I'll meet you back at the hotel.
"
24299,"Look, a standing ovation already.
"
24300,"So early in the show.
"
24301,"Turn around, darling.
"
24302,"Let me see your pretty face.
"
24303,"Can we have our drinks, please?
"
24304,"Waiter? ...tress?
"
24305,"- Hey, Pheebs.
"
24306,"- Hey.
"
24307,"Check it out.
"
24308,"How much of a man am I?
"
24309,"Wow, nice.
"
24310,"Manly, and also kind of a slut.
"
24311,"I'm beginning to see what Jake
"
24312,"was talking about.
"
24313,"The silk feels really good.
"
24314,"And things aren't as smashed down
"
24315,"as I thought they would be.
"
24316,"That's great.
"
24317,"You have so many more choices
"
24318,"than with men's underwear.
"
24319,"Bikini, French cut, thong.
"
24320,"And the fabrics: cotton, silk, lace.
"
24321,"You know what I've always
"
24322,"wondered about? Pantyhose!
"
24323,"The way they start at your toe,
"
24324,"then they go all the way up to...
"
24325,"- I should go take these off.
"
24326,"- I think it's important you do.
"
24327,"What's your name?
"
24328,"Chandler.
"
24329,"Chandler?
"
24330,"What an unusual name.
"
24331,"You must have had terribly
"
24332,"fascinating parents.
"
24333,"Oh, they're a hoot.
"
24334,"And who is your friend?
"
24335,"I'm Monica.
"
24336,"- Monica. Where are you from?
"
24337,"- New York.
"
24338,"I'm not very fond of New York.
"
24339,"Queens, I like.
"
24340,"What is this...
"
24341,"...sparkling something, honey, huh?
"
24342,"Actually, Monica and I are engaged.
"
24343,"Really?
"
24344,"Congratulations.
"
24345,"When's the big day?
"
24346,"In two weeks.
"
24347,"I see.
"
24348,"Well, I wish you both
"
24349,"a lifetime of happiness.
"
24350,"So, you're bald.
"
24351,"Wait, wait.
"
24352,"We'd love it if you could be there.
"
24353,"Really?
"
24354,"I know it would make me happy...
"
24355,"...ma'am.
"
24356,"Then I wouldn't miss it for the world.
"
24357,"I'm getting all misty here.
"
24358,"You'd think I was having my legs waxed
"
24359,"or something.
"
24360,"- You okay?
"
24361,"- Yeah.
"
24362,"Thanks for making me do this.
"
24363,"Before we go on with the show, I want
"
24364,"to say to the bride and groom...
"
24365,"...how lucky they are to have
"
24366,"found each other.
"
24367,"In every life a little rain must fall.
"
24368,"Fortunately...
"
24369,"...in my life... .
"
24370,"When I was growing up, I played
"
24371,"the one on the far left.
"
24372,"Remind me to introduce you
"
24373,"to someone.
"
24374,"- Who?
"
24375,"- Fourth gear.
"
24376,"What does he want?
"
24377,"I wasn't doing anything.
"
24378,"Maybe he saw your hands slip briefly
"
24379,"from the 10 and 2:00 position.
"
24380,"Maybe it's Sergeant Sagittarius
"
24381,"coming back to flirt some more.
"
24382,"It's a different guy.
"
24383,"- Good evening, sir.
"
24384,"- Do you know how fast you were going?
"
24385,"No, I don't, but it couldn't
"
24386,"have been more than 60.
"
24387,"You're right. It was 37.
"
24388,"You're not ticketing me
"
24389,"for driving too slow, are you?
"
24390,"That's right.
"
24391,"You know, officer... .
"
24392,"I had the weirdest dream last night.
"
24393,"Oh, my God!
"
24394,"Your license, please.
"
24395,"You don't want to hear
"
24396,"about my dream...
"
24397,"...Officer...
"
24398,"...Pretty?
"
24399,"It's Petty.
"
24400,"I'll be right back with your ticket.
"
24401,"- You have a son.
"
24402,"- I know. I know.
"
24403,"- Feel better?
"
24404,"- Yeah. Much.
"
24405,"Listen... .
"
24406,"Not that I'm insecure about
"
24407,"my manhood or anything, but...
"
24408,"...I need to hook up with
"
24409,"a woman right now.
"
24410,"I understand.
"
24411,"You look familiar. Do I know you?
"
24412,"I don't think so.
"
24413,"Maybe it's because I'm on television.
"
24414,"- I'm an actor on Days of our Lives. 
"
24415,"- Wow. Really?
"
24416,"- $4.50, please.
"
24417,"- Oh, let me get this.
"
24418,"These are for you.

24420,"Do you realize this is the last time
"
24421,"we'll be here...
"
24422,"...as six single people?
"
24423,"What's happening to the coffeehouse?
"
24424,"From now on, it's you four
"
24425,"and me and the missus.
"
24426,"The little woman. The wife.
"
24427,"The old ball and chain.
"
24428,"- Old?
"
24429,"- The young, hot ball and chain.
"
24430,"- Much better.
"
24431,"- We gotta go.
"
24432,"- Where?
"
24433,"- Get the dress and lunch with mom.
"
24434,"Joey, you too?
"
24435,"I just heard ""lunch. ""
"
24436,"Yeah, I can go. Sure.
"
24437,"Actually, I'm glad they're leaving.
"
24438,"I need to talk to you
"
24439,"about something.
"
24440,"- What's up?
"
24441,"- This may be a little awkward.
"
24442,"If you need money, it's a bad time.
"
24443,"I'm buying 128 dinners tomorrow.
"
24444,"No, it's not that.
"
24445,"I'm not gonna say this
"
24446,"as your friend...
"
24447,"...but as Monica's older brother.
"
24448,"- But you're still my friend?
"
24449,"- Not for a few minutes.
"
24450,"- Right now, are you still my best man?
"
24451,"- No.
"
24452,"Do I still call you Ross?
"
24453,"You guys are getting married,
"
24454,"and I couldn't be more thrilled.
"
24455,"But as her older brother,
"
24456,"I have to tell you this:
"
24457,"If you ever hurt my little sister...
"
24458,"...if you ever cause her
"
24459,"any unhappiness of any kind...
"
24460,"...I will hunt you down...
"
24461,"...and kick your ass.
"
24462,"What? I'm serious.
"
24463,"- Dude! Stop it! I'm not kidding.
"
24464,"- I hear what you're saying...
"
24465,"...and thanks for the warning.
"
24466,"No problem.
"
24467,"Are we friends again?
"
24468,"Yeah.
"
24469,"You won't believe what Monica's
"
24470,"brother just said to me!
"
24471,"The One With Monica
"
24472,"and Chandler's Wedding
"
24473,"What you doing, Mon?
"
24474,"I'm listing things that
"
24475,"could go wrong at the wedding.
"
24476,"So I can be prepared.
"
24477,"- What are they?
"
24478,"- ""The dresses won't get picked up...
"
24479,"...veil gets lost,
"
24480,"and I'm missing something blue. ""
"
24481,"I'm responsible for all those.
"
24482,"I had to go with the odds.
"
24483,"Remember I didn't get that part?
"
24484,"The commercial?
"
24485,"That play?
"
24486,"That other play?
"
24487,"- The movie?
"
24488,"- Yes!
"
24489,"The one about the dog
"
24490,"who flies planes?
"
24491,"No. But man, that one hurt.
"
24492,"- This is the one about WWI soldiers.
"
24493,"- Oh, yeah.
"
24494,"Back then we called it
"
24495,"""The Great War. ""
"
24496,"It really was.
"
24497,"A guy they wanted backed out!
"
24498,"I start shooting today!
"
24499,"Congratulations!
"
24500,"- Today's the dinner.
"
24501,"- I'll be done by then.
"
24502,"Oh. Then way to go,
"
24503,"you big movie star!
"
24504,"See you. I'm off
"
24505,"to fight the Nazis.
"
24506,"Wait, Joey. We fought the Nazis
"
24507,"in WWII, not WWI.
"
24508,"Whoa.
"
24509,"Who was in WWI?
"
24510,"Go ahead.
"
24511,"You're gonna be late!
"
24512,"Go! Go!
"
24513,"Who did we fight in WWI?
"
24514,"- Mexico?
"
24515,"- Yes. Very good.
"
24516,"- Hey, Joey. We're ready.
"
24517,"- Yeah, me too.
"
24518,"Richard, we're ready for you.
"
24519,"Joey Tribbiani, Richard Crosby
"
24520,"is playing Vincent.
"
24521,"- I'm acting with you?
"
24522,"- Nice to meet you.
"
24523,"I can't believe this. Incredible.
"
24524,"You just won an Oscar.
"
24525,"No, I didn't.
"
24526,"I think you did.
"
24527,"I think I lost, three times.
"
24528,"- Cookie? Would you...?
"
24529,"- No.
"
24530,"We're about an hour away
"
24531,"from getting the scene lit.
"
24532,"- Can you guys run it a couple times?
"
24533,"- Yeah, sure.
"
24534,"All right. Let's do it.
"
24535,"And... action!
"
24536,"- We have to find the platoon!
"
24537,"- Forget it, the platoon is gone!
"
24538,"- What?
"
24539,"- Platoon's dead! Face facts, Tony!
"
24540,"What'll we do?
"
24541,"We have no reinforcements or food.
"
24542,"There's food in the basement.
"
24543,"Potatoes and some pasta.
"
24544,"Hang on. Joey, you keep
"
24545,"touching your face.
"
24546,"Something wrong?
"
24547,"No.
"
24548,"I thought it might be
"
24549,"a cool character thing.
"
24550,"He's a face toucher.
"
24551,"I don't think so.
"
24552,"Let's take it back
"
24553,"to Richard's last lines. Action!
"
24554,"No weapons, but we still have food.
"
24555,"Potatoes, pasta...
"
24556,"...and a few tins of tuna!
"
24557,"Honey, we gotta go!
"
24558,"Here's a question
"
24559,"you never want to ask:
"
24560,"Can my dad borrow one of your
"
24561,"pearl necklaces?
"
24562,"Did he say what kind of neckline
"
24563,"he's wearing?
"
24564,"No.
"
24565,"I just met him once,
"
24566,"but I'm guessing...
"
24567,"...plunging?
"
24568,"He is more of a if-you've-got-it-
"
24569,"flaunt-it kind of father.
"
24570,"Let me see if Rachel has anything.
"
24571,"Yes, include more people.
"
24572,"Do you realize that tomorrow
"
24573,"we're gonna be getting married?
"
24574,"I have a date tomorrow night.
"
24575,"- I can't believe we made it.
"
24576,"- Don't sound so surprised.
"
24577,"I'm sorry, but... .
"
24578,"- Nothing.
"
24579,"- What?
"
24580,"Well, honestly?
"
24581,"Ever since we got engaged...
"
24582,"...I've waited for you to flip out.
"
24583,"Honestly? Me too.
"
24584,"- Really?
"
24585,"- Yeah.
"
24586,"I think that something
"
24587,"will come up and I'll...
"
24588,"...go all Chandler.
"
24589,"- But nothing has.
"
24590,"- I'm so glad.
"
24591,"Thank you for staying
"
24592,"so calm during this.
"
24593,"It's made me stay calm.
"
24594,"I could've been worse.
"
24595,"I'll be right there.
"
24596,"Before Saturday, you've reached
"
24597,"Monica and Chandler. 
"
24598,"But if you're calling after Saturday, 
"
24599,"you've reached Mr. And Mrs. Bing. 
"
24600,"Please leave a message for... 
"
24601,"the Bings! 
"
24602,"Maureen!
"
24603,"- This is my cousin, Maureen.
"
24604,"- We're the Bings.
"
24605,"Hi! You guys look so beautiful.
"
24606,"Mr. And Mrs. Bing!
"
24607,"Wow, Monica.
"
24608,"So you know, I had my
"
24609,"older-brother talk with Chandler.
"
24610,"What is that?
"
24611,"I told him that if he ever hurt you...
"
24612,"...I would hunt him down
"
24613,"and kick his ass.
"
24614,"What is the matter with everybody?
"
24615,"I'm serious.
"
24616,"I would kick his ass!
"
24617,"Ross, please, my makeup!
"
24618,"- Chandler.
"
24619,"- Mom.
"
24620,"Thanks for wearing... something.
"
24621,"This is so exciting! I thought we
"
24622,"screwed you up too much for this.
"
24623,"Just think, soon there will be
"
24624,"lots of little Bings.
"
24625,"I can't believe I'm going back
"
24626,"to get spit on again.
"
24627,"You're lucky, the people
"
24628,"who spit on you are famous.
"
24629,"- Who spits on you?
"
24630,"- I don't want to talk about work.
"
24631,"Mrs. Bing? These are my parents,
"
24632,"Judy and Jack Geller.
"
24633,"- It's lovely to meet you.
"
24634,"- Are you his mother or father?
"
24635,"Jack!
"
24636,"What? I've never seen one before.
"
24637,"Dad, there's Ross.
"
24638,"Go talk to him.
"
24639,"I wasn't even able to act
"
24640,"like I'm okay with it.
"
24641,"Hello, all.
"
24642,"Hi... Dad.
"
24643,"Hi, Mr. Bing.
"
24644,"- Nora.
"
24645,"- Charles.
"
24646,"- It's so great to see you both here.
"
24647,"- Yes.
"
24648,"Although we may be seeing
"
24649,"too much of some people.
"
24650,"Aren't you too old
"
24651,"to wear a dress like that?
"
24652,"Don't you have too much penis
"
24653,"to wear a dress like that?
"
24654,"Oh, my God.
"
24655,"Of course you can kick his ass, son.
"
24656,"You could kick anyone's ass
"
24657,"you want to.
"
24658,"Thanks, you guys.
"
24659,"- Rach, Rach?
"
24660,"- Yeah?
"
24661,"Talk to Chandler's dad and
"
24662,"keep him away from Chandler's mom.
"
24663,"- What's he look like?
"
24664,"- A man in a black dress.
"
24665,"I'm Rachel, a friend of
"
24666,"Monica and Chandler's.
"
24667,"- I'm Amanda.
"
24668,"- Oh, I get it.
"
24669,"""A man, duh! ""
"
24670,"Could I have your attention?
"
24671,"- I'm Ross Geller.
"
24672,"- Dr. Ross Geller.
"
24673,"Dad, please. As I was saying...
"
24674,"...I'm Dr. Ross Geller.
"
24675,"And I'm the best man.
"
24676,"This marriage
"
24677,"is doubly special for me...
"
24678,"...because not only is the groom
"
24679,"my best friend...
"
24680,"...but the bride is my little sister.
"
24681,"She's the greatest sister
"
24682,"a guy could ask for.
"
24683,"Please join me in raising a glass...
"
24684,"...to the couple we're
"
24685,"here to celebrate.
"
24686,"- To the Bings.
"
24687,"- To the Bings!
"
24688,"I'm gonna steam my dress.
"
24689,"Who will make sure nothing
"
24690,"happens to it?
"
24691,"- I'll do it.
"
24692,"- Who wants it? Anybody?
"
24693,"- I said I'll do it.
"
24694,"- Nobody?
"
24695,"- All right, I'll do it myself.
"
24696,"- I'm not gonna screw it up.
"
24697,"You're right. I'm sorry.
"
24698,"You were a big help tonight.
"
24699,"Thanks for helping
"
24700,"my grandmother get to the hotel.
"
24701,"- Of course! That's what I'm here for.
"
24702,"- Okay. Sorry.
"
24703,"What grandmother?
"
24704,"- Where have you been?
"
24705,"- Taking my parents to the hotel.
"
24706,"- Going back to work?
"
24707,"- Yeah.
"
24708,"- Nice shades.
"
24709,"- Lf I wear these in my scenes...
"
24710,"...I won't get spit in my eyes.
"
24711,"And, if I remember correctly, Ray-Ban
"
24712,"was the official sponsor of WWI.
"
24713,"Great! All right!
"
24714,"I'll see you later.
"
24715,"- Where's Chandler?
"
24716,"- I think he's in Rachel's room.
"
24717,"Chandler?
"
24718,"- Is Monica here?
"
24719,"- She's steaming her dress. Why?
"
24720,"- I think Chandler's gone.
"
24721,"- What?
"
24722,"- He left that.
"
24723,"- ""Tell Monica I'm sorry. ""
"
24724,"Oh, my God.
"
24725,"What's up?
"
24726,"""Tell Monica I'm sorry. ""
"
24727,"Tell her yourself.
"
24728,"Oh, my God.
"
24729,"Chandler just left, though?
"
24730,"Maybe it's not what we think.
"
24731,"""Tell Monica I'm sorry
"
24732,"I drank the last of the milk. ""
"
24733,"Or maybe he was writing to tell
"
24734,"her that he's changed his name:
"
24735,"""Tell Monica, I'm Sorry. ""
"
24736,"- It means he freaked out and left!
"
24737,"- Don't be so negative!
"
24738,"Good God, isn't it possible that
"
24739,"""Sorry"" is sitting in there right now?
"
24740,"Phoebe, I think Ross is right.
"
24741,"What are we gonna do?
"
24742,"I'm gonna have to go find him
"
24743,"and bring him back.
"
24744,"You make sure Monica
"
24745,"does not find out, okay?
"
24746,"But, if you don't find him
"
24747,"and bring him back...
"
24748,"...I am gonna hunt you down
"
24749,"and kick your ass!
"
24750,"I will find him.
"
24751,"Joey? Can you
"
24752,"go through these lines with me?
"
24753,"Oh, man, they just re-did my makeup.
"
24754,"- Just the last two pages.
"
24755,"- All right.
"
24756,"I found the picture!
"
24757,"Picture? What picture?
"
24758,"The picture of my wife
"
24759,"I found in your pack.
"
24760,"- Could you lower the script?
"
24761,"- I don't want to.
"
24762,"I need to see your face so
"
24763,"I can play off your reaction.
"
24764,"Okay, look.
"
24765,"I know you're great
"
24766,"and play all those Shakespeare guys...
"
24767,"...but you're spitting
"
24768,"all over me, man.
"
24769,"- Of course I am!
"
24770,"- You know you've been spitting?
"
24771,"That's what real actors do.
"
24772,"Enunciation is the mark
"
24773,"of a good actor.
"
24774,"And when you enunciate, you spit!
"
24775,"Wow. Didn't know that.
"
24776,"Thanks. Okay, check it out.
"
24777,"Picture? What picture?
"
24778,"- Have you seen Chandler?
"
24779,"- No, I haven't seen him.
"
24780,"- Damn.
"
24781,"- He's getting married tomorrow, right?
"
24782,"Yes. Don't worry.
"
24783,"Everything's fine.
"
24784,"- See you at the wedding.
"
24785,"- I wasn't invited.
"
24786,"Then we'll see you the
"
24787,"day after tomorrow.
"
24788,"Mom? Dad?
"
24789,"What are you doing here?
"
24790,"We thought we'd see what
"
24791,"the fuss is all about.
"
24792,"- I see why the girls like coming here.
"
24793,"- Why?
"
24794,"The sexy blond behind the counter.
"
24795,"- Gunther?
"
24796,"- She just added him to her list.
"
24797,"- Your list?
"
24798,"- Of people we're allowed to sleep...
"
24799,"I know what the list is.
"
24800,"Come on, sit down.
"
24801,"Have a cup of joe.
"
24802,"Dad, I can't. I'm sorry.
"
24803,"If you see Chandler,
"
24804,"tell him I'm looking for him.
"
24805,"And if you see Rita Moreno,
"
24806,"let her know I'm looking for her.
"
24807,"Action!
"
24808,"I found the picture!
"
24809,"What picture?
"
24810,"A picture of my wife, in your pack!
"
24811,"You went through my personal property?
"
24812,"Why do you have a picture of Paulette
"
24813,"in your pack?
"
24814,"Because, Vincent, we were lovers...
"
24815,"...for two years!
"
24816,"Cut! Wonderful!
"
24817,"Great scene, huh?
"
24818,"You were awesome. In that
"
24819,"last speech, you soaked me.
"
24820,"- Tomorrow's call sheet.
"
24821,"- I'm not working tomorrow.
"
24822,"- You are now.
"
24823,"- No, you gotta get me out of it.
"
24824,"I have plans. Important plans!
"
24825,"- Still no word from Chandler.
"
24826,"- Oh, man.
"
24827,"But they found the grandmother
"
24828,"wandering down 5th.
"
24829,"Okay, well there's one down.
"
24830,"I'm getting married today!
"
24831,"I cracked a rib, but I don't care.
"
24832,"Today's my wedding!
"
24833,"My day is finally here!
"
24834,"She might not even notice he's gone.
"
24835,"I'm gonna start getting ready!
"
24836,"We can't let her start getting ready.
"
24837,"This is too awful!
"
24838,"She'll be in the gown,
"
24839,"and he won't show up.
"
24840,"Then she'll
"
24841,"have to take off the gown...
"
24842,"Stop it. You can't do this here.
"
24843,"I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
"
24844,"It's just so sad.
"
24845,"Pull it together.
"
24846,"She can't see you like this.
"
24847,"- She'll know something's wrong.
"
24848,"- I know. I know.
"
24849,"There's no tissue.
"
24850,"Can you grab me some toilet paper?
"
24851,"Oh, that's gone too.
"
24852,"This is Monica's bathroom, right?
"
24853,"I found one.
"
24854,"Thank you.
"
24855,"Oh, God.
"
24856,"Can I have another one?
"
24857,"Sure.
"
24858,"Do you need some floss?
"
24859,"I can't imagine what will happen
"
24860,"if he doesn't show up.
"
24861,"Here's a whole bunch.
"
24862,"She'll be at the wedding waiting...
"
24863,"...and people will be whispering,
"
24864,"""That poor girl. ""
"
24865,"Then she'll have to come back here
"
24866,"and live alone.
"
24867,"- Oh, my God.
"
24868,"- What?
"
24869,"There was a pregnancy test in the
"
24870,"garbage, and it's positive.
"
24871,"Monica's pregnant.
"
24872,"So I guess she won't be totally alone.
"
24873,"Next time on Friends:
"
24874,"- We've gotta tell her.
"
24875,"- No, we can't.
"
24876,"She's getting ready.
"
24877,"Can't you stall her?
"
24878,"I'm never gonna get married.
"
24879,"We've just got one scene with you two,
"
24880,"and Richard is a pro.
"
24881,"- Are you drunk?
"
24882,"- No!
"
24883,"Yes, you are!
"
24884,"All right.
"
24885,"- How's Chandler?
"
24886,"- Great!
"
24887,"- Where are you?
"
24888,"- On the set.
"
24889,"It's turning into the worst
"
24890,"wedding ever.

"
24895,"Oh, my God!
"
24896,"I know. Monica's gonna have a baby!
"
24897,"Can this count as her ""something new""?
"
24898,"Oh, my God.
"
24899,"Do you think
"
24900,"this is why he took off?
"
24901,"She had to have just taken it.
"
24902,"I took out the trash last night.
"
24903,"It's turning into
"
24904,"the worst wedding ever.
"
24905,"The bride's pregnant, the groom's
"
24906,"missing and I'm holding this.
"
24907,"Phoebe, we cannot tell
"
24908,"anyone about this.
"
24909,"- Right. Yeah.
"
24910,"- Okay?
"
24911,"Do you know what kind
"
24912,"of birth control she uses?
"
24913,"No. Why?
"
24914,"Just for the future.
"
24915,"This is hardly a commercial for it.
"
24916,"The One With Monica
"
24917,"and Chandler's Wedding
"
24918,"Anything?
"
24919,"No. I talked to Joey.
"
24920,"He hasn't heard from him.
"
24921,"I talked to Chandler's parents again.
"
24922,"- You said he was missing?
"
24923,"- No.
"
24924,"It seemed like I called to chat.
"
24925,"Pretty sure they both think
"
24926,"I'm interested.
"
24927,"- We've got to tell her.
"
24928,"- No, we can't.
"
24929,"She'll start getting ready soon.
"
24930,"Can't you stall her? I'll go
"
24931,"to the places I went last night.
"
24932,"How much time?
"
24933,"How long before she has to get ready?
"
24934,"- One hour.
"
24935,"- Give me two.
"
24936,"Then why do you ask?
"
24937,"- Wish me luck.
"
24938,"- I'm going with you.
"
24939,"Why?
"
24940,"You're tired. You looked all night.
"
24941,"And clearly, you suck at this.
"
24942,"See you later.
"
24943,"Wait, do you know how
"
24944,"you're gonna stall her?
"
24945,"- I'll figure something out.
"
24946,"- Okay, good luck.
"
24947,"Let's start with my makeup
"
24948,"and then do my hair.
"
24949,"Okay. But before you do that,
"
24950,"I need you to talk to me.
"
24951,"About what?
"
24952,"I'm never gonna get married!
"
24953,"You will. The right
"
24954,"guy's around the corner.
"
24955,"Okay, are we done with that?
"
24956,"No, I'm serious.
"
24957,"Maybe I should just forget about it.
"
24958,"Become a lesbian or something.
"
24959,"Any woman would be lucky to have you.
"
24960,"Maybe I'd feel better
"
24961,"if I slept with Joey.
"
24962,"Rachel? Are you okay?
"
24963,"Excuse me, Aaron? I have
"
24964,"a little problem with the schedule.
"
24965,"I wasn't supposed to work today.
"
24966,"I have a wedding that I have to be at.
"
24967,"It's my best friend's,
"
24968,"and I'm officiating...
"
24969,"...so I really can't work past 4.
"
24970,"You've gotta stay until the end.
"
24971,"We can't stop filming just for you.
"
24972,"It's not like it's your wedding.
"
24973,"I'm having surgery.
"
24974,"What?
"
24975,"I made up the wedding,
"
24976,"because I didn't want you to worry.
"
24977,"But I'm having surgery today.
"
24978,"What kind of surgery?
"
24979,"Transplant.
"
24980,"You're supposed to work on Monday.
"
24981,"Hair transplant.
"
24982,"But you're not bald.
"
24983,"It's not on my head.
"
24984,"There's nothing I can do.
"
24985,"You'll probably be out by 4 anyway.
"
24986,"We've got one scene. It's just you
"
24987,"and Richard, and he's a pro.
"
24988,"You'll be fine.
"
24989,"Morning, Richard.
"
24990,"Hey, you're here! Great!
"
24991,"Let's go, buddy!
"
24992,"We got a scene to shoot!
"
24993,"I'm wearing two belts.
"
24994,"- Are you drunk?
"
24995,"- No.
"
24996,"Yes, you are!
"
24997,"All right.
"
24998,"So this is your office?
"
24999,"How'd you guys find me?
"
25000,"I knew I should've hid at the gym.
"
25001,"- What the hell are you doing?
"
25002,"- Panicking.
"
25003,"And using the Internet to try to prove
"
25004,"that I'm related to Monica.
"
25005,"- How is she?
"
25006,"- She doesn't know you're gone.
"
25007,"And she doesn't have to know.
"
25008,"Come on, we're going home.
"
25009,"- I can't do that.
"
25010,"- Why not?
"
25011,"If I go home,
"
25012,"we're gonna become the Bings.
"
25013,"I can't be the Bings.
"
25014,"What's wrong with it?
"
25015,"The Bings have bad marriages.
"
25016,"They yell, fight,
"
25017,"and use the pool boy...
"
25018,"...as a pawn in their sexual games.
"
25019,"Have you ever put on a black dress
"
25020,"and asked me up to your hotel room?
"
25021,"- No.
"
25022,"- Then you are neither of your parents.
"
25023,"It's not just their marriage.
"
25024,"Look at yours. Look at everybody's.
"
25025,"Only Paul Newman
"
25026,"can make marriage work.
"
25027,"And I am no Paul Newman.
"
25028,"I don't race cars or make popcorn.
"
25029,"None of my proceeds go to charity.
"
25030,"But look, Chandler...
"
25031,"...right now no one has
"
25032,"a lower opinion of you than I do.
"
25033,"But I totally believe you can do this.
"
25034,"I want to. I love her so much,
"
25035,"but I'm afraid...
"
25036,"It's too huge.
"
25037,"You're right. It is huge.
"
25038,"So let's take it
"
25039,"just a little bit at a time.
"
25040,"Forget getting married for a sec.
"
25041,"Can you just come home
"
25042,"and take a shower?
"
25043,"That's not scary, right?
"
25044,"Depends on what you mean by ""we. ""
"
25045,"The nights are the hardest.
"
25046,"But then the day comes...
"
25047,"...and that's every bit
"
25048,"as hard as the night.
"
25049,"- Then the night comes...
"
25050,"- Days and nights are hard, I get it!
"
25051,"I have to start getting ready.
"
25052,"I'm getting married today.
"
25053,"I know. At dusk.
"
25054,"That's such a hard time for me.
"
25055,"I'm gonna put makeup on.
"
25056,"We have to be there in an hour.
"
25057,"- Wait!
"
25058,"- What?
"
25059,"Let's go to lunch!
"
25060,"I can't go to lunch!
"
25061,"Right.
"
25062,"Oh, good God, I've fallen down.
"
25063,"What's going on?
"
25064,"All right, honey, listen.
"
25065,"When I tell you what I'm
"
25066,"about to tell you, remember...
"
25067,"...that we're all here for you,
"
25068,"and we love you.
"
25069,"Okay, you're really freaking me out.
"
25070,"We can't find Chandler...
"
25071,"His vest.
"
25072,"We can't find Chandler's vest.
"
25073,"How can that be?
"
25074,"Wait, are you serious?
"
25075,"Found the vest.
"
25076,"We'll have to keep an eye on it,
"
25077,"make sure we don't lose it again.
"
25078,"Oh, wow! Okay, don't
"
25079,"scare me like that, okay?
"
25080,"For a minute, I was like,
"
25081,"""Oh, my God! The worst has happened! ""
"
25082,"So you two were married, huh?
"
25083,"What happened, you just drift apart?
"
25084,"Here comes the bride.
"
25085,"Oh, my God, Monica!
"
25086,"I want to wear this every day.
"
25087,"You look so beautiful.
"
25088,"I'm so happy for me.
"
25089,"- Hello?
"
25090,"- Did Chandler show up yet?
"
25091,"- We got him back. Everything's fine.
"
25092,"- Damn it!
"
25093,"- Where are you?
"
25094,"- I'm still on the set.
"
25095,"The wedding is in less than an hour.
"
25096,"I'm sorry. The guy's drunk.
"
25097,"They won't let me go until we get it.
"
25098,"Oh, my God. I'm gonna
"
25099,"have to find another minister.
"
25100,"No, I'm the minister!
"
25101,"Put them both on the phone
"
25102,"and I'll marry them right now.
"
25103,"Joey, I have to go.
"
25104,"Don't hang up on me! I'll marry you
"
25105,"and me right now! I have the power!
"
25106,"There you go! You put on a tuxedo!
"
25107,"That wasn't scary, was it?
"
25108,"No.
"
25109,"I'm telling you,
"
25110,"just a little bit at a time.
"
25111,"Okay. What's the next little bit?
"
25112,"Getting married.
"
25113,"You can do that too.
"
25114,"Just like you've done everything else.
"
25115,"Yeah, you're right. I can do that.
"
25116,"- Excuse me for a minute.
"
25117,"- Where you going?
"
25118,"I'm not gonna run away.
"
25119,"I just want some fresh air.
"
25120,"- Okay.
"
25121,"- Okay.
"
25122,"Oh, fresh air!
"
25123,"- Cover for me.
"
25124,"- Maybe you overreacted. You do that.
"
25125,"We gotta do something.
"
25126,"Joey won't make it, so I'll
"
25127,"look around for other weddings.
"
25128,"Don't tell them Monica's pregnant,
"
25129,"because they frown on that.
"
25130,"Okay.
"
25131,"Anastassakis Papasifakis Wedding.
"
25132,"Excellent.
"
25133,"Congratulations.
"
25134,"Hi! Oh, great hat.
"
25135,"I need you to perform another wedding.
"
25136,"Can you do that?
"
25137,"I don't know.
"
25138,"Are they Greek Orthodox?
"
25139,"Yeah. Yeah.
"
25140,"They're my friends,
"
25141,"Monica Stephanopolis.
"
25142,"And Chandler Acidophilus.
"
25143,"Has anyone seen Chandler?
"
25144,"- I thought he was with you.
"
25145,"- He was with me.
"
25146,"We're playing a game. Hide-and-seek.
"
25147,"You can't ask us, son.
"
25148,"That's cheating.
"
25149,"You're right.
"
25150,"Thanks for keeping me honest, Dad.
"
25151,"He can't come here and see
"
25152,"the bride in her wedding dress.
"
25153,"When we got married,
"
25154,"I saw the groom in the wedding dress.
"
25155,"That was after the wedding.
"
25156,"It's not bad luck then.
"
25157,"Honey, it isn't good luck.
"
25158,"Oh, my God! Monica.
"
25159,"I know!
"
25160,"- How's Chandler doing?
"
25161,"- Great.
"
25162,"He's doing great.
"
25163,"Don't you worry about Chandler.
"
25164,"- Phoebe, can I see you for a second?
"
25165,"- Yeah.
"
25166,"- What's going on?
"
25167,"- Chandler's gone again.
"
25168,"Why would you play hide-and-seek with
"
25169,"someone you know is a flight risk?
"
25170,"Aaron, you gotta let me go.
"
25171,"The guy's hammered.
"
25172,"I'm sorry. As long as he's here
"
25173,"and conscious, we're still shooting.
"
25174,"You wouldn't happen to have
"
25175,"a very big fork?
"
25176,"So, I just talked to the director.
"
25177,"That's it. We're done for the day.
"
25178,"We finished the scene?
"
25179,"- You were wonderful.
"
25180,"- As were you.
"
25181,"So I got your car.
"
25182,"It's right outside.
"
25183,"Thank you. You're welcome.
"
25184,"No, we gotta go. Come on.
"
25185,"Here we go.
"
25186,"Is that my ass?
"
25187,"- There he is!
"
25188,"- What?
"
25189,"You won't get away this time!
"
25190,"Unless you want
"
25191,"that ass-kicking we talked about!
"
25192,"Ross!
"
25193,"I'm serious! You're not
"
25194,"walking out on my sister!
"
25195,"That's right. I'm not.
"
25196,"- Then where have you been?
"
25197,"- I know about Monica.
"
25198,"- You know?
"
25199,"- What?
"
25200,"- I heard you and Rachel talking.
"
25201,"- About what?
"
25202,"You don't know?
"
25203,"If somebody doesn't tell me
"
25204,"right now... .
"
25205,"What, you'll ""hi-yah""?
"
25206,"Monica's pregnant.
"
25207,"Oh, my God.
"
25208,"Oh, my God.
"
25209,"And you're not freaking out?
"
25210,"I was. Then I went to the
"
25211,"gift shop for cigarettes.
"
25212,"- Cigarettes?
"
25213,"- Big picture, please!
"
25214,"So I was in the gift shop,
"
25215,"that's when I saw this... .
"
25216,"And I thought anything that can
"
25217,"fit into this can't be scary.
"
25218,"You obviously
"
25219,"didn't see Chuckie III. 
"
25220,"But come on, look at how cute
"
25221,"and small this is.
"
25222,"So I got it to give Monica,
"
25223,"so she'd know I was okay.
"
25224,"Dude.
"
25225,"Way to go, son.
"
25226,"I knew you'd find him.
"
25227,"Our little boy is getting married.
"
25228,"Look at you, so handsome.
"
25229,"You look beautiful, Mom.
"
25230,"You look beautiful too, Dad.
"
25231,"I love you both.
"
25232,"I'm so glad you're here.
"
25233,"Are you Chandler?
"
25234,"Are you Joey?
"
25235,"- This is nice.
"
25236,"- What?
"
25237,"I've never walked down the aisle
"
25238,"knowing it can't end in divorce.
"
25239,"I wish your grandmother
"
25240,"had lived to see this.
"
25241,"- She's right there.
"
25242,"- Not that old crone. My mother.
"
25243,"Congratulations, darling.
"
25244,"We love you, sweetheart.
"
25245,"You look beautiful.
"
25246,"- Is this new?
"
25247,"- Not now.
"
25248,"- Who's this?
"
25249,"- I'm Father Karabasos.
"
25250,"He's Greek Orthodox.
"
25251,"As are you.
"
25252,"Let us begin.
"
25253,"Dearly beloved...
"
25254,"That's my line!
"
25255,"I can take it from here. Thanks.
"
25256,"Dearly beloved,
"
25257,"I'm sorry I'm a little late.
"
25258,"You may be confused by this now...
"
25259,"...but you won't be
"
25260,"Memorial Day weekend, 2002.
"
25261,"Let's get started before
"
25262,"the groom takes off again.
"
25263,"We are gathered here today...
"
25264,"...to join this man...
"
25265,"...and this woman
"
25266,"in the bonds of holy matrimony.
"
25267,"I've known Monica and Chandler
"
25268,"for a long time, and I can't...
"
25269,"...imagine two people more
"
25270,"perfect for each other.
"
25271,"And now, as I've left my notes
"
25272,"in my dressing room...
"
25273,"...we shall proceed
"
25274,"to the vows. Monica?
"
25275,"- He took off?
"
25276,"- Go on. Go on.
"
25277,"Chandler, for so long...
"
25278,"...I wondered if I would ever
"
25279,"find my prince.
"
25280,"My soul mate.
"
25281,"Then three years ago,
"
25282,"at another wedding...
"
25283,"...I turned to a friend for comfort.
"
25284,"And instead, I found everything that
"
25285,"I'd been looking for my whole life.
"
25286,"And now...
"
25287,"...here we are...
"
25288,"...with our future before us.
"
25289,"And I only want to spend it with you.
"
25290,"My prince. My soul mate.
"
25291,"My friend.
"
25292,"Unless you don't want to.
"
25293,"You go.
"
25294,"Chandler?
"
25295,"No, that's okay.
"
25296,"I thought this would be the most
"
25297,"difficult thing I ever had to do.
"
25298,"But when I saw you walking down that
"
25299,"aisle, I realized it's simple.
"
25300,"I love you.
"
25301,"Any surprises that come our way, it's
"
25302,"okay, because I will always love you.
"
25303,"You are the person I was meant
"
25304,"to spend the rest of my life with.
"
25305,"You want to know if I'm sure?
"
25306,"You may now kiss the bride.
"
25307,"I guess by the powers vested in me
"
25308,"by the State of New York...
"
25309,"...and the Internet guys...
"
25310,"...I now pronounce you
"
25311,"husband and wife.
"
25312,"Oh, wait. Do you take each other?
"
25313,"- I do.
"
25314,"- I do.
"
25315,"Yeah, you do!
"
25316,"Rings?
"
25317,"Oh, crap.
"
25318,"Let's do the rings.
"
25319,"We good? Yeah? Good?
"
25320,"Once again...
"
25321,"...I pronounce you husband and wife.
"
25322,"Now kiss her again.
"
25323,"I love you.
"
25324,"And I know about the baby.
"
25325,"- What baby?
"
25326,"- Our baby.
"
25327,"We have a baby?
"
25328,"Phoebe found your pregnancy test.
"
25329,"I didn't take a pregnancy test.
"
25330,"Then who did?
"
25331,"Look at them.
"
25332,"And they're gonna have a baby.

"
25337,"Joey? Are you in there?
"
25338,"- That's Rachel.
"
25339,"- You have to talk to her.
"
25340,"I can't. Not after the other night.
"
25341,"It's too weird.
"
25342,"Don't tell her I'm here.
"
25343,"Don't eat that!
"
25344,"- Hey!
"
25345,"- Hey, Rachel.
"
25346,"Is Joey here?
"
25347,"- I don't see him. You?
"
25348,"- No.
"
25349,"Maybe he's in the sugar bowl.
"
25350,"Joey? Nope.
"
25351,"Well, at least you make
"
25352,"each other laugh.
"
25353,"- What's up?
"
25354,"- I haven't seen him since he said...
"
25355,"...how he, you know...
"
25356,"I don't know,
"
25357,"I think he's avoiding me.
"
25358,"Why is that bagel on the floor?
"
25359,"- We were playing a game.
"
25360,"- Was Chandler naked?
"
25361,"Sort of like a ring-toss
"
25362,"kind of situation?
"
25363,"- Sure!
"
25364,"- What? No! No!
"
25365,"All right, listen. If you see Joey,
"
25366,"will you just tell him that...?
"
25367,"Tell him I miss him.
"
25368,"- Okay. Did you hear that?
"
25369,"- Yeah. That naked bagel game?
"
25370,"Dude, I don't know. That's a pretty
"
25371,"small hole.
"
25372,"- You've gotta talk to her.
"
25373,"- I can't.
"
25374,"You guys don't know what it's like
"
25375,"to get shot down.
"
25376,"I don't know what that's like?
"
25377,"Until I was 25, I thought the response
"
25378,"to ""I love you"" was ""Oh, crap.""
"
25379,"No rejection?
"
25380,"I got shot down at fat camp.
"
25381,"Boy, kids are mean
"
25382,"when they're hungry.
"
25383,"So, what do I do?
"
25384,"It's Rachel.
"
25385,"You're gonna never talk to her again?
"
25386,"It's weird and it's awkward,
"
25387,"but you gotta at least try.
"
25388,"Yeah, okay.
"
25389,"I forgot this was on your...
"
25390,"We didn't play it!
"
25391,"The One With the Tea Leaves
"
25392,"I'll look at your tea leaves
"
25393,"and tell your fortune.
"
25394,"- You read tea leaves?
"
25395,"- I've done it for years.
"
25396,"I actually stopped
"
25397,"because I was so accurate.
"
25398,"And one of the great joys
"
25399,"of life...
"
25400,"...is its wondrous unpredictability,
"
25401,"you know?
"
25402,"And also,
"
25403,"tea tends to give me the trots.
"
25404,"- Okay. I'm done. Read mine.
"
25405,"- Okay.
"
25406,"I see a ladder.
"
25407,"Which can mean either a promotion
"
25408,"or a violent death.
"
25409,"I'm the head chef.
"
25410,"I can't get promoted.
"
25411,"Who's next?
"
25412,"I'm done. Do mine.
"
25413,"Okay.
"
25414,"Oh! Okay, I see a circle.
"
25415,"Which can either mean
"
25416,"you're having a baby...
"
25417,"...or you'll make
"
25418,"a scientific discovery!
"
25419,"Well, I have been spending
"
25420,"a lot of time in the lab.
"
25421,"- What does yours say, Pheebs?
"
25422,"- All right.
"
25423,"Wow! Yay!
"
25424,"Oh, I'm gonna meet a guy!
"
25425,"And really soon!
"
25426,"He's gonna be the man of my dreams.
"
25427,"Probably not the guy
"
25428,"I had a dream about last night.
"
25429,"Has anyone seen my shirt?
"
25430,"It's a button-down, like
"
25431,"a faded salmon color?
"
25432,"You mean your pink shirt?
"
25433,"Faded salmon color?
"
25434,"No, I haven't seen your pink shirt.
"
25435,"I must have left it at Mona's.
"
25436,"I knew it!
"
25437,"I'm sure you can get another one
"
25438,"at Ann Taylor's.
"
25439,"That's my favorite shirt.
"
25440,"I love it.
"
25441,"Ask Mona to give it back.
"
25442,"I don't know. I could.
"
25443,"We didn't really end things
"
25444,"on good terms.
"
25445,"If I went, I'd be ignoring the
"
25446,"one thing she asked me to do...
"
25447,"...jump up my own ass and die.
"
25448,"Oh, wait a second, you guys?
"
25449,"I've been seeing that guy
"
25450,"everywhere I go.
"
25451,"We take the same bus,
"
25452,"go to the same bookstore.
"
25453,"Maybe he's the tea guy.
"
25454,"Did you see that?
"
25455,"He totally checked you out!
"
25456,"And he is so cute!
"
25457,"Mine is a picture of the Village
"
25458,"People. What's that mean?
"
25459,"Hi.
"
25460,"Hey.
"
25461,"- Hi.
"
25462,"- Hi.
"
25463,"Tea gives Phoebe the trots!
"
25464,"I thought Joey and I
"
25465,"would be okay...
"
25466,"...but we don't know
"
25467,"how to be together.
"
25468,"- It's tough, but things will improve.
"
25469,"- How do you know?
"
25470,"What if it gets worse and worse...
"
25471,"...to the point where we
"
25472,"can't be in the same room?
"
25473,"I'm not great at the advice.
"
25474,"Can I interest you
"
25475,"in a sarcastic comment?
"
25476,"Some cheese?
"
25477,"Honey, why is the Bruce Springsteen CD
"
25478,"in the Cat Stevens case?
"
25479,"If I can't find the right case,
"
25480,"I use the nearest one.
"
25481,"- Where is the Cat Stevens CD?
"
25482,"- The James Taylor case.
"
25483,"- Where is that CD?
"
25484,"- I'll save you time.
"
25485,"Two hundred CDs,
"
25486,"not one of them in the right case.
"
25487,"Okay. No need to panic.
"
25488,"Deep breaths, everyone.
"
25489,"We'll just have to put the CDs
"
25490,"in their right cases.
"
25491,"If we do that, we should
"
25492,"come up with some kind of order.
"
25493,"We have to talk this through.
"
25494,"Oh, my God, you have such
"
25495,"problems! I feel so terrible for you!
"
25496,"All right. Okay, I'm sorry.
"
25497,"You're both focusing on
"
25498,"this uncomfortable thing.
"
25499,"Change the subject.
"
25500,"Get him talking about something else.
"
25501,"Yeah, that makes sense.
"
25502,"Maybe you need his advice
"
25503,"on a work problem...
"
25504,"- I could do that.
"
25505,"- Good.
"
25506,"The Miami Vice soundtrack?
"
25507,"Really?
"
25508,"They were just giving those away
"
25509,"at the store.
"
25510,"In exchange for money.
"
25511,"Hey.
"
25512,"I really don't know what to tell you.
"
25513,"Maybe Joey could help you out
"
25514,"with your big work problem.
"
25515,"- What?
"
25516,"- Yeah, Joey, she's...
"
25517,"Rachel's got this big work problem.
"
25518,"It is a head-scratcher.
"
25519,"Know what? If we're gonna make dinner,
"
25520,"we're gonna have to leave.
"
25521,"So you have a big work problem?
"
25522,"Yeah. It's, uh...
"
25523,"Yeah, it's, uh...
"
25524,"You know, it's nothing.
"
25525,"Okay.
"
25526,"So I think I'm gonna take off.
"
25527,"No, wait, Joey, it is.
"
25528,"It's something. It's...
"
25529,"It's my boss.
"
25530,"- Yeah?
"
25531,"- Yeah. And, uh...
"
25532,"And my baby.
"
25533,"My boss wants to buy my baby.
"
25534,"What? Oh, my God!
"
25535,"I know, I told you,
"
25536,"it's a really big problem!
"
25537,"- He wants to buy your baby?
"
25538,"- Can you believe that?
"
25539,"- That's crazy.
"
25540,"- That's what I told him!
"
25541,"- How did this even happen?
"
25542,"- Well, I'll tell you.
"
25543,"See, my boss and his wife,
"
25544,"they can't have children, so...
"
25545,"And then when we were
"
25546,"at the Christmas party...
"
25547,"...he got drunk and said to me,
"
25548,"""Rachel, I want to buy your baby.""
"
25549,"When you said it was a problem
"
25550,"about your boss and the baby...
"
25551,"...I figured it was
"
25552,"about maternity leave.
"
25553,"Oh. Yeah.
"
25554,"Yeah, that would have been
"
25555,"a much simpler problem.
"
25556,"- Oh, hello.
"
25557,"- Oh, it's you. I see you everywhere.
"
25558,"I'm Jim. Jim Nelson.
"
25559,"Hi, Jim-Jim Nelson.
"
25560,"I'm Phoebe-Phoebe Buffay.
"
25561,"- We've seen each other a lot lately.
"
25562,"- Yes.
"
25563,"Maybe we'll see each other at
"
25564,"dinner tomorrow. Around 8:00?
"
25565,"Well, maybe we will.
"
25566,"Mona?
"
25567,"Okay, if I were a salmon shirt,
"
25568,"where would I be?
"
25569,"I am so sorry I spilled wine
"
25570,"all over your shirt.
"
25571,"- It's okay.
"
25572,"- No, it's still wet.
"
25573,"Let me get it out before it sets.
"
25574,"I have something you could wear.
"
25575,"Here.
"
25576,"I don't know if I want to wear
"
25577,"a woman's shirt.
"
25578,"- That's a man's shirt.
"
25579,"- Awfully pink.
"
25580,"It's not pink!
"
25581,"Honey, we are so meant
"
25582,"to be together.
"
25583,"- We both have the Annie soundtrack.
"
25584,"- Honey, both yours.
"
25585,"Hey, great advice on that Joey thing.
"
25586,"- The work problem?
"
25587,"- It was perfect.
"
25588,"It felt like he was my friend.
"
25589,"- What problem did you say you have?
"
25590,"- Oh, that's not important.
"
25591,"The point is,
"
25592,"I think everything's gonna be okay.
"
25593,"May I help you?
"
25594,"You think you can just buy
"
25595,"my friend's baby?
"
25596,"Isn't it funny how we kept meeting?
"
25597,"It's as if someone wants us together.
"
25598,"Someone does. Me.
"
25599,"Witty banter. Well done. Good.
"
25600,"- Tell me a little bit about yourself.
"
25601,"- Okay. I'm a masseuse.
"
25602,"- And I used to work at this place...
"
25603,"- Do you like to party?
"
25604,"I like parties.
"
25605,"You're wild, aren't you?
"
25606,"- Yeah, I guess. A little.
"
25607,"- Ain't no thing. I'm wild too.
"
25608,"So anyway...
"
25609,"...I've lived in New York,
"
25610,"somewhat wildly, I guess...
"
25611,"...for, well, since I was 14.
"
25612,"I'm sorry. I'm staring.
"
25613,"It's just that you have
"
25614,"the most beautiful eyes.
"
25615,"Oh, stop it.
"
25616,"And your breasts!
"
25617,"Okay.
"
25618,"Look, you're coming on
"
25619,"a little strong.
"
25620,"I'll give you the benefit
"
25621,"of the doubt.
"
25622,"The universe wants us
"
25623,"to be together.
"
25624,"Why don't we start over?
"
25625,"You can tell me about yourself.
"
25626,"- All right.
"
25627,"- Okay.
"
25628,"I write erotic novels...
"
25629,"...for children.
"
25630,"- What?
"
25631,"- They're wildly unpopular.
"
25632,"Oh, my God!
"
25633,"Also, you might like to know
"
25634,"I have a Ph.D.
"
25635,"- Wow! You do?
"
25636,"- Yep. A pretty huge...
"
25637,"All right.
"
25638,"- Hey.
"
25639,"- Joey, honey, listen.
"
25640,"Thanks for talking to me yesterday.
"
25641,"It meant a lot.
"
25642,"Not a problem.
"
25643,"Just so you know...
"
25644,"...that guy won't be bothering
"
25645,"you about that baby thing anymore.
"
25646,"- What?
"
25647,"- Let's just say I took care of it.
"
25648,"Let's say more.
"
25649,"Don't worry.
"
25650,"I told him, very nicely:
"
25651,"""You don't go buying people's babies!
"
25652,"So back off!""
"
25653,"- What?
"
25654,"- What?
"
25655,"No, no, no!
"
25656,"He doesn't want to buy my baby!
"
25657,"I made that up!
"
25658,"What? Why?
"
25659,"So we would have something
"
25660,"to talk about!
"
25661,"And you couldn't think
"
25662,"of anything else?
"
25663,"You said your boss
"
25664,"wants to buy your baby?
"
25665,"You yelled at my boss!
"
25666,"I'll lose my job! What am I gonna do?
"
25667,"You could always sell your baby.
"
25668,"I can't believe you brought
"
25669,"my boss into it! I'll be fired!
"
25670,"- You lied to me!
"
25671,"- Well, she told me to!
"
25672,"Chandler has two copies of Annie!
"
25673,"Oh, my God!
"
25674,"- Ross!
"
25675,"- Hello!
"
25676,"What are you doing?
"
25677,"Not touching myself, if that makes
"
25678,"anyone less uncomfortable.
"
25679,"Morning. You wanted to see me?
"
25680,"Please, come in. Have a seat.
"
25681,"- Look, Mr. Zelner...
"
25682,"- It's best I speak first.
"
25683,"Yeah.
"
25684,"Lee from human resources is here
"
25685,"as a witness to our conversation.
"
25686,"Oh, God.
"
25687,"If I in any way implied
"
25688,"that I wanted to buy your baby...
"
25689,"...I am sorry. Okay?
"
25690,"Last week, when I asked you
"
25691,"when your due date was...
"
25692,"...I certainly did not mean that
"
25693,"I felt that I was ""due"" your baby.
"
25694,"I want to be very clear...
"
25695,"...that I understand
"
25696,"that it's your baby...
"
25697,"...and it is not mine to purchase.
"
25698,"Well, as long as we are clear
"
25699,"about that.
"
25700,"There it is.
"
25701,"- Not your regular cleaners.
"
25702,"- I know.
"
25703,"That creep goes there.
"
25704,"I had to find a new one.
"
25705,"I have to find a new bank,
"
25706,"adult bookstore, grocery store...
"
25707,"- What?
"
25708,"- A new grocery store.
"
25709,"The universe said I'd meet a nice guy.
"
25710,"I got that?
"
25711,"When I get up there,
"
25712,"I'm gonna kick some ass.
"
25713,"You'll meet someone. If I can meet
"
25714,"a great guy, so can you.
"
25715,"Yeah, we both can. And we both will.
"
25716,"- You didn't have to come in.
"
25717,"- You kidding?
"
25718,"This is where they get out stains.
"
25719,"This is like Disneyland for me.
"
25720,"I'm gonna be over here watching
"
25721,"the dance of the clean shirts.
"
25722,"Excuse me.
"
25723,"I think you dropped...
"
25724,"- Wow!
"
25725,"- What?
"
25726,"Sorry.
"
25727,"You're just so incredibly beautiful.
"
25728,"Well, I'm sorry about that too.
"
25729,"But what are you gonna do?
"
25730,"Don't think I'm crazy,
"
25731,"but I was meant to pick this up.
"
25732,"- Do you believe in that kind of thing?
"
25733,"- A little.
"
25734,"Now you're talking.
"
25735,"- Want to go for coffee?
"
25736,"- I'd love to. Let me tell my friend.
"
25737,"An ink stain!
"
25738,"Can I watch how you get this out?
"
25739,"She must have left.
"
25740,"- So? What happened?
"
25741,"- It's all gonna be okay.
"
25742,"They're so happy I'm not suing, I got
"
25743,"an extra month paid maternity leave.
"
25744,"So long as I understand the money
"
25745,"should not be construed...
"
25746,"...as a down payment on this
"
25747,"or any other child.
"
25748,"Ralph Lauren is going
"
25749,"out of their way...
"
25750,"...to show they're not
"
25751,"in the baby-buying business.
"
25752,"- Give us a minute?
"
25753,"- Kicking me out of my living room?
"
25754,"Yeah.
"
25755,"I'll be in there.
"
25756,"I'm sorry I lied to you.
"
25757,"I was just trying to make things...
"
25758,"I know. I know.
"
25759,"It kind of worked.
"
25760,"I don't know about you,
"
25761,"but I haven't thought about our thing.
"
25762,"Yeah, you're right.
"
25763,"Yeah. It's kind of been
"
25764,"like ""us"" again, a little bit.
"
25765,"- Yeah, I know. I've missed that.
"
25766,"- Me too.
"
25767,"I haven't thought about
"
25768,"how I put myself out there...
"
25769,"...and said that stuff.
"
25770,"How you didn't feel the same...
"
25771,"...and how it was really awkward.
"
25772,"My gynecologist tried to kill me.
"
25773,"Item J437-A.
"
25774,"Color: winterberry.
"
25775,"Hi, listen.
"
25776,"Come here. Come...
"
25777,"I'm so, so sorry about yesterday.
"
25778,"Listen, you don't have to apologize.
"
25779,"I understand why you were there.
"
25780,"- You do?
"
25781,"- Yeah. You still have feelings for me.
"
25782,"To be honest,
"
25783,"I still have feelings for you.
"
25784,"I wish we could work out,
"
25785,"but we can't.
"
25786,"It's too complicated with you and
"
25787,"Rachel and the baby. I just...
"
25788,"It just wasn't meant to be.
"
25789,"Oh, God. You're right.
"
25790,"Ross, we have to be strong.
"
25791,"Okay, I'm gonna go.
"
25792,"Can I? To remember you?
"
25793,"No.

"
25798,"Okay, Ross.
"
25799,"I realize that you didn't expect
"
25800,"to walk in and see that, but...
"
25801,"- Let me explain, okay?
"
25802,"- We weren't doing anything!
"
25803,"Rach, he just saw us.
"
25804,"But what you saw,
"
25805,"that is the extent of it, okay? One kiss.
"
25806,"- That's a lie! We also kissed in Barbados.
"
25807,"- Dude, chill!
"
25808,"Okay, we also kissed in Barbados...
"
25809,"...but we didn't plan it.
"
25810,"The only reason that that happened...
"
25811,"...was because I saw you kiss Charlie.
"
25812,"Yeah, you started it!
"
25813,"I have got to chill.
"
25814,"Look, we probably should have talked to
"
25815,"you about this before it ever happened.
"
25816,"- But...
"
25817,"- Oh, we feel so terrible about this, Ross.
"
25818,"Yeah. But it did happen.
"
25819,"So...
"
25820,"Ross?
"
25821,"Ross?
"
25822,"Can we just close the door?
"
25823,"The One Where Ross Is Fine
"
25824,"Ross, say something.
"
25825,"Anything.
"
25826,"So you two are...?
"
25827,"- Yeah.
"
25828,"- Yeah.
"
25829,"And have you had...?
"
25830,"- No. No, no, no.
"
25831,"- No. No.
"
25832,"But if I hadn't walked in here,
"
25833,"would you...?
"
25834,"Probably...
"
25835,"No. No.
"
25836,"Ross, this is not how we wanted you
"
25837,"to find out about this.
"
25838,"You have every right
"
25839,"to go nuts.
"
25840,"I'm not going nuts.
"
25841,"Do you see me going nuts?
"
25842,"No, but you know what I mean.
"
25843,"If you two are happy...
"
25844,"...then I'm happy for you.
"
25845,"I'm fine.
"
25846,"- Really?
"
25847,"- Absolutely.
"
25848,"I'm fine.
"
25849,"Totally fine.
"
25850,"I don't know why it's coming out
"
25851,"all loud and squeaky...
"
25852,"...because, really, I'm fine.
"
25853,"I'm not saying I wasn't a little surprised
"
25854,"to see you guys kissing.
"
25855,"I mean, at first I was like:
"
25856,"But now that I've had time
"
25857,"to absorb it...
"
25858,"Loving this.
"
25859,"- Ross...
"
25860,"- It's all working out.
"
25861,"Me and Charlie.
"
25862,"And you two.
"
25863,"- You know what we should do?
"
25864,"- Calm ourselves?
"
25865,"No.
"
25866,"We should all have dinner.
"
25867,"Yes, we'll do it tomorrow night.
"
25868,"I'll cook!
"
25869,"Look, don't you think
"
25870,"that would be a little weird?
"
25871,"Weird? What? What's weird?
"
25872,"The only thing weird would be
"
25873,"if someone didn't like Mexican food...
"
25874,"...because I'm making fajitas!
"
25875,"I do like fajitas.
"
25876,"God, this adoption stuff
"
25877,"is so overwhelming.
"
25878,"There's inter-country adoption,
"
25879,"dependency adoption.
"
25880,"There's so many ways to go, and this is,
"
25881,"like, the biggest decision of our lives.
"
25882,"There's a hair in my coffee.
"
25883,"Hey, guys.
"
25884,"Have you seen Frank Jr.?
"
25885,"He's meeting me here with the triplets.
"
25886,"It's funny,
"
25887,"every time you say ""triplets""...
"
25888,"...I think of three hot,
"
25889,"blond 19-year-olds.
"
25890,"That's sweet.
"
25891,"Drink your hair.
"
25892,"Hey, what's all this stuff?
"
25893,"They're brochures
"
25894,"from different adoption agencies.
"
25895,"Babies! Oh, this one is so cute.
"
25896,"Get this one.
"
25897,"That's not really how it works.
"
25898,"- Oh, how does it work?
"
25899,"- I don't know!
"
25900,"If you're having a hard time,
"
25901,"you should talk to my friends...
"
25902,"...Bill and Colleen. They adopted
"
25903,"a kid. I'm sure they'd help you.
"
25904,"Thanks, that would be great.
"
25905,"Hey, honey,
"
25906,"wouldn't that be great?
"
25907,"All right, all right.
"
25908,"Remember what we talked about.
"
25909,"When we're in a public place,
"
25910,"there are certain rules.
"
25911,"That's not what we talked about!
"
25912,"- Hi, Frank.
"
25913,"- Hi.
"
25914,"- Good to see you.
"
25915,"- Good to see you too.
"
25916,"- Hi, Frank.
"
25917,"- Hi. Hey, how you doing?
"
25918,"Oh, my goodness, they've all gotten
"
25919,"so big. Which one is which again?
"
25920,"Well, that's Frank Jr. Jr...
"
25921,"...pulling the tampons out
"
25922,"of the lady's purse.
"
25923,"And that's Chandler
"
25924,"climbing on Chandler.
"
25925,"That's Leslie throwing bagels at him.
"
25926,"""Willing to adopt triplets?"" No.
"
25927,"Can I just say, I know we're doing this
"
25928,"for Ross and that's cool.
"
25929,"But if it was up to me, this is not what
"
25930,"we'd be doing on our first date.
"
25931,"Well, what would we be doing?
"
25932,"I'd take you out
"
25933,"for a romantic night.
"
25934,"Some champagne, fancy dinner,
"
25935,"feel you up on the carriage ride home.
"
25936,"Feel me up?
"
25937,"In a carriage.
"
25938,"- Hey, Charlie!
"
25939,"- Hi.
"
25940,"- Hi.
"
25941,"- Hey.
"
25942,"So...
"
25943,"...dreading this?
"
25944,"- Oh, you bet.
"
25945,"So did you bring
"
25946,"a little something for Ross?
"
25947,"Actually, it's some stuff you left
"
25948,"at my apartment.
"
25949,"Well, thanks.
"
25950,"And you can just give me
"
25951,"my stuff whenever you want.
"
25952,"Yeah, I didn't throw any of that out.
"
25953,"I thought I heard voices.
"
25954,"Hi, Charlie.
"
25955,"Hey, Joey.
"
25956,"And, oh, you're gonna have
"
25957,"to introduce me to your new girlfriend.
"
25958,"I'm just kidding. I know Rachel.
"
25959,"I know...
"
25960,"Come. Please come in.
"
25961,"Come in.
"
25962,"Okay.
"
25963,"Well, we brought you some wine.
"
25964,"That is so thoughtful.
"
25965,"She's a keeper.
"
25966,"- And what did you bring me, huh?
"
25967,"- Actually, that's...
"
25968,"Underwear, a toothbrush...
"
25969,"...and a Van Halen CD.
"
25970,"I can use all these things!
"
25971,"Gosh, Ross, you know,
"
25972,"you seem a little...
"
25973,"What? Fine? Because I am.
"
25974,"Aren't you? Aren't you? Aren't...?
"
25975,"You see?
"
25976,"Who else is fine?
"
25977,"Come on.
"
25978,"Listen. Why don't you try to relax.
"
25979,"Maybe have a drink.
"
25980,"You know what,
"
25981,"that is a very good idea.
"
25982,"I'm gonna go make
"
25983,"a pitcher of margaritas.
"
25984,"Oh, God.
"
25985,"So adorable.
"
25986,"Look at them,
"
25987,"sleeping there like angels.
"
25988,"Yeah, I really cherish
"
25989,"these moments...
"
25990,"...because before you know it,
"
25991,"they're gonna be awake again.
"
25992,"Well, they may be a handful...
"
25993,"...but they're so cute.
"
25994,"- Yeah.
"
25995,"Oh, God, last time I babysat them,
"
25996,"they did the funniest thing.
"
25997,"I haven't slept in four years.
"
25998,"That's a long time.
"
25999,"You just don't know
"
26000,"how hard it is, Phoebe.
"
26001,"There's just so many of them.
"
26002,"You know, two I could handle.
"
26003,"Two's great.
"
26004,"You just hold one in each hand.
"
26005,"What do I do when the third one runs
"
26006,"at me with his bike helmet on?
"
26007,"I got no more hands
"
26008,"to protect my area.
"
26009,"There's three of them, Phoebe.
"
26010,"Three.
"
26011,"Yeah, I know, Frank.
"
26012,"I counted them when they
"
26013,"were coming out of my area.
"
26014,"Sometimes, I think that...
"
26015,"Oh, no, no, no, I can't say it.
"
26016,"It's too horrible. No.
"
26017,"What?
"
26018,"No, no, I can't.
"
26019,"Oh, my God, Frank.
"
26020,"Are you thinking of leaving?
"
26021,"Because I didn't have those triplets
"
26022,"so you could run out on them.
"
26023,"Oh, no, I would never do that.
"
26024,"No. I just...
"
26025,"...was thinking that, you know,
"
26026,"maybe you could take one.
"
26027,"What?
"
26028,"You can't separate them, that's terrible!
"
26029,"Which one?
"
26030,"Thank you so much for seeing us.
"
26031,"Phoebe has told us great things
"
26032,"about you guys.
"
26033,"Please, we're happy to help.
"
26034,"We went through the same thing
"
26035,"when we were adopting.
"
26036,"So a lot of malfunctioning wee-wees
"
26037,"and hoo-hoos in this room, huh?
"
26038,"I mean, you have a lovely home.
"
26039,"We appreciate anything
"
26040,"you can tell us.
"
26041,"Well, actually,
"
26042,"I think this might help.
"
26043,"It's pretty much...
"
26044,"...all the information you need.
"
26045,"- Oh, my God.
"
26046,"Everything is broken into categories,
"
26047,"then cross-referenced.
"
26048,"Then color-coded to correspond
"
26049,"with the forms in the back.
"
26050,"Thank you.
"
26051,"I think I just had a tiny orgasm.
"
26052,"I know the process is frustrating,
"
26053,"but it's so worth it.
"
26054,"Adopting Owen was the best thing
"
26055,"that ever happened to us.
"
26056,"That's great. Can I see the book?
"
26057,"You want me to wash
"
26058,"my hands first, don't you?
"
26059,"Please. It's just so pretty and white.
"
26060,"Bathroom is down the hall to your left.
"
26061,"I would have told him to do it too.
"
26062,"Can I adopt you?
"
26063,"- Hey, you must be Owen.
"
26064,"- Yeah.
"
26065,"I'm Chandler.
"
26066,"Hey, I was in the Scouts too.
"
26067,"- You were?
"
26068,"- In fact, my father was a den mother.
"
26069,"You know how to use a compass?
"
26070,"I have a badge in it.
"
26071,"- You do? That's fantastic.
"
26072,"- You want to see it?
"
26073,"I'd love to, but I gotta get back
"
26074,"to your parents.
"
26075,"They're telling us
"
26076,"about how they adopted you.
"
26077,"What?
"
26078,"What?
"
26079,"I'm adopted?
"
26080,"I got nothing.
"
26081,"Well, that first batch of margaritas
"
26082,"was not so great...
"
26083,"...but this second batch is good.
"
26084,"Well, maybe the next batch,
"
26085,"we could all get some.
"
26086,"Oh, God, this is fun, isn't it?
"
26087,"You know, just the four of us.
"
26088,"Just hanging.
"
26089,"Dude, are you okay?
"
26090,"And when are the fajitas
"
26091,"gonna be ready?
"
26092,"I'm fine, okay? I'm great.
"
26093,"I'm just...
"
26094,"I'm just proud of us.
"
26095,"You know?
"
26096,"There's no weirdness, no tension.
"
26097,"No awareness.
"
26098,"We make a great foursome.
"
26099,"We should do more stuff together.
"
26100,"Let's take a trip!
"
26101,"Okay, where do you think we can go?
"
26102,"My fajitas!
"
26103,"Look, Charlie,
"
26104,"I just want you to know...
"
26105,"...Ross is just having a little trouble
"
26106,"adjusting to the thought of Joey and me.
"
26107,"You know, he normally
"
26108,"doesn't drink like this.
"
26109,"You know what, this is nothing.
"
26110,"My father is a raging alcoholic.
"
26111,"I'm sorry, have I made
"
26112,"this evening uncomfortable?
"
26113,"Fajitas! Be careful!
"
26114,"Very hot plate! Very hot!
"
26115,"Ross, you don't
"
26116,"even have oven mitts on.
"
26117,"That is gonna hurt tomorrow.
"
26118,"Okay, well, this is crazy.
"
26119,"We can't seriously be talking about me
"
26120,"taking one of your kids, can we?
"
26121,"Oh, no, of course we're not.
"
26122,"- That's insane.
"
26123,"- I know.
"
26124,"Alice would never go for it.
"
26125,"She's pretty tired too.
"
26126,"I think we could get her on board.
"
26127,"Well, just for argument's sake,
"
26128,"you know, hypothetically...
"
26129,"...which one
"
26130,"would you be willing to give up?
"
26131,"Frank Jr. Jr.?
"
26132,"You'd be getting a really good one.
"
26133,"I mean, you know,
"
26134,"he's really funny.
"
26135,"Like, the other day,
"
26136,"he made up this joke:
"
26137,"What's green and says,
"
26138,"""Hey, I'm a frog""?
"
26139,"A talking frog.
"
26140,"Oh, no, you can't have him,
"
26141,"he's too funny.
"
26142,"Well, all right, that's fine.
"
26143,"What about Leslie?
"
26144,"Oh, no, no, not Leslie. No.
"
26145,"She's the only one that knows how
"
26146,"to burp the alphabet.
"
26147,"All right, so that leaves Chandler.
"
26148,"No, no, you can't have Chandler.
"
26149,"No, no. She's my little genius.
"
26150,"I got big hopes for her.
"
26151,"She's gonna be a doctor
"
26152,"or a realtor.
"
26153,"Wow, Frank,
"
26154,"I think we just ran out of kids.
"
26155,"Oh, I think you're right.
"
26156,"Oh, wow. Phoebe, I don't think
"
26157,"I can give one of them up.
"
26158,"I mean, you know, they drive me crazy,
"
26159,"but they're my babies.
"
26160,"I'm sorry, Frank,
"
26161,"I didn't realize things were so bad.
"
26162,"You know, I'll help out more.
"
26163,"I can babysit anytime you want.
"
26164,"You name the day and I'll be there.
"
26165,"- How about tomorrow?
"
26166,"- Well, that's not good.
"
26167,"But I can move some stuff around
"
26168,"and I'll be there.
"
26169,"You and Alice just take
"
26170,"the whole day together.
"
26171,"You'd do that for us?
"
26172,"Are you kidding?
"
26173,"That's what sisters are for.
"
26174,"Oh, look at them.
"
26175,"I love you so much.
"
26176,"Oh, crap, don't wake up!
"
26177,"Don't wake up!
"
26178,"- Where are Bill and Colleen?
"
26179,"- Kitchen, getting something to eat.
"
26180,"Can you believe
"
26181,"how nice they are?
"
26182,"We have to leave.
"
26183,"Why?
"
26184,"What did you do in the bathroom?
"
26185,"I didn't get to the bathroom.
"
26186,"I bumped into Owen on the way.
"
26187,"He didn't know he was adopted.
"
26188,"There's a slight chance...
"
26189,"...I may have told him.
"
26190,"Oh, my God, where's my purse?
"
26191,"No, I can replace everything in there.
"
26192,"- Get that binder and let's go!
"
26193,"- Hi.
"
26194,"Some little snacks for everybody.
"
26195,"You don't have to eat the sour worms.
"
26196,"Those are for Owen.
"
26197,"I'll go get him in a second.
"
26198,"By the way, you should know,
"
26199,"we haven't told him he's adopted yet.
"
26200,"But kids are so intuitive.
"
26201,"Don't you think, on some level,
"
26202,"he already knows?
"
26203,"- I'm adopted?
"
26204,"- See? Intuitive.
"
26205,"What? Where did you hear that?
"
26206,"He told me.
"
26207,"And he paid me 50 dollars not to tell.
"
26208,"Which, technically,
"
26209,"now you should give back.
"
26210,"You told him he's adopted?
"
26211,"I'm sorry. You should have
"
26212,"a sign out there or something.
"
26213,"Or at least whisper it to people
"
26214,"when they come in the door.
"
26215,"""Owen doesn't know he's adopted,
"
26216,"and he also thinks Santa is real.""
"
26217,"He isn't?
"
26218,"We have to get out of here, baby.
"
26219,"Everyone, I would like
"
26220,"to make a toast...
"
26221,"...to Rachel and Joey.
"
26222,"And to love.
"
26223,"Ah, love!
"
26224,"L-O-V-E. Love.
"
26225,"L is for ""life.""
"
26226,"And what is life without love?
"
26227,"Oh, my God, are we supposed
"
26228,"to answer?
"
26229,"O is for:
"
26230,"""Oh, wow!""
"
26231,"The V is for this...
"
26232,"...very surprising turn of events...
"
26233,"...which I am still fine with,
"
26234,"by the way.
"
26235,"E...
"
26236,"...is for how...
"
26237,"...extremely normal I find it...
"
26238,"...that you two...
"
26239,"...are together.
"
26240,"And that one day
"
26241,"you might get married...
"
26242,"...and have children of your own.
"
26243,"- Dude, are you okay?
"
26244,"- Totally.
"
26245,"Ross, you don't seem okay.
"
26246,"I'm sorry, it must be
"
26247,"the pressure of entertaining.
"
26248,"I think everyone would
"
26249,"feel better if we had some flan.
"
26250,"Wait, Ross. Ross, l...
"
26251,"I have to take off.
"
26252,"- No!
"
26253,"- I'm sorry.
"
26254,"I have an early class in the morning.
"
26255,"But this has been lovely.
"
26256,"Wasn't it? And you thought it
"
26257,"would be awkward with Joey.
"
26258,"And that you never
"
26259,"really liked Rachel.
"
26260,"You are on fire!
"
26261,"I'll call you in the morning, okay?
"
26262,"- Okay.
"
26263,"- All right.
"
26264,"God, Rachel, what Ross just said,
"
26265,"that's just...
"
26266,"That's okay.
"
26267,"Girls tend not to like me.
"
26268,"Fine.
"
26269,"Okay. I guess it's just flan for three.
"
26270,"Hey, that rhymes.
"
26271,"You know what, Ross,
"
26272,"I think we're gonna take off too.
"
26273,"Of course. God, I'm so stupid.
"
26274,"You guys are a couple now.
"
26275,"I mean, you probably
"
26276,"just want to be alone.
"
26277,"- No, it's just getting late...
"
26278,"- It's fine. It's totally fine.
"
26279,"I've got plenty of margaritas.
"
26280,"It's all good.
"
26281,"I don't even know what that's for.
"
26282,"You know what?
"
26283,"I think I'm gonna stay here
"
26284,"and make sure he's okay.
"
26285,"- That's probably a good idea.
"
26286,"- I'll see you in the morning.
"
26287,"Okay.
"
26288,"Yeah, you know, Joey, l...
"
26289,"I don't think he's ever
"
26290,"gonna be okay with this.
"
26291,"It doesn't look good, does it?
"
26292,"Morning.
"
26293,"- Here you go.
"
26294,"- Thanks.
"
26295,"- Did you stay here all night?
"
26296,"- Yeah.
"
26297,"So you took off my pants and shoes?
"
26298,"No. No, no.
"
26299,"You actually did that when you
"
26300,"were dancing to the Chicago soundtrack.
"
26301,"Look, Ross...
"
26302,"...about Rachel and I. Listen, you don't
"
26303,"have to worry about that...
"
26304,"...because nothing's gonna happen.
"
26305,"What do you mean?
"
26306,"She and I said from the beginning...
"
26307,"...we weren't gonna do anything
"
26308,"unless you were okay with it.
"
26309,"And clearly...
"
26310,"What are you talking about?
"
26311,"I'm fine.
"
26312,"It's okay, Ross.
"
26313,"You know, I totally understand.
"
26314,"Of course you're not fine. You're...
"
26315,"You're Ross and Rachel.
"
26316,"Yeah, except we're not.
"
26317,"I mean, we haven't been
"
26318,"a couple in, like...
"
26319,"...six years.
"
26320,"My God, is that right?
"
26321,"Has it been that long?
"
26322,"That's what I hear, yeah.
"
26323,"This is crazy.
"
26324,"I mean, six years...
"
26325,"...and because of me,
"
26326,"you guys aren't gonna be together?
"
26327,"Can I ask you something?
"
26328,"Really...
"
26329,"...what is this thing
"
26330,"with you and Rachel?
"
26331,"Come on, you know me.
"
26332,"You know...
"
26333,"Joey.
"
26334,"I'm crazy about her.
"
26335,"And she feels the same way?
"
26336,"I think so.
"
26337,"Well, then...
"
26338,"...maybe it's time
"
26339,"we all moved on.
"
26340,"Yeah, but, Ross, I mean,
"
26341,"you're not okay with it, so...
"
26342,"No, but I want to be.
"
26343,"I will be.
"
26344,"Besides, I'm with Charlie, right?
"
26345,"Oh, my God,
"
26346,"I'm still with Charlie, aren't I?
"
26347,"- She didn't see the dance, did she?
"
26348,"- No, no, no.
"
26349,"No, that was...
"
26350,"That was just for me.
"
26351,"Hey, you...?
"
26352,"You sure about this?
"
26353,"Yeah, I'm sure.
"
26354,"And...
"
26355,"...we're okay?
"
26356,"- Hey, Pheebs.
"
26357,"- Hey.
"
26358,"We just want to give
"
26359,"you a heads up.
"
26360,"Bill and Colleen hate us.
"
26361,"Owen didn't know he's adopted
"
26362,"and Monica told him.
"
26363,"What?
"
26364,"Still, he had to find out sometime.
"
26365,"How would you like it if someone told
"
26366,"the triplets that you gave birth to them?
"
26367,"I'm gonna go tell Emma
"
26368,"she was an accident.

"
26373,"- So you and Rachel tonight, huh?
"
26374,"- Yeah.
"
26375,"Yeah, it's actually
"
26376,"our first official date.
"
26377,"Wow, so tonight may be the night.
"
26378,"You nervous?
"
26379,"No. This is the part
"
26380,"I'm actually good at.
"
26381,"What must it be like not to be
"
26382,"crippled by fear and self-Ioathing?
"
26383,"It's okay.
"
26384,"How can you be so confident?
"
26385,"Well, I know exactly
"
26386,"what I'm gonna do.
"
26387,"- Really? Like, you have a routine?
"
26388,"- No. See, each woman is different.
"
26389,"You have to appreciate
"
26390,"their uniqueness.
"
26391,"- Really?
"
26392,"- No, I do six things.
"
26393,"First, I look deep into her eyes,
"
26394,"then I kiss her.
"
26395,"Next, I take my hand
"
26396,"and I softly graze her thigh.
"
26397,"You mean like this?
"
26398,"No, not like that. No, no.
"
26399,"No, like this:
"
26400,"I see what you mean.
"
26401,"That's quite nice.
"
26402,"- More foosball?
"
26403,"- And beer.
"
26404,"The One With Ross's Tan
"
26405,"- Hey.
"
26406,"- Hey.
"
26407,"Hey, sweetie.
"
26408,"Hey, stop staring at my wife's legs.
"
26409,"No, no. Stop staring
"
26410,"at your sister's legs.
"
26411,"I'm sorry, it's just...
"
26412,"How'd you get so tan?
"
26413,"She went to one of those
"
26414,"spray-on tan places.
"
26415,"You got a spray-on tan?
"
26416,"Chandler gets pedicures!
"
26417,"What? You do?
"
26418,"Like, with the toe separators?
"
26419,"Why? Why?
"
26420,"I can't believe that's sprayed on.
"
26421,"I mean, it looks really good.
"
26422,"I wonder if I should get one.
"
26423,"Sure, then you should get a miniskirt
"
26424,"so you can really show it off.
"
26425,"So do you get colors
"
26426,"or just French tips?
"
26427,"- Here. Here's their card.
"
26428,"- Thanks.
"
26429,"Hey, I know where this place is.
"
26430,"It used to be an X-rated video...
"
26431,"Florist.
"
26432,"- Hey.
"
26433,"- Hey, Pheebs.
"
26434,"You won't believe
"
26435,"who moved back to town.
"
26436,"I know. Amanda.
"
26437,"- She called me too. She's the worst.
"
26438,"- Who's Amanda?
"
26439,"She's this girl who lived in the building
"
26440,"before you did.
"
26441,"Then she moved to England and
"
26442,"picked up this fake British accent.
"
26443,"On the machine, this is her message:
"
26444,"""Monica, darling, it's Amanda calling.""
"
26445,"Are you trying to do a British accent?
"
26446,"Chandler gets pedicures.
"
26447,"Just so I know, how many more
"
26448,"of those can I expect?
"
26449,"Know what Amanda said
"
26450,"when she called me?
"
26451,"""Oh, so sorry to catch you
"
26452,"on your mobile.""
"
26453,"If you didn't wanna get me on my mobile,
"
26454,"then don't call me on my mobile.
"
26455,"And she always brags about
"
26456,"all the famous people she's met.
"
26457,"Oh, I know!
"
26458,"""I slept with Billy Joel.""
"
26459,"All right, who hasn't?
"
26460,"What are we gonna do?
"
26461,"I don't wanna see her.
"
26462,"Let's just cut her out.
"
26463,"- What?
"
26464,"- Cut her out of our lives.
"
26465,"Just ignore her calls
"
26466,"and dodge her till she gets the point.
"
26467,"Well, I guess we could try that.
"
26468,"But it seems so harsh.
"
26469,"- Have you ever done that?
"
26470,"- No. Had it done to me, though.
"
26471,"Feels good.
"
26472,"All right, Mr. Geller, right this way.
"
26473,"So how dark do you wanna be?
"
26474,"We have one, two or three.
"
26475,"Well, I like how you look.
"
26476,"What are you?
"
26477,"- Puerto Rican.
"
26478,"- Two. I think a two.
"
26479,"You'll face the red light.
"
26480,"When the light's on, the spraying's
"
26481,"about to start, so close your eyes.
"
26482,"When the spraying stops,
"
26483,"count to five...
"
26484,"...pat yourself to avoid drip marks,
"
26485,"then turn to get your back. Got it?
"
26486,"Spray, count, pat and turn.
"
26487,"Spray, count and pat.
"
26488,"- You catch on quick.
"
26489,"- Well, I have a Ph.D., so...
"
26490,"One Mississippi,
"
26491,"two Mississippi, three...
"
26492,"Wait, wait!
"
26493,"I'm not... I'm not finished counting!
"
26494,"You sprayed my front twice!
"
26495,"- You never turned?
"
26496,"- No! I barely got to ""three Mississippi""!
"
26497,"Mississippi? I said count to five.
"
26498,"Mississippi-less-ly?
"
26499,"Well, how bad is it?
"
26500,"Not that bad yet. But it gets
"
26501,"darker for the next four hours.
"
26502,"- So how dark will it get?
"
26503,"- You got sprayed with two twos and...
"
26504,"I'm a four?
"
26505,"Yeah, but your back's a zero.
"
26506,"You'll wanna even that out.
"
26507,"Really?
"
26508,"- You might wanna get back in there.
"
26509,"- Oh, okay!
"
26510,"Wait a minute,
"
26511,"there's no light on the back wall.
"
26512,"How do I know
"
26513,"when it's gonna start? Hello?
"
26514,"My eyes!
"
26515,"The same thing happened again!
"
26516,"- You got two more twos?
"
26517,"- I'm an eight!
"
26518,"Thanks for dinner.
"
26519,"I thought you paid.
"
26520,"Guess we won't be going back there.
"
26521,"- So...
"
26522,"- Yeah.
"
26523,"Hey, what do you say we move this
"
26524,"onto the likes of the couch?
"
26525,"I say cheesy line, but okay.
"
26526,"- What's the matter?
"
26527,"- I don't know. I'm sorry.
"
26528,"- I don't know why I did that.
"
26529,"- Okay.
"
26530,"Okay. Sorry.
"
26531,"I'm sorry. Again, I don't know
"
26532,"what happened. I must be nervous.
"
26533,"I don't get it. Chandler loved it.
"
26534,"I promise. I won't do it again.
"
26535,"I really do. This is gonna be great.
"
26536,"- Okay.
"
26537,"- Okay.
"
26538,"Was that good for you?
"
26539,"No, don't get it.
"
26540,"Let the machine pick up.
"
26541,"Yeah, it could be Rachel asking
"
26542,"if someone could babysit again.
"
26543,"- It could be Amanda.
"
26544,"- Oh, you're right.
"
26545,"I was just kidding about Rachel.
"
26546,"Babysitting's a gas.
"
26547,"Hello, Monica.
"
26548,"It's Amanda calling again.
"
26549,"I'm in the neighborhood,
"
26550,"hoping I could pop by your flat.
"
26551,"You're from Yonkers!
"
26552,"Your last name is Buffamonteezi!
"
26553,"Let's see.
"
26554,"So should you get this directly...
"
26555,"... ring me back on my mobile.
"
26556,"Okay, don't hold thy breath.
"
26557,"- Hello? Is someone on the line?
"
26558,"- Yes. I was looking for Monica.
"
26559,"Hang on, she's right here.
"
26560,"- Someone's on the phone for you.
"
26561,"- We weren't picking up. It's Amanda.
"
26562,"I get pedicures.
"
26563,"Hi, Amanda.
"
26564,"Actually, now is not a good time.
"
26565,"Dinner tomorrow night?
"
26566,"Okay, Phoebe and I will see you then.
"
26567,"Why? Why?
"
26568,"Why didn't you just say no?
"
26569,"Well, I said no to her coming over now.
"
26570,"I couldn't say no twice.
"
26571,"I got this uncontrollable need
"
26572,"to please people.
"
26573,"Fine. Fine. You would not
"
26574,"hold up well under torture.
"
26575,"- Oh, and you would?
"
26576,"- I did.
"
26577,"- Rach, are you sure you wanna do this?
"
26578,"- Absolutely.
"
26579,"It's just a little weird.
"
26580,"It's you, and it's me.
"
26581,"- It'll just take some getting used to.
"
26582,"- Okay.
"
26583,"Okay, well, how can
"
26584,"we make it easier?
"
26585,"Okay. Let's work from the top down.
"
26586,"- Just work the bra, Joe.
"
26587,"- Okay, got it, yeah. Absolutely.
"
26588,"- Okay.
"
26589,"- Okay.
"
26590,"- Is this thing welded shut?
"
26591,"- Okay.
"
26592,"All right, turn around.
"
26593,"I gotta get a look at this thing.
"
26594,"Sorry.
"
26595,"Well, this is romantic.
"
26596,"I'm sorry. This has never
"
26597,"happened to me before.
"
26598,"I'm an expert at taking off bras.
"
26599,"I could do it with one hand.
"
26600,"I could do it with my eyes closed.
"
26601,"Once I just looked at one...
"
26602,"...and it popped open.
"
26603,"- I blame your bra.
"
26604,"- It's a standard-issue bra clasp.
"
26605,"Then I blame you. Yeah. That's right.
"
26606,"You threw me off with all your slapping.
"
26607,"Okay, look, I'm really sorry
"
26608,"about that, Joey.
"
26609,"But do you think maybe, on some level,
"
26610,"you don't want to take off my bra?
"
26611,"No, I don't have another level.
"
26612,"Hold on. There's something different.
"
26613,"I went to that tanning place
"
26614,"your wife suggested.
"
26615,"Was that place the sun?
"
26616,"Oh, and it gets worse.
"
26617,"Oh, my God, you can do a duet
"
26618,"of ""Ebony and Ivory"" all by yourself.
"
26619,"How could you mess this up?
"
26620,"It's so easy.
"
26621,"You go in the booth,
"
26622,"count to five and turn around.
"
26623,"- How do you count to five?
"
26624,"- One, two, three...
"
26625,"Damn it!
"
26626,"I know!
"
26627,"What is up with Miss Hawaiian Tropic?
"
26628,"How was your date with Joey?
"
26629,"Well, it was good,
"
26630,"until we got back to our apartment.
"
26631,"And then we were fooling around and
"
26632,"he started to put his hand up my leg...
"
26633,"...and I kept slapping it away.
"
26634,"You didn't like that?
"
26635,"Well, it wasn't just me, all right?
"
26636,"He freaked out too.
"
26637,"He couldn't even undo my bra.
"
26638,"Really? One time he just looked
"
26639,"at my bra and it popped open.
"
26640,"I do not know what's wrong with us.
"
26641,"We've kissed before
"
26642,"and that's been great.
"
26643,"But this time
"
26644,"it was leading somewhere...
"
26645,"...and I was very aware of the fact
"
26646,"that it was Joey touching me.
"
26647,"You guys have been friends forever.
"
26648,"The first time you kissed Ross
"
26649,"was weird.
"
26650,"You couldn't stop laughing.
"
26651,"You got through that.
"
26652,"Okay. That's true.
"
26653,"That's true, we can do this.
"
26654,"You're right. We can do this.
"
26655,"We'll just power through.
"
26656,"Chandler, can I talk to you
"
26657,"for a second?
"
26658,"No need, problem solved.
"
26659,"We are powering through.
"
26660,"Chandler, stop.
"
26661,"It's not going to pop open.
"
26662,"You don't know.
"
26663,"- Hi, Phoebe.
"
26664,"- Hey.
"
26665,"- Is Amanda here yet?
"
26666,"- No.
"
26667,"I'm sorry for screwing up that ""cutting
"
26668,"her out"" plan, but I have a new plan.
"
26669,"Chandler will call in a few minutes
"
26670,"with an emergency.
"
26671,"Okay, what kind of emergency
"
26672,"gets us both out of here?
"
26673,"What do you think of Mike and Chandler
"
26674,"being in a car accident?
"
26675,"- Are you kidding? I love it!
"
26676,"- Okay.
"
26677,"- Hi.
"
26678,"- Hi.
"
26679,"Hello!
"
26680,"It's so nice to see you.
"
26681,"Both of you, look at me.
"
26682,"Look how young I look!
"
26683,"Oh, gosh, we have
"
26684,"so much to catch up on.
"
26685,"But first things first. Touch my abs.
"
26686,"I don't exercise at all.
"
26687,"Oh, gosh. So, Monica, you're married.
"
26688,"- Yeah, his name is Chandler and he's...
"
26689,"- Oh, smell my neck.
"
26690,"It's not perfume. It's me.
"
26691,"It's my natural scent.
"
26692,"Musty.
"
26693,"Gosh, this is brilliant.
"
26694,"Gosh, it's just like old times.
"
26695,"I'm so happy you two
"
26696,"are friends again.
"
26697,"- When were we not friends?
"
26698,"- Well, it was 1992.
"
26699,"And I remember, because that was
"
26700,"the year I had sex with Evel Knievel.
"
26701,"We were friends in 1992.
"
26702,"No, I distinctly remember
"
26703,"you were dodging her calls...
"
26704,"...and trying to avoid seeing her.
"
26705,"- You were going to cut me out?
"
26706,"- Well, kind of.
"
26707,"- Oh, my God!
"
26708,"- Oh, bugger.
"
26709,"Should I not have said that?
"
26710,"I feel like a perfect arse.
"
26711,"Well, in America, you're just an ass.
"
26712,"Hello?
"
26713,"Chandler, what's wrong?
"
26714,"Oh, my God, are you all right?
"
26715,"Yeah, I'll be right there.
"
26716,"I'm so sorry,
"
26717,"but Chandler was in a car accident.
"
26718,"- Oh, my God.
"
26719,"- Yeah.
"
26720,"- Was Mike with him?
"
26721,"- Nope.
"
26722,"- Got the champagne?
"
26723,"- Yes. Ready to power through.
"
26724,"Excellent. Put it on ice,
"
26725,"the phone is off the hook...
"
26726,"...and, in the interest
"
26727,"of powering through...
"
26728,"Okay, sexy, sexy...
"
26729,"...very sexy. Sexy.
"
26730,"All right, let's do it!
"
26731,"Okay, you're scaring me a little bit.
"
26732,"Get over it, soldier,
"
26733,"we gotta do this.
"
26734,"- Okay. You like that, huh?
"
26735,"- Oh, yeah.
"
26736,"You like that?
"
26737,"Let's kick this into high gear, huh?
"
26738,"Yeah, baby!
"
26739,"I'll show you how we do it!
"
26740,"No, no, no!
"
26741,"You kneed me in my misters!
"
26742,"What? Oh, my God.
"
26743,"I'm so sorry.
"
26744,"Joey? Are you okay?
"
26745,"Soldier down.
"
26746,"We are not friends
"
26747,"with Phoebe anymore.
"
26748,"If she asks,
"
26749,"I protested a little, but okay.
"
26750,"Chandler, thank God you're alive.
"
26751,"Monica, can I talk to you outside?
"
26752,"- I have nothing to say to you.
"
26753,"- My flat is twice this size.
"
26754,"Please, Monica, in the hall?
"
26755,"Oh, that accident
"
26756,"must have been terrible.
"
26757,"You look positively ghastly.
"
26758,"Well, aren't you a treat.
"
26759,"I can't believe you tried to cut me out.
"
26760,"Why, Phoebe? Why?
"
26761,"It was right after we
"
26762,"were living together...
"
26763,"...and you were driving me crazy,
"
26764,"okay?
"
26765,"You were really controlling
"
26766,"and compulsive and shrill.
"
26767,"Well, I'm still all those things!
"
26768,"You're also so generous
"
26769,"and kind and scrappy.
"
26770,"I am scrappy.
"
26771,"Exactly. No matter what I tried to do,
"
26772,"I couldn't keep you out of my life.
"
26773,"Of all the people I've cut out...
"
26774,"...you were the only one
"
26775,"who ever clawed her way back in.
"
26776,"That's because I'm scrappy.
"
26777,"Yeah, you are, and I'm so glad that
"
26778,"you fought your way back in...
"
26779,"...because I don't know what
"
26780,"I would do without you.
"
26781,"I don't know what
"
26782,"I would do without you.
"
26783,"Well, I guess we should go back in.
"
26784,"I mean, you gave me another chance.
"
26785,"- We should do the same for Amanda.
"
26786,"- Yeah, I guess you're right.
"
26787,"Can you believe it? I've never had
"
26788,"any professional dance training.
"
26789,"Let me explain how this works.
"
26790,"Go in the booth and...
"
26791,"I'm gonna stop you
"
26792,"right there, Glenda. Okay?
"
26793,"Does it look like this is
"
26794,"my first time?
"
26795,"Now, I want four two's,
"
26796,"and I want them all on my back.
"
26797,"Okay.
"
26798,"Wait. There's two sets of nozzles!
"
26799,"Which one is it? Which one is it?
"
26800,"Oh, son of a bitch!
"
26801,"What is the matter with us?
"
26802,"Well, I know what's
"
26803,"the matter with me.
"
26804,"No, I mean with us, you know?
"
26805,"I mean, is it supposed to be this...
"
26806,"...difficult?
"
26807,"I don't know.
"
26808,"That fake British woman's a real bitch,
"
26809,"but she sure can dance.
"
26810,"- Hey.
"
26811,"- Hi.
"
26812,"Hey, listen, can I ask you a question?
"
26813,"When you and Monica first hooked up...
"
26814,"...was it weird going from friends
"
26815,"to more than that?
"
26816,"Kind of. Sneaking around,
"
26817,"having to hide from you guys...
"
26818,"No, no, no. No, I mean...
"
26819,"...sexually.
"
26820,"Yeah, was there a part
"
26821,"of you that felt like it was...
"
26822,"...really wrong?
"
26823,"Actually, no.
"
26824,"No, it felt right, you know?
"
26825,"It felt like, ""I can't believe we haven't
"
26826,"been doing this the whole time.""
"
26827,"I can tell from your expressions that's
"
26828,"the good news you were hoping for.
"
26829,"Well, I'm gonna go continue
"
26830,"to spread the joy.
"
26831,"Just because it happened that way
"
26832,"for them doesn't mean it has to for us.
"
26833,"Yeah. Yeah, absolutely.
"
26834,"I mean, just because something's
"
26835,"difficult doesn't mean that you quit.
"
26836,"- Right, totally.
"
26837,"- Yeah. And so...
"
26838,"...we'll just keep trying
"
26839,"and trying until we do it.
"
26840,"If not, we'll just be a couple
"
26841,"that never has sex.
"
26842,"That's a plan.
"
26843,"- I did not see this coming.
"
26844,"- I know.
"
26845,"I don't know, I don't get it. I mean,
"
26846,"I was so sure this is what I wanted.
"
26847,"Me too.
"
26848,"Well, how come Monica and Chandler
"
26849,"could do it?
"
26850,"I guess they weren't
"
26851,"as good friends as we are.
"
26852,"I bet you're right.
"
26853,"So...
"
26854,"Yeah.
"
26855,"I love you.
"
26856,"Love you too.
"
26857,"- All right, I'm going to bed.
"
26858,"- Yeah, me too.
"
26859,"Yeah. I'm not going anywhere
"
26860,"for a while.
"
26861,"- Dude, it's Chandler. Let me in.
"
26862,"- Go away!
"
26863,"I don't wanna see anybody!
"
26864,"I went to the tanning place and the
"
26865,"same thing happened to me. Let me in.
"
26866,"Really?
"
26867,"Did you count Mississippi-ly?
"
26868,"You're not tan.
"
26869,"No. I just had to get a picture of this.
"
26870,"I'll see you later.

"
26875,"- Hey, guys.
"
26876,"- Hey.
"
26877,"Honey, I got us that room at the
"
26878,"Woodford Inn this weekend.
"
26879,"That place in Vermont?
"
26880,"You can take a hint.
"
26881,"You can't go away this weekend.
"
26882,"It's Emma's birthday.
"
26883,"We're having a party.
"
26884,"Can't you have the party
"
26885,"when we get back?
"
26886,"No. It won't be her real birthday.
"
26887,"Gee, if only she were 1 and had
"
26888,"no idea what the hell a birthday was.
"
26889,"Come on, you guys,
"
26890,"this is really important to us.
"
26891,"Sorry, but Chandler and I
"
26892,"could really use a weekend away...
"
26893,"...you know, to reconnect, emotionally.
"
26894,"- There's this thing I really want us to do.
"
26895,"I read about it in Maxim.
"
26896,"Well, can't you just go
"
26897,"to Vermont the next day?
"
26898,"Yeah, we want everyone to be there.
"
26899,"As much as I hate to delay your doing
"
26900,"weird sex stuff to my little sister.
"
26901,"And, I mean, you know, you guys,
"
26902,"this is a big deal.
"
26903,"How can we have her first birthday party
"
26904,"without her aunt and her uncle?
"
26905,"All right, we'll stay.
"
26906,"We can just drive up after the party.
"
26907,"Fine. But if we end up not doing
"
26908,"this Maxim thing because of this party...
"
26909,"Believe me, that is not why
"
26910,"we won't be doing that.
"
26911,"The One With the Cake
"
26912,"You know, Pheebs, when I was little,
"
26913,"on my birthday...
"
26914,"...my daddy would hide a present
"
26915,"in every room of the house.
"
26916,"And then he would draw a treasure map
"
26917,"to help me find them all.
"
26918,"I love family traditions like that.
"
26919,"When Ursula and I were kids,
"
26920,"on our birthday...
"
26921,"...our stepdad would sell his blood
"
26922,"to buy us food.
"
26923,"- Hey, guys.
"
26924,"- Hi.
"
26925,"- I brought the camera for Emma's video.
"
26926,"- Oh, good!
"
26927,"We had this idea to make
"
26928,"a birthday video for Emma...
"
26929,"...and we'll give it to her when she's 18.
"
26930,"- Oh, cool.
"
26931,"- Wow, it's like a time capsule.
"
26932,"- Yeah.
"
26933,"Oh, just think, she's gonna be
"
26934,"watching that video on a TV...
"
26935,"...that hasn't even been invented yet...
"
26936,"...with friends who, right now,
"
26937,"are just, like, babies.
"
26938,"And they'll be living in a floating city
"
26939,"that the humans built...
"
26940,"...to escape the ant people.
"
26941,"That's the hope.
"
26942,"- So is Emma awake yet?
"
26943,"- No, it's still naptime.
"
26944,"- But she'll be up soon.
"
26945,"- Where's Joey?
"
26946,"I said, it's still naptime.
"
26947,"- Hey, there's Uncle Joey.
"
26948,"- Hey.
"
26949,"Hey, say something to Emma
"
26950,"on her 18th birthday.
"
26951,"- Eighteen, huh?
"
26952,"- Joey, no!
"
26953,"What? What? It's for her hot friends.
"
26954,"When they see this, you'll be 52.
"
26955,"And starting to think about
"
26956,"settling down.
"
26957,"Joey, will you please set this up
"
26958,"for people to put Emma's presents on?
"
26959,"Love to. Yeah.
"
26960,"- We were supposed to bring presents?
"
26961,"- Yeah. I wrote Emma a song.
"
26962,"Oh, yeah.
"
26963,"How was I supposed to know?
"
26964,"- Joey, it's a birthday party.
"
26965,"- Yeah, but for a 1 -year-old.
"
26966,"What's the point? The other day
"
26967,"she laughed for an hour at a cup.
"
26968,"Just a cup with a picture of Elmo on it,
"
26969,"dressed as a farmer.
"
26970,"And he's standing next to this cow,
"
26971,"and the cow says, ""El-moo.""
"
26972,"Man, that's a funny cup.
"
26973,"- Hey.
"
26974,"- Hey.
"
26975,"- Where's the birthday girl?
"
26976,"- Oh, she's still napping.
"
26977,"She was probably up all night excited
"
26978,"about the party she knows is happening.
"
26979,"I know you guys really want to get to
"
26980,"Vermont, and this isn't a big deal to you.
"
26981,"But it really is to us, okay? Emma
"
26982,"will never have a first birthday again.
"
26983,"You're right. We're sorry.
"
26984,"Let's wake up Emma
"
26985,"and get the fun time started!
"
26986,"She didn't sleep well last night,
"
26987,"so we can't wake her.
"
26988,"Are you frigging kidding me, Greene?
"
26989,"- Hi!
"
26990,"- Hey!
"
26991,"- I'm so glad you came.
"
26992,"- I can't believe Emma's already 1.
"
26993,"I remember your first birthday.
"
26994,"Ross was jealous of all the attention
"
26995,"we were giving you.
"
26996,"He pulled on his testicles so hard...
"
26997,"...we had to take him
"
26998,"to the emergency room.
"
26999,"There's something you didn't know
"
27000,"about your dad.
"
27001,"Hey, Mr. and Mrs. Geller.
"
27002,"Let me help you with that.
"
27003,"- Thank you.
"
27004,"- Oh, man, this is great, huh?
"
27005,"The three of us together again.
"
27006,"You know what would be fun?
"
27007,"If we gave this present to Emma
"
27008,"from all of us.
"
27009,"Which one are you?
"
27010,"- I can't believe Emma's still asleep.
"
27011,"- I know. What are we gonna do?
"
27012,"I've got a plan. I've got a plan.
"
27013,"I'm going to ram this platter
"
27014,"really hard into your ribs.
"
27015,"You're gonna scream out,
"
27016,"and that'll wake her up.
"
27017,"I'm not going to Vermont
"
27018,"with this Monica.
"
27019,"Hey, Pheebs? You know what?
"
27020,"I was thinking
"
27021,"since you wrote a song...
"
27022,"...maybe I could do something
"
27023,"for Emma using my talents.
"
27024,"So you're gonna hit on her?
"
27025,"No, no, no. My talents as an actor.
"
27026,"You know, I could, like, maybe...
"
27027,"I could do a dramatic reading
"
27028,"of one of her books.
"
27029,"Or you could stick a fork in an apple.
"
27030,"- Hey, I think Emma might like it.
"
27031,"- Oh, Emma might like what?
"
27032,"- My present.
"
27033,"- What did you get her?
"
27034,"- We prepared performances.
"
27035,"- Separate performances.
"
27036,"But equally real.
"
27037,"That sounds like fun.
"
27038,"People are getting a little antsy waiting
"
27039,"for Emma to wake up from her nap.
"
27040,"So would you mind
"
27041,"performing them once now?
"
27042,"- Sure, yeah!
"
27043,"- Okay.
"
27044,"Okay. All right. Everybody,
"
27045,"let's get this party started.
"
27046,"Joey and Phoebe are gonna perform
"
27047,"a little something for us.
"
27048,"Oh, great.
"
27049,"Aren't you gonna be embarrassed
"
27050,"having nothing prepared?
"
27051,"I do it every week with three cameras
"
27052,"pointed at me and a whole crew waiting.
"
27053,"So, Joey, what are you gonna do for us?
"
27054,"I will be doing a dramatic reading
"
27055,"of one of Emma's books.
"
27056,"Oh, okay. Which one?
"
27057,"Well, it's one of her favorites.
"
27058,"""Riding the Storm Out:
"
27059,"Coping With Postpartum Depression.""
"
27060,"Love You Forever.

27064,"A mother held her new baby
"
27065,"and very slowly rocked him...
"
27066,"...back and forth, back and forth,

27067,"back and forth.

27068,"And while she held him, she sang,
"
27069,"'I'll love you forever.
"
27070,"I'll like you for always.

"
27078,"Oh, wow!
"
27079,"That was amazing.
"
27080,"Thank you so much for that gift.
"
27081,"I was not ready for this today.
"
27082,"- Amazing. Amazing.
"
27083,"- Phoebe, I'm sorry.
"
27084,"- Phoebe has prepared something as well.
"
27085,"- That's right.
"
27086,"I prepared a song for Emma,
"
27087,"from my heart to hers.
"
27088,"For there's no greater gift
"
27089,"than the gift of music.
"
27090,"Emma!
"
27091,"Your name poses a dilemma.
"
27092,"'Cause not much else rhymes with Emma!
"
27093,"Maybe the actor Richard Crenna...
"
27094,"(he played the commanding officer
"
27095,"in Rambo)
"
27096,"Happy birthday Emma!
"
27097,"Is that it?
"
27098,"No, of course not.
"
27099,"No, I've also, you know,
"
27100,"prepared a reading.
"
27101,"""Sex and the Single Mother.""
"
27102,"- ""Finding your G-spot.""
"
27103,"- Oh, no, no, no!
"
27104,"Hello, Emma. Happy 18th birthday.
"
27105,"Right now, that seems so far away,
"
27106,"17 years.
"
27107,"Yes. You'll be all grown up
"
27108,"by then, and we'll be...
"
27109,"Well, your grandfather and I
"
27110,"might not be here.
"
27111,"That's true. This message
"
27112,"could be coming to you...
"
27113,"...from beyond the grave, Emma.
"
27114,"- After all, my parents died very young.
"
27115,"- And my cholesterol's off the charts.
"
27116,"Remember, Emma,
"
27117,"heart disease kills women too.
"
27118,"Okay, cut! Great. Great.
"
27119,"That was just...
"
27120,"- Yeah.
"
27121,"- Oh, good.
"
27122,"Ross, don't forget to get a shot
"
27123,"of Emma's cake.
"
27124,"- It's in a box in the fridge.
"
27125,"- Okay, sure.
"
27126,"You're gonna love this cake. I got it
"
27127,"from a bakery in New Jersey, Carino's.
"
27128,"Oh, my God, that place has
"
27129,"the creamiest frosting!
"
27130,"I used to hitchhike there
"
27131,"when I was a kid.
"
27132,"Well, anyway, they make
"
27133,"these great novelty cakes...
"
27134,"...in all different shapes. And if you give
"
27135,"them a photo, they'll copy it in icing.
"
27136,"- Did you do a picture of Emma?
"
27137,"- Yes. On a cake shaped like a bunny.
"
27138,"Rach? Does this bakery
"
27139,"by any chance also bake...
"
27140,"...erotic cakes?
"
27141,"Say, for bachelorette parties?
"
27142,"Ross, what are you talking...?
"
27143,"Oh, my God!
"
27144,"They put my baby's face on a penis!
"
27145,"Now it's a party!
"
27146,"Wait, you guys, this isn't funny.
"
27147,"If I wanted this cake to be a disaster,
"
27148,"I would have baked it myself!
"
27149,"Is it okay that I still think
"
27150,"it looks delicious?
"
27151,"- Jack, look at this.
"
27152,"- I know what you're thinking, Judy.
"
27153,"The resemblance is uncanny.
"
27154,"I am this close to tugging
"
27155,"on my testicles again.
"
27156,"No, no, this is not what I ordered,
"
27157,"okay?
"
27158,"I went all the way to New Jersey
"
27159,"so that I could have the perfect cake...
"
27160,"...for my daughter's birthday.
"
27161,"And I need a bunny cake right now!
"
27162,"Ask them if it would be faster
"
27163,"if we cut the baby's face off the penis...
"
27164,"...so we could put it on the bunny.
"
27165,"That is a weird sentence.
"
27166,"Oh, believe you me,
"
27167,"I am going to bring this cake back.
"
27168,"I don't even want it in my home.
"
27169,"Don't touch it!
"
27170,"I'm so confused!
"
27171,"Yes, I still want my daughter's picture,
"
27172,"but on a bunny cake!
"
27173,"Yellow cake, chocolate frosting
"
27174,"with nuts!
"
27175,"To be fair, this one does have nuts.
"
27176,"Mon, it was nice of you
"
27177,"to loan Rachel your car...
"
27178,"...so she could get the cake.
"
27179,"- It was nice of her to pull my hair...
"
27180,"...till I dropped the key.
"
27181,"Well, while we're waiting,
"
27182,"you could tape your message to Emma...
"
27183,"...for her 18th birthday, huh? Okay?
"
27184,"Hi, Emma. It's the year 2020.
"
27185,"Are you still enjoying your nap?
"
27186,"We're Aunt Monica
"
27187,"and Uncle Chandler, by the way.
"
27188,"You may not recognize us...
"
27189,"...because we haven't spoken
"
27190,"to your parents in 17 years.
"
27191,"We used to be married.
"
27192,"But then we missed a weekend away
"
27193,"together, and things kind of unraveled...
"
27194,"...because of you.
"
27195,"Happy birthday.
"
27196,"Ross, Rachel promised
"
27197,"it would be over by now.
"
27198,"We seriously have to go
"
27199,"if we want to get to Vermont.
"
27200,"- The last train leaves in a half-hour.
"
27201,"- And I have a massage client soon.
"
27202,"You guys, just, please, a little bit longer.
"
27203,"I promise, Rachel will be back
"
27204,"with the cake any minute.
"
27205,"Monica, remember the frosting, huh?
"
27206,"All right, five more minutes.
"
27207,"Hello?
"
27208,"Oh, no, what happened?
"
27209,"Okay, okay, where are you?
"
27210,"Okay, I'll be right there.
"
27211,"Was that Emma? Is she up?
"
27212,"Rachel got pulled over for speeding.
"
27213,"She forgot her license.
"
27214,"I have to bring it to her.
"
27215,"- lf you're leaving, I'm definitely going.
"
27216,"- Wait, if anybody gets to go, it's us!
"
27217,"We've been complaining the longest!
"
27218,"No, wait, you guys.
"
27219,"No, you can't leave.
"
27220,"Rachel already feels bad
"
27221,"that the cake's messed up.
"
27222,"How do you think she'll feel
"
27223,"when she comes back and you're gone?
"
27224,"I don't know. You'll tell us on Monday.
"
27225,"Joey, you're in charge, okay?
"
27226,"You make sure nobody leaves.
"
27227,"Got it!
"
27228,"Hey! Where do you think
"
27229,"you're going?
"
27230,"To the bathroom.
"
27231,"Well, the rest of you get comfortable,
"
27232,"because we are gonna be here for a...
"
27233,"- Wait, there's a window in there.
"
27234,"- No! He's not getting away that easy!
"
27235,"What are you doing?
"
27236,"Get the hell out of here!
"
27237,"Well, that one did not have
"
27238,"Emma's face on it.
"
27239,"- No, it did not.
"
27240,"- No.
"
27241,"Well, we'd better get going. It's late.
"
27242,"Jack can't drive at night anymore.
"
27243,"He has trouble staying in his lane.
"
27244,"Last winter I went up on a church lawn
"
27245,"and drove right through a manger scene.
"
27246,"The papers thought it was
"
27247,"a hate crime.
"
27248,"- Anyway, it was lovely seeing you.
"
27249,"- Okay.
"
27250,"- Bye. Bye, dear.
"
27251,"- Nighty-night.
"
27252,"- Nighty-night.
"
27253,"- Bye.
"
27254,"- How could you just let them leave?
"
27255,"- Hey, hey, hey.
"
27256,"I'm not gonna mess with Jack. He's
"
27257,"a great man. He fought for our country.
"
27258,"No, he didn't. He pretended to be
"
27259,"a Quaker to get out of Korea.
"
27260,"Well, that's it. He's the last one to go.
"
27261,"I'm locking you guys in.
"
27262,"You do know I can just turn them
"
27263,"the other way around, right?
"
27264,"Oh, I forgot you used to live here.
"
27265,"- Hello?
"
27266,"- Joey, it's Estelle.
"
27267,"- Hey.
"
27268,"- So how'd your audition go today?
"
27269,"- What audition?
"
27270,"- The one I told you about last week.
"
27271,"What? You never said anything
"
27272,"about an audition.
"
27273,"Let me start over.
"
27274,"I just got a call about an audition.
"
27275,"I think you can still make it.
"
27276,"It's down at the Astor Theater, and you
"
27277,"need to have a monologue prepared.
"
27278,"A monologue? I don't have a...
"
27279,"I got it.
"
27280,"So I'm gonna take off.
"
27281,"- What?
"
27282,"- No, wait! You don't get to leave.
"
27283,"I've got a massage client waiting
"
27284,"outside my door any minute.
"
27285,"And we paid for a room
"
27286,"that we're supposed to be in right now!
"
27287,"Well, okay, now...
"
27288,"...only one of us has to stay
"
27289,"with Emma.
"
27290,"Okay, and as the person
"
27291,"who realized that, I get to go.
"
27292,"No, no, no. No. No.
"
27293,"Let's figure out a fair way
"
27294,"to decide who's staying.
"
27295,"Oh, I got it.
"
27296,"Okay, everyone pick a number from
"
27297,"one to 10, all right?
"
27298,"Whoever gets the highest number
"
27299,"gets to go first.
"
27300,"- Okay, 10.
"
27301,"- Okay, Monica picks 10. I call nine.
"
27302,"Anyone else?
"
27303,"- No, let's just draw straws.
"
27304,"- Okay.
"
27305,"Or we could flip a coin
"
27306,"and multiply the answer...
"
27307,"- I'm begging you to stop.
"
27308,"- Right.
"
27309,"Okay, how about this?
"
27310,"We got wind-up toys for Emma.
"
27311,"We can make them race,
"
27312,"and whoever comes in last stays.
"
27313,"Yeah, let's do that!
"
27314,"That sounds more fun than the thing
"
27315,"we were gonna do in Vermont!
"
27316,"- Okay, everybody, pick your toys!
"
27317,"- Okay. I want the dolphin!
"
27318,"- That's a bear!
"
27319,"- I'm too excited!
"
27320,"Phoebe, you get the bear.
"
27321,"Joey, you get the robot.
"
27322,"- Oh, yeah.
"
27323,"- And Chandler and I get the dog.
"
27324,"And the race is going to go
"
27325,"from here to here.
"
27326,"Now, the one who comes in last stays!
"
27327,"Okay, ladies and gentlemen,
"
27328,"wind your toys.
"
27329,"- Okay. On your mark, get set, go!
"
27330,"- Go! Go!
"
27331,"Come on, robot!
"
27332,"What are you barking at?
"
27333,"Well, how is that gonna help?
"
27334,"I bought you! How did I forget
"
27335,"that that's all you do?
"
27336,"Way to go, robot!
"
27337,"Good job, Alan.
"
27338,"- Hey, good race, you guys.
"
27339,"- Yeah, see you later.
"
27340,"No. No, no. Wait.
"
27341,"We didn't lose.
"
27342,"The rules clearly stated that the last one
"
27343,"to cross the finish line was the loser.
"
27344,"Well, our dog never crossed
"
27345,"the finish line. So technically...
"
27346,"They left.
"
27347,"There isn't time to go to the bakery.
"
27348,"We're gonna come home.
"
27349,"Everybody left?
"
27350,"All right. Well, just tell Emma that
"
27351,"we'll be there as soon as we can. Bye.
"
27352,"- Rachel!
"
27353,"- Oh, God, sorry!
"
27354,"I can't believe they gave you a ticket.
"
27355,"You're such a good driver.
"
27356,"- Emma's awake.
"
27357,"- Yeah?
"
27358,"I can't believe this.
"
27359,"This is her first birthday, she's awake,
"
27360,"we're not even there.
"
27361,"Everybody left. We still have
"
27362,"this stupid obscene cake.
"
27363,"Hey, maybe I can fix that. You know,
"
27364,"try to turn it into something else.
"
27365,"Oh, don't even bother.
"
27366,"We've already ruined
"
27367,"her first birthday.
"
27368,"And do you know how important these
"
27369,"early experiences are, Ross? Very!
"
27370,"According to the back cover
"
27371,"of that book that you gave me.
"
27372,"Rach, she's not gonna remember this.
"
27373,"I guess.
"
27374,"Oh, I just had such an idea of what
"
27375,"this day would be like, you know?
"
27376,"Emma laughing...
"
27377,"...and everybody gathered around
"
27378,"her cake, singing ""Happy Birthday.""
"
27379,"And then we would all... Hey, get out
"
27380,"of the road, you stupid student driver!
"
27381,"They have to learn.
"
27382,"- Hey.
"
27383,"- What?
"
27384,"This is not bad.
"
27385,"Oh, my God. Look, you made it
"
27386,"into a bunny. How did you do that?
"
27387,"Well, I just made these
"
27388,"two things cheeks.
"
27389,"And then I split this to make ears.
"
27390,"Well, I am very impressed.
"
27391,"Some can sing, some can dance.
"
27392,"I, apparently, can turn phallic cakes
"
27393,"into woodland creatures.
"
27394,"Now, another way to organize
"
27395,"your stuffed animals is by size.
"
27396,"I'm sorry, is this a game for Emma
"
27397,"or for Monica?
"
27398,"Game?
"
27399,"Emma, do you even know it's
"
27400,"your birthday today? You're 1.
"
27401,"One year old. That's little.
"
27402,"That's my girl.
"
27403,"That's how old you are.
"
27404,"Did I teach her that?
"
27405,"Did I just impart wisdom?
"
27406,"I want one.
"
27407,"Me too.
"
27408,"There's no one around.
"
27409,"Why don't we just take this one?
"
27410,"- And head to Canada.
"
27411,"- I was kidding.
"
27412,"I wasn't. Let's get going.
"
27413,"- Hey, are Ross and Rachel back?
"
27414,"- No, not yet.
"
27415,"- Oh, good, I didn't miss the party.
"
27416,"- What about your massage client?
"
27417,"I just felt so bad missing this. So I just
"
27418,"slipped him a little something, you know.
"
27419,"As long as I'm back in five
"
27420,"or six hours, it'll be all right.
"
27421,"Okay.
"
27422,"If Ross and Rachel ask, I've been
"
27423,"here the whole time. The whole time.
"
27424,"I've been here the whole time.
"
27425,"Joey, we just saw you come in.
"
27426,"You ran past us on the stairs.
"
27427,"I don't care that you left. I'm just glad
"
27428,"that you're here. Thanks, you guys.
"
27429,"Hey, guys, come on. You gotta see
"
27430,"what Emma just did.
"
27431,"- What?
"
27432,"- Emma, how old are you?
"
27433,"How old are you today?
"
27434,"Emma, that's right. You're that many.
"
27435,"Oh, my God, our daughter's a genius.
"
27436,"- This means...
"
27437,"- No! No science camp!
"
27438,"Damn it! I'll put a candle on the cake.
"
27439,"Oh, and, Emma, look at your
"
27440,"stuffed animals lined up so neatly.
"
27441,"Thanks.
"
27442,"Okay, here we go.
"
27443,"Emma's first birthday cake.
"
27444,"Go ahead, Emma,
"
27445,"blow out the candle.
"
27446,"Come on, Emma. You can do it.
"
27447,"- What's wrong? Are you okay?
"
27448,"- Oh, yeah, nothing.
"
27449,"These are happy tears.
"
27450,"This is just what I wanted.
"
27451,"Hey, you made it into a bunny.
"
27452,"What is wrong with me? It looked
"
27453,"more delicious when it was a penis.
"
27454,"- Okay, you ready?
"
27455,"- Yeah.
"
27456,"- And record.
"
27457,"- Okay.
"
27458,"Hi, Emma.
"
27459,"Well, your first birthday is over, and...
"
27460,"Go! Go! Come on!
"
27461,"Go! Go! Come on!
"
27462,"Go! Go, Alan!
"
27463,"Run, you hairy bastard!

"
27468,"You know, I'm thinking about letting
"
27469,"Emma have her first cookie.
"
27470,"Her first cookie?
"
27471,"She has cookies all the time.
"
27472,"I've never given her a cookie.
"
27473,"- Have you?
"
27474,"- No.
"
27475,"No. And for the record, I've also
"
27476,"never given her frosting from a can.
"
27477,"Hey, Rach, the adoption agency
"
27478,"needs letters of recommendation...
"
27479,"...and we wondered
"
27480,"if you would write one for us?
"
27481,"- Of course. I would be honored.
"
27482,"- Thank you.
"
27483,"I think there's been an oversight.
"
27484,"We would have asked you.
"
27485,"We thought you wouldn't be interested.
"
27486,"It's just that we don't think of you
"
27487,"as really being so much with the words.
"
27488,"Clearly, we were wrong.
"
27489,"I got a lot of nice stuff
"
27490,"to say about you guys, okay?
"
27491,"I know how much you want
"
27492,"to have a baby...
"
27493,"...and I would love
"
27494,"to help you get one.
"
27495,"You know what?
"
27496,"Then we want you to do it.
"
27497,"Thank you. All right.
"
27498,"Let me see how I'm gonna start.
"
27499,"""Dear Baby Adoption Decider People...""
"
27500,"So excited about your letter.
"
27501,"- Hey.
"
27502,"- Hey, Phoebe.
"
27503,"- Wow, don't you look nice.
"
27504,"- Yes, I do.
"
27505,"Today's Mike and my
"
27506,"one-year anniversary.
"
27507,"What's it the anniversary of?
"
27508,"Your first date, your first kiss,
"
27509,"first time you had sex?
"
27510,"Yeah.
"
27511,"So you must be going somewhere
"
27512,"fancy to celebrate.
"
27513,"A Knicks game.
"
27514,"Aren't you a little overdressed?
"
27515,"I've never had a one-year
"
27516,"anniversary before...
"
27517,"...so no matter where we go,
"
27518,"I'm wearing something fancy...
"
27519,"...I'm gonna put on
"
27520,"my finest jewelry...
"
27521,"...and we're gonna have sex
"
27522,"in a public restroom.
"
27523,"You guys do that?
"
27524,"Chandler won't even have sex
"
27525,"in our bathroom.
"
27526,"That's where people
"
27527,"make number two.
"
27528,"The One Where Rachel's Sister Babysits
"
27529,"So, you know, I have a little time
"
27530,"if you want to...
"
27531,"I'd love to, but I really have
"
27532,"to grade these papers.
"
27533,"Fine. It's fine.
"
27534,"I'll just shower by myself.
"
27535,"B. B. B. B. B.
"
27536,"You gave a B
"
27537,"to a Pottery Barn catalog.
"
27538,"Well, it had some good ideas.
"
27539,"Take off your shirt.
"
27540,"- Damn it.
"
27541,"- Rachel, open up! It's your sister!
"
27542,"I have to talk to you.
"
27543,"Hi, Amy.
"
27544,"- You're not Rachel.
"
27545,"- Still sharp as a tack.
"
27546,"Charlie, this is Rachel's sister Amy.
"
27547,"Amy, this is Charlie.
"
27548,"- Hi. Nice to meet you.
"
27549,"- Hi, hi.
"
27550,"And you are?
"
27551,"Ross? I grew up on your block?
"
27552,"We had Thanksgiving together
"
27553,"last year?
"
27554,"I had a baby with your sister?
"
27555,"No. I...
"
27556,"Did I buy a falafel
"
27557,"from you yesterday?
"
27558,"Yes. Yes, you did.
"
27559,"Hi, Rachel.
"
27560,"Here's your sister Amy.
"
27561,"She thinks I need pec implants.
"
27562,"Amy? Hi.
"
27563,"- You remember Joey.
"
27564,"- Yeah. Hey, sure.
"
27565,"- The Days of our Lives guy.
"
27566,"- That's right, yeah.
"
27567,"You are not good.
"
27568,"Always nice to meet a fan.
"
27569,"- So, now, what are you doing here?
"
27570,"- Well, I have huge news.
"
27571,"- Hold on. Let me check on the baby.
"
27572,"- This is important. Can't Ella wait?
"
27573,"Her name is Emma.
"
27574,"Why did you change it?
"
27575,"Ella was so much prettier.
"
27576,"What do I know? I just sell
"
27577,"Middle Eastern food from a cart.
"
27578,"Hey, your English is getting better.
"
27579,"- Oh, my God.
"
27580,"- I know.
"
27581,"She may be the hottest girl
"
27582,"I've ever hated.
"
27583,"- What you working on?
"
27584,"- Monica and Chandler's recommendation.
"
27585,"I want it to sound smart, but I don't
"
27586,"know any big words or anything.
"
27587,"- Why don't you use your thesaurus?
"
27588,"- What did I just say?
"
27589,"Watch.
"
27590,"Here, highlight the word you want
"
27591,"to change, go under ""tools""...
"
27592,"...and the thesaurus generates...
"
27593,"Gives.
"
27594,"Gives a whole list of choices.
"
27595,"You can pick the word
"
27596,"that sounds smartest.
"
27597,"My God, that's great. I'm smart.
"
27598,"No, no, I'm:
"
27599,"""Brainy, bright, clever.""
"
27600,"I love this thing!
"
27601,"Look out, ladies!
"
27602,"Joey Tribbiani's got the whole package!
"
27603,"God...
"
27604,"...so beautiful.
"
27605,"I know, isn't she?
"
27606,"No, I was talking about your bedding.
"
27607,"All right, what's your news, Amy?
"
27608,"Well...
"
27609,"...I'm getting married.
"
27610,"Wow! Oh, my God!
"
27611,"- To who?
"
27612,"- This guy.
"
27613,"He has a killer apartment.
"
27614,"- And...?
"
27615,"- And it's on Fifth.
"
27616,"And the elevator opens up
"
27617,"right into the living room.
"
27618,"- No, what's he like?
"
27619,"- Oh, he's okay.
"
27620,"Do you remember
"
27621,"my old boyfriend Mark?
"
27622,"- Yeah.
"
27623,"- It's his dad.
"
27624,"- Wow, so he's gotta be...
"
27625,"- Old? Yeah.
"
27626,"But he travels a lot,
"
27627,"so he's hardly ever there.
"
27628,"Sweetie, I gotta tell you,
"
27629,"it sounds a little bit like...
"
27630,"...you like the apartment
"
27631,"more than you like...
"
27632,"Myron.
"
27633,"Yeah, I told you he was old.
"
27634,"Sit down. Sit down.
"
27635,"Honey, you know...
"
27636,"...I once also almost married
"
27637,"somebody that I didn't love.
"
27638,"- Do you remember Barry?
"
27639,"- Remember him?
"
27640,"God, we used to make out all the time
"
27641,"after you went to sleep.
"
27642,"Sometimes just nodding is okay.
"
27643,"But anyway, listen.
"
27644,"Not marrying Barry was the best
"
27645,"decision that I ever, ever made.
"
27646,"Honey, Amy, you deserve true love.
"
27647,"Your soul mate is out there somewhere.
"
27648,"Someone that is your age,
"
27649,"that is smart, that is fun...
"
27650,"...and that you care about.
"
27651,"You're right.
"
27652,"- You're right. I'm gonna do it.
"
27653,"- Okay.
"
27654,"I'm gonna marry Myron
"
27655,"and keep looking for Mr. Right.
"
27656,"Okay, let's keep talking.
"
27657,"Excuse me. Anniversary.
"
27658,"Excuse me. Anniversary.
"
27659,"Sir, could you move your nachos?
"
27660,"They're in my seat.
"
27661,"It's my anniversary.
"
27662,"Here we are.
"
27663,"- I can't believe it's been a whole year.
"
27664,"- I know.
"
27665,"This has been the best year...
"
27666,"- This has been the best year of my life!
"
27667,"- Me too!
"
27668,"I never thought I could
"
27669,"love someone this much!
"
27670,"I feel the same way!
"
27671,"You're so generous and kind,
"
27672,"and you're amazing in bed!
"
27673,"It's our anniversary.
"
27674,"Knicks fans, please turn your attention
"
27675,"to the big screen on the scoreboard.
"
27676,"Someone has a special question to ask.
"
27677,"How lame.
"
27678,"It's so tacky and impersonal.
"
27679,"- Really?
"
27680,"- It's the worst way to propose.
"
27681,"Excuse me.
"
27682,"I finished my recommendation.
"
27683,"Here.
"
27684,"And I think you'll be very, very happy.
"
27685,"It's the longest I ever spent
"
27686,"on a computer without looking at porn.
"
27687,"I don't understand.
"
27688,"Some of the words a little
"
27689,"too sophisticated for you?
"
27690,"It doesn't make any sense.
"
27691,"Well, of course it does. It's smart.
"
27692,"I used a thesaurus.
"
27693,"On every word?
"
27694,"Yep.
"
27695,"All right, what was
"
27696,"this sentence originally?
"
27697,"""They are warm, nice people
"
27698,"with big hearts.""
"
27699,"And that became, ""They are humid,
"
27700,"prepossessing Homo sapiens...
"
27701,"...with full-sized aortic pumps.""
"
27702,"Yeah. Yeah. And hey,
"
27703,"I really mean it, dude.
"
27704,"All right, Joey,
"
27705,"I don't think we can use this.
"
27706,"- Why not?
"
27707,"- Well, because you signed it:
"
27708,"""Baby Kangaroo Tribbiani.""
"
27709,"Why don't you stop worrying about
"
27710,"sounding smart and just be yourself.
"
27711,"You don't need a thesaurus.
"
27712,"Just write from here.
"
27713,"Your full-sized aortic pump.
"
27714,"- Amy. Hi.
"
27715,"- I took your advice.
"
27716,"- I left Myron.
"
27717,"- Good for you!
"
27718,"I know. I'm Erin Brockovich.
"
27719,"Yes, you are.
"
27720,"- I'm so proud of you.
"
27721,"- Thank you.
"
27722,"So can I stay with you?
"
27723,"But Erin Brockovich had her own house.
"
27724,"Look who's back.
"
27725,"Why do you have bags?
"
27726,"Why does she have bags?
"
27727,"I'm staying with you guys.
"
27728,"- What?
"
27729,"- We're gonna be roomies!
"
27730,"Come on.
"
27731,"- You slept out here?
"
27732,"- Yeah.
"
27733,"Amy kept kicking me in her sleep,
"
27734,"yelling, ""Myron, get off!""
"
27735,"But we're getting rid of her, right?
"
27736,"Please tell me we're getting rid of her?
"
27737,"- Joey, I can't do that.
"
27738,"- Oh, come on.
"
27739,"Last night I was finishing off a pizza,
"
27740,"and she said:
"
27741,"""A moment on the lips,
"
27742,"forever on the hips.""
"
27743,"I don't need that kind of talk
"
27744,"in my house!
"
27745,"Joey, look,
"
27746,"I know that she's difficult...
"
27747,"...but I think it's really good
"
27748,"that she's here.
"
27749,"Because we'll appreciate it
"
27750,"more when she's gone?
"
27751,"No, it's just... Look, when I first moved
"
27752,"to this city, I was a lot like her.
"
27753,"I was spoiled, self-centered.
"
27754,"And you guys really took care of me.
"
27755,"Yeah. Monica made us.
"
27756,"Well, whatever.
"
27757,"I really appreciate it...
"
27758,"...because I don't think I would be
"
27759,"the person I am today...
"
27760,"...if it wasn't for you guys.
"
27761,"So I want to help Amy
"
27762,"the way you guys helped me.
"
27763,"And I know it's gonna take patience,
"
27764,"but that's okay.
"
27765,"- Good morning.
"
27766,"- Yeah.
"
27767,"That's what I'm wearing today.
"
27768,"That's why I hung it on the door.
"
27769,"Oh, sweetie, you can't pull this off.
"
27770,"You know what? I was thinking that
"
27771,"maybe now would be a good time...
"
27772,"...for us to sit down and, you know,
"
27773,"talk about your future.
"
27774,"Oh, I can't, honey. I'm gonna go
"
27775,"get my eyebrows shaped.
"
27776,"I am not happy.
"
27777,"Sure you want to eat that?
"
27778,"I'm curvy and I like it!
"
27779,"- Hi.
"
27780,"- Hi.
"
27781,"I just had the worst anniversary ever.
"
27782,"I doubt that.
"
27783,"Tell her about us last year.
"
27784,"Well, I bought Chandler a $500 watch,
"
27785,"and he wrote me a rap song.
"
27786,"- Seriously?
"
27787,"- Word.
"
27788,"Mine was worse than that.
"
27789,"- Well, what happened?
"
27790,"- We were at the game.
"
27791,"This guy proposed to his girlfriend
"
27792,"on the big screen thing.
"
27793,"- That is so tacky.
"
27794,"- Well, that's what I said.
"
27795,"But it turns out Mike was planning to
"
27796,"propose to me that same way last night.
"
27797,"Oh, my God.
"
27798,"Mike was gonna propose?
"
27799,"- That's huge.
"
27800,"- Do you want to marry him?
"
27801,"Yeah, I really do. Yes.
"
27802,"But after I dumped on the way
"
27803,"he was gonna do it...
"
27804,"...I don't think he'll ever ask again.
"
27805,"I said no in Barbados, and now this?
"
27806,"She's right. If I were a guy and...
"
27807,"Did I just say, ""If I were a guy""?
"
27808,"You don't need him to propose to you.
"
27809,"Maybe you could propose to him.
"
27810,"Oh, I don't know. I don't know.
"
27811,"Isn't that a little desperate?
"
27812,"I proposed to Chandler.
"
27813,"All right, moving on.
"
27814,"I don't think it was desperate.
"
27815,"It was amazing.
"
27816,"Thank you.
"
27817,"- Well, do you think I should propose?
"
27818,"- I think it could be kind of great.
"
27819,"Absolutely. You'll love the feeling.
"
27820,"There's nothing like it.
"
27821,"Okay. Okay.
"
27822,"So how should I do it?
"
27823,"How about at a game
"
27824,"on the big screen?
"
27825,"How about at a Foot Locker?
"
27826,"What? What, he obviously thinks
"
27827,"that's a nice way to be proposed to.
"
27828,"- Plus, he'd never suspect it.
"
27829,"- Yeah, that does make sense.
"
27830,"- Okay, now, would you two like that?
"
27831,"- Sounds good to me.
"
27832,"But what would a guy think?
"
27833,"- Nana's on the phone.
"
27834,"- Wow.
"
27835,"That's interesting,
"
27836,"since she died seven years ago.
"
27837,"She did?
"
27838,"Who got her condo in Boca?
"
27839,"Hello?
"
27840,"It's our nanny.
"
27841,"Hi.
"
27842,"Oh, God, I hope you feel better.
"
27843,"Okay. Bye.
"
27844,"That's Molly. She's sick.
"
27845,"- Can you watch Emma today?
"
27846,"- I can't. I have back-to-back classes.
"
27847,"Did Molly say what she had?
"
27848,"Because my throat's been hurting.
"
27849,"Menstrual cramps.
"
27850,"I don't think that's what this is.
"
27851,"- Can any of you watch Emma?
"
27852,"- No, I'm sorry, sweetie.
"
27853,"No, I've got work,
"
27854,"and then I'm proposing.
"
27855,"Great. Shoot.
"
27856,"What am I gonna do?
"
27857,"Well, I could do it.
"
27858,"- Well, actually...
"
27859,"- Can I talk to you for a second?
"
27860,"I do not want her babysitting our child.
"
27861,"- Why not?
"
27862,"- For one thing, she keeps calling her Ella.
"
27863,"- Ella's a nice name.
"
27864,"- Fine, we'll call the next one Ella.
"
27865,"- The next one?
"
27866,"- Okay.
"
27867,"I don't want her watching our baby.
"
27868,"Ross, I am trying to help her
"
27869,"become a better person.
"
27870,"This is a huge breakthrough for her.
"
27871,"She just offered to do something
"
27872,"for another human being.
"
27873,"You know, I don't know.
"
27874,"Ross, I'm telling you...
"
27875,"...she's giving up getting her eyebrows
"
27876,"shaped to do this, all right?
"
27877,"Do you understand how important
"
27878,"that is in our world?
"
27879,"Listen, I couldn't help but overhear,
"
27880,"because I was trying to.
"
27881,"Listen, let me do this.
"
27882,"I really want to help you guys out.
"
27883,"And plus, Rachel's been
"
27884,"so wonderful to me.
"
27885,"- Absolutely.
"
27886,"- Oh, great!
"
27887,"So how much does it pay?
"
27888,"How's the second draft
"
27889,"of the letter coming?
"
27890,"Great. I'm finished. In fact,
"
27891,"I just dropped it off at the agency.
"
27892,"- You dropped it off?
"
27893,"- Yeah.
"
27894,"Can we read it?
"
27895,"Can you print out another copy?
"
27896,"No can do, amigo.
"
27897,"No, I didn't use the computer.
"
27898,"It felt more personal to handwrite it.
"
27899,"- You handwrote it?
"
27900,"- Yeah, and don't worry.
"
27901,"I didn't try to sound smart at all.
"
27902,"See you later.
"
27903,"Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
"
27904,"That letter is gonna go in our file.
"
27905,"We're never gonna get a kid.
"
27906,"We're gonna be
"
27907,"one of those old couples...
"
27908,"...that collects orchids
"
27909,"or has a lot of birds.
"
27910,"It's okay. You know what?
"
27911,"I will just call the agency
"
27912,"and tell them to throw out the letter.
"
27913,"Okay, good.
"
27914,"Hello, this is Chandler Bing.
"
27915,"Someone just dropped off a handwritten
"
27916,"recommendation letter and...
"
27917,"Okay.
"
27918,"Thank you. Goodbye.
"
27919,"We're screwed, aren't we?
"
27920,"You know what? Just tell me
"
27921,"on the way to the bird store.
"
27922,"- They loved it.
"
27923,"- What?
"
27924,"They thought it was very smart of us
"
27925,"to have a child write the letter.
"
27926,"They thought Joey was a child?
"
27927,"She guessed 8, 9,
"
27928,"based on his drawings.
"
27929,"- Hi.
"
27930,"- Hey, what'd you guys do today?
"
27931,"Ella wanted to go out, so we went
"
27932,"shopping and got some sushi.
"
27933,"- That sounds like fun.
"
27934,"- Yeah, not really.
"
27935,"Babies are dull.
"
27936,"- Hey. Hi, how's my girl?
"
27937,"- I'm fine.
"
27938,"And I got you a present
"
27939,"for letting me stay with you.
"
27940,"- Ready?
"
27941,"- Yeah.
"
27942,"You pierced her ears?
"
27943,"Doesn't it make her nose look smaller?
"
27944,"You pierced her ears?
"
27945,"How could you do this
"
27946,"without telling me?
"
27947,"If I had told you, then it wouldn't
"
27948,"have been a surprise, now would it?
"
27949,"I think she looks cute.
"
27950,"But I am wrong.
"
27951,"Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
"
27952,"Here comes Ross. He's gonna flip out.
"
27953,"Why, did something happen
"
27954,"to his falafel cart?
"
27955,"- Hey, guys.
"
27956,"- Ross!
"
27957,"Hi, Emma.
"
27958,"Why is she wearing her hat so low?
"
27959,"- She can barely see.
"
27960,"- I don't really want her to see.
"
27961,"Why not?
"
27962,"Because there are so many
"
27963,"terrible sights in this world.
"
27964,"Like war. Or that thing
"
27965,"in Joey's refrigerator. Remember?
"
27966,"It was in a milk carton,
"
27967,"but it looked like meat?
"
27968,"Come here. Come here.
"
27969,"There she is. Hi.
"
27970,"- What?
"
27971,"- Nothing.
"
27972,"Hi.
"
27973,"What...?
"
27974,"- Please tell me those are clip-ons!
"
27975,"- Oh, they're real.
"
27976,"Did she do this to her?
"
27977,"I told you we shouldn't have
"
27978,"left Emma with her!
"
27979,"I know, I know.
"
27980,"And you were right, Ross.
"
27981,"Okay? You are so irresponsible!
"
27982,"I am never letting you babysit again!
"
27983,"You know what?
"
27984,"This kid needs me, okay?
"
27985,"- She needs to have a cool, fun aunt.
"
27986,"- I'm a cool, fun aunt.
"
27987,"Okay.
"
27988,"Hey! Monica can be cool and fun
"
27989,"at organized indoor projects.
"
27990,"All I wanted to do was help you try
"
27991,"to figure out what to do with your life.
"
27992,"This is how you repay me?
"
27993,"I don't need you to help me. I already
"
27994,"know what I'm gonna do with my life.
"
27995,"- Oh, yeah? Since when?
"
27996,"- Since today.
"
27997,"I am going to be a baby stylist.
"
27998,"- What?
"
27999,"- That's not a thing!
"
28000,"Well, it should be.
"
28001,"I'm gonna help babies learn
"
28002,"how to accessorize...
"
28003,"...what colors to wear,
"
28004,"what clothes are slimming.
"
28005,"- Babies don't care if they're slim!
"
28006,"- Enter Amy.
"
28007,"- Amy, l... I just... I just wanna...
"
28008,"- What? What are you gonna do?
"
28009,"No more falafel for you!
"
28010,"Great game, huh?
"
28011,"- Why do you keep looking at the screen?
"
28012,"- I'm not. I'm praying.
"
28013,"Please let the Knicks win.
"
28014,"Thank you, Thor.
"
28015,"- Where are you going?
"
28016,"- I'm going to the bathroom.
"
28017,"- Well, I think you should wait.
"
28018,"- Why?
"
28019,"Well, if you don't hold it in,
"
28020,"you don't get all the nutrients.
"
28021,"Knicks fans, please turn your attention
"
28022,"to the big screen on the scoreboard.
"
28023,"Someone has a special question to ask.
"
28024,"Mike Hannigan, will you marry me?
"
28025,"Get a load of this.
"
28026,"She's proposing to him!
"
28027,"Guess we know who wears
"
28028,"the pants in that family.
"
28029,"Well, that's not very enlightened.
"
28030,"Boo us? Boo you!
"
28031,"Hello?
"
28032,"Yeah, this is Joey Tribbiani.
"
28033,"Oh, hi.
"
28034,"Well, I'm glad you liked my letter.
"
28035,"No, my mommy and daddy
"
28036,"aren't home right now.
"
28037,"Okay, bye-bye.
"
28038,"She was nice.
"
28039,"Joey, get Amy's bags.
"
28040,"She is moving out.
"
28041,"- You're kicking me out?
"
28042,"- You put holes in my baby's ears.
"
28043,"At least now people
"
28044,"will know she's a girl!
"
28045,"I can't believe I ever
"
28046,"even tried to help you.
"
28047,"- You are so beyond help!
"
28048,"- You know what?
"
28049,"Ever since I got here,
"
28050,"you have been nothing but negative.
"
28051,"- Excuse me?
"
28052,"- You didn't want me...
"
28053,"...to marry the old guy
"
28054,"with the great apartment.
"
28055,"Then I tried to help your daughter
"
28056,"de-emphasize her flaws...
"
28057,"...and suddenly I'm the bad guy?
"
28058,"- Joey, where are those bags?
"
28059,"- She has a lot of crap!
"
28060,"You know? When I moved in here,
"
28061,"I thought, ""This will be so great.
"
28062,"Just us sisters back together again
"
28063,"like when we were kids.""
"
28064,"Except without that stupid Jill.
"
28065,"Who has gotten fat, by the way.
"
28066,"Seriously?
"
28067,"Mom said she gained, like, 15 pounds.
"
28068,"- Hips or thighs?
"
28069,"- Ass and face.
"
28070,"Oh, my God!
"
28071,"I thought she was on Atkins.
"
28072,"She was. Carbs found her.
"
28073,"See? This is what I wanted.
"
28074,"Two sisters talking about real stuff.
"
28075,"Oh, I can give you that.
"
28076,"- You can?
"
28077,"- Yeah.
"
28078,"I kept trying to make you
"
28079,"a better person, but you're...
"
28080,"You're already a pretty perfect
"
28081,"version of what you are.
"
28082,"Thank you.
"
28083,"You gotta admit,
"
28084,"Emma does look cute.
"
28085,"- Did you just say, ""Emma""?
"
28086,"- Oh, I'm sorry. Ella.
"
28087,"That woman didn't know what
"
28088,"she was talking about, Mike.
"
28089,"Obviously, you have balls.
"
28090,"- Please, let's forget the whole thing.
"
28091,"- I would love it.
"
28092,"- Consider it forgotten.
"
28093,"- Thank you.
"
28094,"But just so you know...
"
28095,"However and whenever you decide
"
28096,"to propose, I promise I'll say yes.
"
28097,"Whether, you know,
"
28098,"it's at a basketball game...
"
28099,"...or in skywriting...
"
28100,"...or, you know, like some lame
"
28101,"guy in a cheesy movie...
"
28102,"...who hides it in the cake.
"
28103,"It's in the cake, isn't it?
"
28104,"Where else would lame
"
28105,"Mr. No Balls hide it?
"
28106,"What's the matter with me?
"
28107,"Why do I keep ruining this?
"
28108,"- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
"
28109,"- No, it's my fault.
"
28110,"I keep trying to propose
"
28111,"in these stupid ways...
"
28112,"...and I just wanna tell you I love you,
"
28113,"and I wanna spend my life with you...
"
28114,"- I'm gonna do this now.
"
28115,"- Oh, my God.
"
28116,"- Phoebe, l...
"
28117,"- Wait. Oh, wait.
"
28118,"Ready? Okay.
"
28119,"Phoebe, I love you.
"
28120,"There's no one else in the world I would
"
28121,"ask to marry me three times.
"
28122,"But I want to take care of you...
"
28123,"...have babies with you...
"
28124,"...and grow old with you.
"
28125,"Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me?
"
28126,"Yes.
"
28127,"- I love you.
"
28128,"- I love you more.
"
28129,"Not possible.
"
28130,"She's gonna be Mrs. No Balls!
"
28131,"So how's the baby-styling
"
28132,"business going?
"
28133,"Not that great.
"
28134,"It's almost as if people don't want
"
28135,"to hear that their babies are ugly.
"
28136,"That's shocking.
"
28137,"There's Ross. Hey, Ross.
"
28138,"Hello, Ross?
"
28139,"He's rude.

"
28195,"Then I'll tell you. My agency was bidding

"

28218,"When I'm not busy thinking
"
28219,"of important things, or professing...
"
28220,"...I like to use...
"
28221,"What's the product?
"
28222,"Software that facilitates
"
28223,"inter-business networking e-solutions.
"
28224,"I'm cold.
"
28225,"- Hey.
"
28226,"- Hey.
"
28227,"Guess who's a finalist
"
28228,"for a huge research grant?
"
28229,"I'll give you a hint.
"
28230,"He's looking right at you.
"
28231,"Well, unless it's the creepy guy
"
28232,"with his hand up his kilt...
"
28233,"...I'm gonna say, ""Congratulations.""
"
28234,"I'm so excited. Apparently, I beat out
"
28235,"hundreds of other applicants...
"
28236,"...including five guys
"
28237,"I went to graduate school with.
"
28238,"Not that I'm keeping score,
"
28239,"or anything. Five.
"
28240,"- Wow, that's great.
"
28241,"- Yeah.
"
28242,"- So tell me about the grant.
"
28243,"- Well, okay, it's for $25,000.
"
28244,"And if I get it, I'll be able
"
28245,"to complete my field research.
"
28246,"And there will be an article about me
"
28247,"in the Paleontology Review.
"
28248,"It'll be the first time
"
28249,"my name is in there...
"
28250,"...without people raising
"
28251,"serious questions about my work.
"
28252,"- Are you talking about the Dewer Grant?
"
28253,"- Yeah. Why?
"
28254,"Benjamin Hobart
"
28255,"is administering that grant.
"
28256,"- Your ex-boyfriend?
"
28257,"- Yeah.
"
28258,"So your ex-boyfriend is gonna determine
"
28259,"if your new boyfriend gets this grant?
"
28260,"Wow, your new boyfriend is screwed.
"
28261,"No. No, we ended on great terms.
"
28262,"If anything, I think this could
"
28263,"help you. You know what?
"
28264,"Why don't we all go out to dinner,
"
28265,"and I can introduce you.
"
28266,"- lf you think it'd help.
"
28267,"- Yeah, absolutely. I'll call him.
"
28268,"Now, is there anything I could
"
28269,"do to butter him up?
"
28270,"Anything he really likes?
"
28271,"He does have
"
28272,"a pretty serious latex fetish.
"
28273,"We'll see how dinner goes.
"
28274,"- Hey.
"
28275,"- Hey, you want to go see a movie?
"
28276,"I told you I had to spend all day
"
28277,"clearing out stuff so Mike could move in.
"
28278,"- Oh, right.
"
28279,"- Yeah.
"
28280,"Now that I'm here, I might as well help
"
28281,"with the cleaning and organizing.
"
28282,"I just happen to have my label maker.
"
28283,"Oh, it's so hard to get rid of stuff.
"
28284,"Did you and Chandler make compromises
"
28285,"when you moved in together?
"
28286,"Chandler did.
"
28287,"- What does he want you to give up?
"
28288,"- A bunch of stuff.
"
28289,"And the worst one,
"
28290,"he wants me to get rid of Gladys.
"
28291,"Who's Gladys?
"
28292,"Oh, what a tragic loss.
"
28293,"Yeah, I really hate to give her up.
"
28294,"Oh, I know. Oh, you should take her.
"
28295,"Oh, I don't know.
"
28296,"- What, you don't like her?
"
28297,"- Of course I do. What's not to like?
"
28298,"I'd take her in a minute.
"
28299,"But I think that you're
"
28300,"giving up too easy.
"
28301,"I think that you need
"
28302,"to fight for her.
"
28303,"- Really, you think?
"
28304,"- Absolutely.
"
28305,"You say to him, ""I'm sorry, Mike,
"
28306,"I can't live without her.
"
28307,"She means too much to me.""
"
28308,"Okay, I'll fight for her. Okay.
"
28309,"Oh, wait. I just realized, if I do that,
"
28310,"that means you don't get her.
"
28311,"Damn it, I did not think this through.
"
28312,"- Hey, guys.
"
28313,"- Hi.
"
28314,"Oh, any word on casting yet?
"
28315,"- I told you, you're not right for the part.
"
28316,"- What do you mean?
"
28317,"Rach, don't I seem like a professor
"
28318,"you'd buy some kind of e-crap from?
"
28319,"I'm sorry, this sounds like something
"
28320,"I'm never gonna be interested in.
"
28321,"Look, come on, please? It's not like
"
28322,"I'm asking you for some crazy favor.
"
28323,"This is what I do for a living.
"
28324,"I am a professional actor.
"
28325,"Man, I'm two hours late for work.
"
28326,"Here's my reel. It's got all
"
28327,"the commercials that I've been in.
"
28328,"- Joe...
"
28329,"- Just watch it.
"
28330,"If you don't like it,
"
28331,"don't pass it on to your bosses.
"
28332,"- Fine.
"
28333,"- Thank you.
"
28334,"- Work, Joe.
"
28335,"- Damn it.
"
28336,"- What am I gonna do now?
"
28337,"- Just pass the tape along.
"
28338,"He's not right for the part.
"
28339,"If I suggest him,
"
28340,"my bosses will think I'm an idiot.
"
28341,"And that's something
"
28342,"they should learn on their own.
"
28343,"Just tell Joey
"
28344,"that you watched the tape...
"
28345,"...and you liked it,
"
28346,"but your bosses didn't.
"
28347,"Then you're the good guy,
"
28348,"and they're the bad guy.
"
28349,"That's good. I liked it, they didn't.
"
28350,"Joey, for God's sake, go to work.
"
28351,"I can't believe I'm about
"
28352,"to meet Benjamin Hobart.
"
28353,"I've always thought of him
"
28354,"as someone I'd invite...
"
28355,"...to my fantasy dinner party.
"
28356,"Do you think there's any chance
"
28357,"he'll bring Christie Brinkley or C-3PO?
"
28358,"Sorry, it looks like it's just him.
"
28359,"Charlie.
"
28360,"My God, you look absolutely stunning.
"
28361,"Well, I am having a good hair day.
"
28362,"- It's so good to see you.
"
28363,"- Oh, you too.
"
28364,"I'm okay.
"
28365,"I'm sorry. Ross Geller,
"
28366,"Benjamin Hobart.
"
28367,"It's an honor to meet you.
"
28368,"I can't tell you how long...
"
28369,"...I've been an admirer of your work.
"
28370,"I mean, that Nobel Prize.
"
28371,"I mean, I have to tell you that you're
"
28372,"one of the reasons I got into the field.
"
28373,"Well, likewise.
"
28374,"Not likewise. I'd never heard
"
28375,"of you until this morning.
"
28376,"But it's nice to be nice.
"
28377,"- Shall we?
"
28378,"- Yeah. Thank you.
"
28379,"I can't believe that you chose
"
28380,"this restaurant.
"
28381,"- Do you remember the night?
"
28382,"- Oh, my God. I completely forgot.
"
28383,"Oh, my God, I can't believe
"
28384,"they let us back in this place.
"
28385,"You weren't there.
"
28386,"No, but, you know,
"
28387,"it's just a funny image.
"
28388,"You know, the two of you
"
28389,"in this restaurant with the...
"
28390,"Why don't you tell Benji about your
"
28391,"proposal while I go to the ladies' room.
"
28392,"So tell me about it.
"
28393,"Okay. Well, I would like to do a dig
"
28394,"in the Painted Desert.
"
28395,"There are still several areas
"
28396,"that haven't been fully excavated.
"
28397,"- Break up with Charlie.
"
28398,"- What?
"
28399,"What?
"
28400,"Did you just say,
"
28401,"""Break up with Charlie""?
"
28402,"Well, yes and no. Yes, I did say it.
"
28403,"And no, I didn't not say it.
"
28404,"- Kind of inappropriate, don't you think?
"
28405,"- Listen, I'm sorry.
"
28406,"I just haven't seen her for so long,
"
28407,"all these feelings are rushing back.
"
28408,"I'm starting to realize
"
28409,"how much I've missed her.
"
28410,"And I'm gonna need you
"
28411,"to break up with her.
"
28412,"- Are you serious?
"
28413,"- lf you say, yes, then I'm serious.
"
28414,"If you say, no, then I'm joking.
"
28415,"- No.
"
28416,"- Joking it is.
"
28417,"- Hi, sorry I'm late.
"
28418,"- Hey, how'd it go with Mike?
"
28419,"- Is he gonna let you keep the painting?
"
28420,"- No, he really hates it.
"
28421,"But he's gonna let me keep
"
28422,"my box of human hair.
"
28423,"So you gotta pick your battles.
"
28424,"But the good news is, Gladys is yours.
"
28425,"Wow, what's the bad news?
"
28426,"- Who's Gladys?
"
28427,"- Oh, she's that work of art I made.
"
28428,"You know, with the woman
"
28429,"coming out of the frame.
"
28430,"And Monica gets to keep her?
"
28431,"In her house? I am so jealous.
"
28432,"I didn't know you wanted her too.
"
28433,"Well, I mean, sure, of course.
"
28434,"But you already gave that
"
28435,"to Monica, so...
"
28436,"- You know, I would give her up for you.
"
28437,"- No, I couldn't let you do that.
"
28438,"- No, but I want to.
"
28439,"- But I don't want you to.
"
28440,"- But I insist.
"
28441,"- But I insist harder.
"
28442,"Girls. Girls. Stop.
"
28443,"Okay, we'll flip a coin.
"
28444,"Heads, she's Rachel's.
"
28445,"Tails, she's Monica's.
"
28446,"- Tails. Monica, she's yours.
"
28447,"- No, that landed in your food.
"
28448,"No, no, that's okay.
"
28449,"You won fair and square. I'm so sad.
"
28450,"- Hey, Joe?
"
28451,"- What's up?
"
28452,"Bad news. I watched the tape
"
28453,"and passed it along to my bosses...
"
28454,"...and they weren't interested.
"
28455,"I'm sorry, man.
"
28456,"- But you watched the tape?
"
28457,"- Yeah, I liked it.
"
28458,"But my bosses didn't go for it.
"
28459,"Stupid sons of bitches.
"
28460,"- You didn't watch the tape.
"
28461,"- What? Of course I did.
"
28462,"Look, it's one thing not to cast me,
"
28463,"but to lie to me?
"
28464,"- I'm not lying to you. I watched it.
"
28465,"- You lied again.
"
28466,"- I watched it.
"
28467,"- Keep going, Pinocchio.
"
28468,"- I did.
"
28469,"- No, you didn't.
"
28470,"I'm telling you, I watched the tape.
"
28471,"- Did you watch the tape?
"
28472,"- No.
"
28473,"The selection committee has chosen
"
28474,"the three of you as our finalists.
"
28475,"The decision will be based on the
"
28476,"answers you give to the questions I ask.
"
28477,"We'll start with Dr. Li.
"
28478,"You claim the field is too reliant...
"
28479,"...on the Linnaean taxonomic system.
"
28480,"How do you propose to correct this?
"
28481,"I believe that the answers lie
"
28482,"in the osteological evidence.
"
28483,"- I plan to begin there.
"
28484,"- Interesting.
"
28485,"I guess.
"
28486,"Dr. Biely, your proposal includes some
"
28487,"fieldwork. Where might that take place?
"
28488,"Primarily in the Pierre Shale region
"
28489,"of South Dakota.
"
28490,"Certainly. Very well.
"
28491,"And Dr. Geller, when is my birthday?
"
28492,"What? l...
"
28493,"Care to venture a guess?
"
28494,"- May 12?
"
28495,"- That's not even kind of close.
"
28496,"Dr. Li, how many graduate students
"
28497,"will you need?
"
28498,"- Half a dozen.
"
28499,"- I see. And Dr. Biely?
"
28500,"Three for excavation,
"
28501,"and two for analysis.
"
28502,"Certainly. Dr. Geller,
"
28503,"which 1965 Shirelles hit...
"
28504,"...was later covered by
"
28505,"a popular British Invasion band?
"
28506,"What? I need six graduate students.
"
28507,"No, I'm sorry.
"
28508,"We were looking for ""Baby It's You.""
"
28509,"""Baby It's You.""
"
28510,"What? Wait just a minute.
"
28511,"None of my questions have anything
"
28512,"to do with paleontology.
"
28513,"You're right, I apologize.
"
28514,"Scratch the last question.
"
28515,"Spell ""Boscodictiasaur.""
"
28516,"I've never heard
"
28517,"of a ""Boscodictiasaur.""
"
28518,"Yeah, I just made it up. Spell it.
"
28519,"- Okay. B-O...
"
28520,"- No, it starts with a silent M.
"
28521,"Oh, come on!
"
28522,"I can't believe Joey.
"
28523,"I hate being called a liar.
"
28524,"But you are a liar.
"
28525,"What did I just say?
"
28526,"- Are you still here?
"
28527,"- Yes.
"
28528,"And I'm not just hurt, I'm insulted.
"
28529,"When I tell somebody I did something...
"
28530,"Okay, hold on, let me just stop you
"
28531,"right there, okay? First, you lied. Right?
"
28532,"Then you lied about lying, okay?
"
28533,"Then you lied about lying
"
28534,"about lying, okay?
"
28535,"So before you lie about lying
"
28536,"about lying about lying about lying...
"
28537,"Stop lying.
"
28538,"Why are you so sure
"
28539,"I didn't watch this tape?
"
28540,"You wanna know why?
"
28541,"You wanna know why?
"
28542,"Well, this is going well.
"
28543,"Here's how I know.
"
28544,"If you had seen what was on this tape,
"
28545,"believe me, you'd have some comments.
"
28546,"All right, remember,
"
28547,"I got paid a lot of money for this...
"
28548,"...and it only aired in Japan.
"
28549,"Ichiban.
"
28550,"Ichiban, lipstick for men.
"
28551,"Ichiban, lipstick for men.
"
28552,"And that's how I know
"
28553,"you didn't watch the tape.
"
28554,"He really is a chameleon.
"
28555,"Well, Gladys, say hello
"
28556,"to your new home.
"
28557,"- Oh, my.
"
28558,"- Wow.
"
28559,"Oh, she is so nice and big.
"
28560,"Oh, Monica, where are you going
"
28561,"to display Gladys, oh, so proudly?
"
28562,"- I haven't really settled on a spot yet.
"
28563,"- How about right above the TV?
"
28564,"That way, it will be the first thing
"
28565,"that you see when you walk in the door.
"
28566,"Yeah, yeah, and you can get rid
"
28567,"of that French poster.
"
28568,"- I like that poster.
"
28569,"- Really?
"
28570,"It doesn't have anything
"
28571,"coming out of it.
"
28572,"Or maybe there's someplace
"
28573,"for her in your bedroom?
"
28574,"- There's nothing above your bed.
"
28575,"- Are you still here?
"
28576,"Oh, hi. Hello.
"
28577,"Have you come to ask me some more
"
28578,"paleontology-related questions?
"
28579,"Your grandmother's nickname, perhaps?
"
28580,"Ann-Margaret's pant size?
"
28581,"I've come here to apologize.
"
28582,"I think I may have let my feelings...
"
28583,"...for Charlie interfere
"
28584,"with the interview process.
"
28585,"No. Stop!
"
28586,"Anyway, I decided
"
28587,"to offer you the grant.
"
28588,"- Really?
"
28589,"- There is just one small stipulation.
"
28590,"- I have to break up with Charlie?
"
28591,"- Hey, you got one right.
"
28592,"- You're crazy.
"
28593,"- Crazy or romantic?
"
28594,"Crazy.
"
28595,"- Or?
"
28596,"- Get out!
"
28597,"Oh, my God.
"
28598,"- What?
"
28599,"- Joey, what is this thing doing here?
"
28600,"I got her from Monica. She sold it
"
28601,"to me for a very reasonable price.
"
28602,"- Joey, we're not keeping this.
"
28603,"- But it's an original Buffay.
"
28604,"All right, fine. You can keep it.
"
28605,"As long as you don't mind
"
28606,"that she's haunted.
"
28607,"Hey, what? What?
"
28608,"Well, legend has it, Joey, that she
"
28609,"comes alive when you're asleep.
"
28610,"She climbs out of the frame...
"
28611,"...and then drags her half-a-body
"
28612,"across the floor...
"
28613,"...just looking for legs to steal.
"
28614,"And then with her one good hand...
"
28615,"...she slowly reaches up...
"
28616,"...and turns your doorknob.
"
28617,"Get that legless witch out of here!
"
28618,"- Hey, I sold that to Joey.
"
28619,"- Yeah, well, I told him it's haunted.
"
28620,"- Two can play at this game.
"
28621,"- Too late. You can't give it back.
"
28622,"- Oh, yes, I can.
"
28623,"- No, you can't, she's yours.
"
28624,"- She's yours.
"
28625,"- She's yours.
"
28626,"- She's yours.
"
28627,"- Hey.
"
28628,"- She's mine.
"
28629,"- She's mine.
"
28630,"- She's mine.
"
28631,"- She's mine.
"
28632,"You guys, you don't have
"
28633,"to fight over her anymore.
"
28634,"Whoever doesn't get Gladys,
"
28635,"gets Glynnis.
"
28636,"- I want Gladys.
"
28637,"- She's mine.
"
28638,"- She's mine.
"
28639,"- She's mine.
"
28640,"Look, I'm sorry
"
28641,"I didn't give them your tape.
"
28642,"And I promise next time to submit you,
"
28643,"whether I think you're right or not.
"
28644,"That's not the point, Chandler.
"
28645,"The point is that you lied.
"
28646,"I know. You're right. What's it
"
28647,"gonna take for you to forgive me?
"
28648,"Oh, my God.
"
28649,"Excellent.
"
28650,"Now what do you say?
"
28651,"Lying is wrong.
"
28652,"And? And?!
"
28653,"I'm a pretty little girl.
"
28654,"I knew it.
"
28655,"Your ex-boyfriend is insane.
"
28656,"- Did you get the grant?
"
28657,"- No. And you wanna know why?
"
28658,"Because your ex-boyfriend
"
28659,"is still in love with you.
"
28660,"What?
"
28661,"He refused me
"
28662,"because I wouldn't give you up.
"
28663,"Benji isn't in love with me.
"
28664,"I mean, he broke up with me.
"
28665,"- And besides, he's a very ethical man.
"
28666,"- Really?
"
28667,"Is it ethical to ask someone
"
28668,"in a grant review:
"
28669,"""Who was the voice of Underdog?""
"
28670,"I'm sure he was just joking.
"
28671,"If you don't believe me,
"
28672,"let's go talk to him.
"
28673,"I'm telling you, he didn't ask me
"
28674,"one paleontological question.
"
28675,"- Seriously?
"
28676,"- Oh, I'm sorry. No, he did ask me one:
"
28677,"""How do you spell Boscodictiasaur?""
"
28678,"Well, if it's like the Lake Mbosco
"
28679,"in Congo, then M-B-O...
"
28680,"Damn it.
"
28681,"Dr. Geller. Charlie, what are
"
28682,"you doing here?
"
28683,"I want you to tell her everything.
"
28684,"About the deal you tried to make
"
28685,"with me, about the crazy questions you...
"
28686,"Wally Cox.
"
28687,"That's the voice of Underdog.
"
28688,"Like I tried to tell you
"
28689,"in the interview...
"
28690,"...this grant is not based on your
"
28691,"knowledge of pretty useless trivia.
"
28692,"No, don't do that. I want you to look
"
28693,"her in the eyes and tell her the truth.
"
28694,"Benji?
"
28695,"It's true. I behaved horribly,
"
28696,"but it's only because I still love you.
"
28697,"And I would do anything
"
28698,"to have you back in my life.
"
28699,"Too little, too late, Benji.
"
28700,"- I can't believe this.
"
28701,"- I never should've broken up with you.
"
28702,"I think about you all the time.
"
28703,"Do you ever still think about me?
"
28704,"No.
"
28705,"- Yes.
"
28706,"- What?
"
28707,"I don't know what to say, Benji.
"
28708,"This is all so...
"
28709,"...romantic.
"
28710,"Or?
"
28711,"I know I may be
"
28712,"way out of bounds here...
"
28713,"...but is there any chance
"
28714,"you would take me back?
"
28715,"Maybe.
"
28716,"Sweetie, this conversation is starting
"
28717,"to make me a little uncomfortable.
"
28718,"Oh, God. I am so sorry, but...
"
28719,"I mean, there's so much history
"
28720,"between us, you know?
"
28721,"I'm sorry too.
"
28722,"- I love you.
"
28723,"- I love you too.
"
28724,"Okay, that's it,
"
28725,"we are seeing other people.
"
28726,"Gladys?
"
28727,"For the third time this week.
"
28728,"Man, this does not get old.
"
28729,"- You're mean!
"
28730,"- Oh, don't be such a baby. Please.

"
28735,"Hey, you guys.
"
28736,"Hey, what are you doing?
"
28737,"- Figuring out our wedding plans.
"
28738,"- Funny. We were doing the same thing.
"
28739,"It's really crazy.
"
28740,"The hall, the dress, the food.
"
28741,"- I had no idea how expensive this was.
"
28742,"- Yeah, it is really pricey.
"
28743,"- I freaked when I heard the numbers.
"
28744,"- So, what did you two do about it?
"
28745,"It was simple. I came up with
"
28746,"some cost-cutting solutions...
"
28747,"...wrote out a list
"
28748,"and Monica told me to go to hell.
"
28749,"There's no way around it. Just accept
"
28750,"that this is gonna cost a lot of money.
"
28751,"I heard that weddings are, like,
"
28752,"a $40 billion-a-year industry.
"
28753,"Yeah. And I'm responsible
"
28754,"for just, like, half of that.
"
28755,"But really, it does seem like
"
28756,"this money could be put to better use.
"
28757,"Are you serious?
"
28758,"Yeah. How would you feel if we gave
"
28759,"all the wedding money to charity...
"
28760,"...and we just got married
"
28761,"at City Hall?
"
28762,"I think it would make me
"
28763,"wanna marry you even more.
"
28764,"I gotta say, you guys,
"
28765,"that's an incredible gesture.
"
28766,"Maybe you do that
"
28767,"next time you get married.
"
28768,"No, no, no. The next time's
"
28769,"gonna be Hawaii at sunset.
"
28770,"But maybe the time after that.
"
28771,"The One With the Home Study
"
28772,"- Hey. What's going on?
"
28773,"- Hey.
"
28774,"Our adoption social worker is coming,
"
28775,"so we're cleaning the apartment.
"
28776,"""We""?
"
28777,"You know you don't want me to help.
"
28778,"You can't have it both ways.
"
28779,"Is this the person who decides
"
28780,"whether or not you get a baby?
"
28781,"- She's coming to see where we live.
"
28782,"- And it has to go perfectly.
"
28783,"If she doesn't like us, she can keep
"
28784,"us off every adoption list in the state.
"
28785,"Hey, maybe I should stop by.
"
28786,"She could be a soap opera fan.
"
28787,"It's very impressive when
"
28788,"the little people know a celebrity.
"
28789,"""Little people""?
"
28790,"""Celebrity.""
"
28791,"So I think I'm just about done here.
"
28792,"Unless you have any bad stuff hidden
"
28793,"somewhere, like porn or cigarettes?
"
28794,"What?
"
28795,"- No.
"
28796,"- Chandler.
"
28797,"I don't, and I'm offended
"
28798,"by the insinuation.
"
28799,"So there's not a magazine
"
28800,"under the couch...
"
28801,"...or cigarettes taped to the back
"
28802,"of the toilet tank...
"
28803,"...or a filthy video in the VCR?
"
28804,"I'll admit the cigarettes and magazine.
"
28805,"But that tape is not mine.
"
28806,"- It isn't mine.
"
28807,"- I guess we'll never know whose it is.
"
28808,"May I help you?
"
28809,"We're here to make a rather
"
28810,"sizable donation to the children.
"
28811,"Any contribution, large or small,
"
28812,"is appreciated.
"
28813,"I think you're gonna appreciate
"
28814,"the crap out of this one.
"
28815,"- Well, this is very generous.
"
28816,"- And we don't want any recognition.
"
28817,"This is completely anonymous.
"
28818,"Completely anonymous.
"
28819,"From two kind strangers.
"
28820,"Mr. X and Phoebe Buffay.
"
28821,"We can put your names
"
28822,"in our newsletter.
"
28823,"- Not necessary.
"
28824,"- Buffay is spelled B-U-F-F-A-Y.
"
28825,"And X is spelled ""Mike Hannigan.""
"
28826,"Well, on behalf of the children,
"
28827,"thank you both very much.
"
28828,"- I'm glad we did this. It feels so good.
"
28829,"- It does. It feels really good.
"
28830,"Oh, look. And we get
"
28831,"these free T-shirts.
"
28832,"Actually, that's the shirt
"
28833,"I wore to the gym.
"
28834,"It's moist.
"
28835,"- Hi. Emma will be up in a minute.
"
28836,"- Oh, good.
"
28837,"Hey, Ross, listen. I heard about
"
28838,"you and Charlie. I'm really sorry.
"
28839,"That's okay. I'm sure there are tons of
"
28840,"other beautiful paleontologists out there.
"
28841,"- Absolutely.
"
28842,"- There was one. She's it.
"
28843,"All the rest look like
"
28844,"they should live under a bridge.
"
28845,"So, what are you gonna do today?
"
28846,"I was thinking of taking Emma
"
28847,"to the playground.
"
28848,"Oh, my God. What?
"
28849,"Like I said, I was thinking of taking
"
28850,"Emma to the Museum of Knives and Fire.
"
28851,"Okay, look, Ross. I do not want
"
28852,"Emma going to the playground.
"
28853,"Because...?
"
28854,"All right, if you must know,
"
28855,"I had a traumatic...
"
28856,"...swing incident when I was little.
"
28857,"- Seriously?
"
28858,"- Yes. I was 4 years old.
"
28859,"And I was on the swing...
"
28860,"...and then all of a sudden my hair
"
28861,"got tangled in the chain.
"
28862,"And to get me out, my mom had
"
28863,"to cut a big chunk of my hair.
"
28864,"And it was uneven for weeks.
"
28865,"And you made it through that?
"
28866,"I wonder who's gonna play you
"
28867,"in the movie.
"
28868,"Okay, fine, you can make fun of me.
"
28869,"I do not want Emma going there.
"
28870,"And I was thinking Claire Danes.
"
28871,"Look, I'm sorry to hear
"
28872,"about your tragedy.
"
28873,"But the swings are perfectly safe.
"
28874,"And besides, Emma loves them.
"
28875,"- You should come, and you'll see.
"
28876,"- Those things go, like, 40 miles an hour.
"
28877,"And there's that moment
"
28878,"when you're at the top...
"
28879,"...when you just don't know
"
28880,"if you're gonna return back to Earth.
"
28881,"Space is filled with orbiting children.
"
28882,"Look, please, just come on.
"
28883,"When you see the look on Emma's face,
"
28884,"I swear, you won't regret it.
"
28885,"- All right.
"
28886,"- Good.
"
28887,"You don't wanna be a mom who passes
"
28888,"her irrational fears to her children.
"
28889,"""Irrational,"" huh?
"
28890,"I'll remember that next time you freak
"
28891,"out about a spider in your apartment.
"
28892,"That's the same. I'm sure there are 30
"
28893,"different species of poisonous swings.
"
28894,"Oh, my God.
"
28895,"The adoption lady is early.
"
28896,"Okay. Okay. Here we go.
"
28897,"Here we go.
"
28898,"Stand up straight.
"
28899,"Big smile.
"
28900,"Hello. Is this the Creepy residence?
"
28901,"We're waiting for the adoption lady.
"
28902,"But I'm glad you're here.
"
28903,"I was cleaning this morning
"
28904,"and I found this.
"
28905,"I don't know
"
28906,"if you wanna use it, but...
"
28907,"Oh, this is so sweet of you.
"
28908,"But I won't be needing a veil.
"
28909,"I actually won't be wearing a dress at all.
"
28910,"I told you, I am not coming
"
28911,"to a naked wedding!
"
28912,"No. We're not having a big reception.
"
28913,"We took the wedding money
"
28914,"and donated it to a children's charity.
"
28915,"That's crazy!
"
28916,"I'm sorry. I can't imagine giving up
"
28917,"my one wedding day like that.
"
28918,"Well, we're different.
"
28919,"I don't care about having a huge party.
"
28920,"This is really nice for you, but...
"
28921,"Oh, please. I put this on
"
28922,"and I just look like...
"
28923,"Well, radiant.
"
28924,"All right, but who cares? I don't need
"
28925,"a pretty veil and a fancy dress.
"
28926,"That's right.
"
28927,"You're making a commitment.
"
28928,"You know, that's the same
"
28929,"whether you do it at the Plaza or...
"
28930,"- Where you gonna do it?
"
28931,"- City Hall.
"
28932,"Oh, that sounds nice.
"
28933,"I was just there for jury duty.
"
28934,"They've really spruced that place up.
"
28935,"Okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.
"
28936,"I've made my decision.
"
28937,"What I really want
"
28938,"is a great big wedding.
"
28939,"- But you gave all the money to charity.
"
28940,"- Well, I'll just ask for it back.
"
28941,"- I don't think you can do that.
"
28942,"- Why not?
"
28943,"This is her wedding day. That's way
"
28944,"more important than some stupid kids.
"
28945,"That's sweet, honey, but save
"
28946,"something for the adoption lady.
"
28947,"- All right, okay. Be careful.
"
28948,"- Okay.
"
28949,"Careful. Watch her hair.
"
28950,"Watch her hair!
"
28951,"- Rach, she's got, like, three hairs.
"
28952,"- I know. I know.
"
28953,"But they're just so beautiful.
"
28954,"Oh, my God, I just pulled one out.
"
28955,"I promise you she's safe.
"
28956,"Watch how much she loves this.
"
28957,"- Okay. Okay.
"
28958,"- Are you ready, sweetie? Here we go.
"
28959,"Okay, careful. Okay.
"
28960,"She's smiling.
"
28961,"Look at that, she does like it.
"
28962,"See, I told you.
"
28963,"Oh, my God. Look at her,
"
28964,"she's a little daredevil.
"
28965,"- Oh, God. Let me push. Can I push?
"
28966,"- Oh, absolutely.
"
28967,"Oh, God. Okay, get the camera.
"
28968,"It's in the diaper bag.
"
28969,"Okay.
"
28970,"See? Scared of the swings.
"
28971,"I bet you feel pretty silly.
"
28972,"- We're asking for the money back?
"
28973,"- It's for our wedding day.
"
28974,"Now, is this guy gay or straight?
"
28975,"Because one of us has to start flirting.
"
28976,"You here to make another
"
28977,"donation the same day?
"
28978,"I don't think that's ever
"
28979,"happened before.
"
28980,"Gay. Go.
"
28981,"Oh, my God, I love your shirt.
"
28982,"The donation we made earlier?
"
28983,"Well, we want it back.
"
28984,"Excuse me?
"
28985,"Okay, that money was for a big wedding
"
28986,"we thought we didn't want.
"
28987,"But it turns out we do.
"
28988,"So you're asking us to refund
"
28989,"your donation to the children?
"
28990,"Yeah.
"
28991,"This feels really good.
"
28992,"I'm sorry. I am. But this wedding's
"
28993,"just really important to me.
"
28994,"Hey, it's none of my business.
"
28995,"Besides, this is probably a good thing.
"
28996,"We've really been spoiling the children,
"
28997,"what with all the food and warm clothing.
"
28998,"That's not fair.
"
28999,"A person's wedding is important.
"
29000,"And especially to me.
"
29001,"I didn't have a graduation party.
"
29002,"And I didn't go to prom.
"
29003,"And I spent my sweet 16
"
29004,"being chased around a tire yard...
"
29005,"...by an escaped mental patient who,
"
29006,"in his own words, wanted to:
"
29007,"""Kill me, or whatever.""
"
29008,"So I deserve a real celebration.
"
29009,"And I'm not gonna let some sweaty
"
29010,"little man make me feel badly about it.
"
29011,"She could've been talking about
"
29012,"either one of us.
"
29013,"Hi, I'm Laura.
"
29014,"I'm here for your adoption interview.
"
29015,"Hi, I'm Monica.
"
29016,"And this is Chandler.
"
29017,"- Please come in.
"
29018,"- Thank you.
"
29019,"- Would you like something to drink?
"
29020,"- Water would be fine.
"
29021,"We're so glad that you're here.
"
29022,"We're excited about
"
29023,"getting this process started.
"
29024,"Because we love kids.
"
29025,"Love them to death.
"
29026,"Well, not actually to death.
"
29027,"That's just a figure of speech.
"
29028,"We love kids the appropriate amount...
"
29029,"...as allowed by law.
"
29030,"- Your place is just lovely.
"
29031,"- Thank you.
"
29032,"Yes, this building does have
"
29033,"a wholesome, family feel to it.
"
29034,"I feel like I've been here before. Any
"
29035,"other couples in the building adopting?
"
29036,"Is that that couple on the first floor?
"
29037,"We should get a baby before them.
"
29038,"That guy tried to sell me drugs.
"
29039,"But other than that,
"
29040,"wholesome, wholesome building.
"
29041,"- What?
"
29042,"- I realized why I remember this place.
"
29043,"- Really? What is it?
"
29044,"- Oh, it's nothing.
"
29045,"I went on a date with a guy who lived
"
29046,"in this building. It didn't end very well.
"
29047,"That wouldn't, by any chance,
"
29048,"be Joey Tribbiani?
"
29049,"- Yes!
"
29050,"- Of course it was.
"
29051,"We had a great night. In the morning,
"
29052,"he promised he'd call and he didn't.
"
29053,"Rat bastard!
"
29054,"- So you're not friends with him?
"
29055,"- Oh, God, no.
"
29056,"- No, no, no.
"
29057,"- No. Nope.
"
29058,"Well, I'm sorry I brought it up.
"
29059,"So are either one of you planning
"
29060,"on staying at home?
"
29061,"Hello?
"
29062,"Anybody in there order a celebrity?
"
29063,"What was that?
"
29064,"That's just some crazy guy
"
29065,"who roams the halls here.
"
29066,"He's great with kids, though.
"
29067,"- Ross. Oh, my God, are you okay?
"
29068,"- Son of a bitch!
"
29069,"Oh, relax. I didn't say the F-word.
"
29070,"Ross, see, I told you!
"
29071,"Those swings are evil!
"
29072,"That's the last time Emma is getting on
"
29073,"one of those things for her entire life.
"
29074,"No, no, no. Okay, it wasn't
"
29075,"the swing's fault. It was my fault.
"
29076,"And kind of that kid's fault.
"
29077,"Who is still laughing. Nice.
"
29078,"Come on. Can we just get out of here
"
29079,"before somebody else gets hurt?
"
29080,"No. Wait. I have an idea.
"
29081,"I want you to get on the swing...
"
29082,"...and you'll see that there's
"
29083,"nothing to be afraid of.
"
29084,"I know what this is all about.
"
29085,"You've always been jealous of my hair.
"
29086,"I just think you're an adult, okay?
"
29087,"And you should get over your silly fears.
"
29088,"- All right, fine. I'll do it.
"
29089,"- Good.
"
29090,"- lf you hold a spider.
"
29091,"- Where?! Where?!
"
29092,"If you hold a spider.
"
29093,"I know.
"
29094,"Guys, is everything okay?
"
29095,"It's me, Joey.
"
29096,"Adoption!
"
29097,"What's going on?
"
29098,"Oh, it's just like I said, that crazy...
"
29099,"...Bert, roaming the halls.
"
29100,"- Guys?
"
29101,"- Keep on roaming, Bert!
"
29102,"We don't want any crazy today!
"
29103,"- What's going on?
"
29104,"- We'll talk later! Everything's fine!
"
29105,"Everything doesn't sound fine.
"
29106,"Is he all right out there by himself?
"
29107,"Oh, yeah. He has a caretaker.
"
29108,"His older brother...
"
29109,"...Ernie.
"
29110,"- Bert and Ernie?
"
29111,"- You can't make this stuff up.
"
29112,"You never told me about that guy
"
29113,"and your sweet 16.
"
29114,"- I'm sorry about that.
"
29115,"- Oh, it ended okay.
"
29116,"One of my friends shot him.
"
29117,"At least you'll get a proper wedding.
"
29118,"You really deserve that.
"
29119,"Yeah, I really do.
"
29120,"You know, I had nothing growing up.
"
29121,"Just like the kids
"
29122,"I took the money from.
"
29123,"No. No, no. I see where this is going.
"
29124,"Don't make me go back there.
"
29125,"Look, I can't have a wedding
"
29126,"with this money now. It's tainted.
"
29127,"Fine, we'll give the money back.
"
29128,"If that guy at the charity
"
29129,"gives us a hard time...
"
29130,"...my friend hasn't shot anyone
"
29131,"in a really long time.
"
29132,"I must say this seems like a lovely
"
29133,"environment to raise a child in.
"
29134,"You are welcome to look
"
29135,"under any of the furniture...
"
29136,"...because, believe me, you won't find
"
29137,"any porn or cigarettes under there.
"
29138,"Before we look around, let me make sure
"
29139,"I have everything I need up to here.
"
29140,"Why don't I show you the baby's room.
"
29141,"- What are you doing?
"
29142,"- You wouldn't let me in.
"
29143,"- I thought you were in trouble.
"
29144,"- Well, we're not.
"
29145,"But you called me ""Bert.""
"
29146,"That's our code word for danger.
"
29147,"- We don't have a code word.
"
29148,"- We don't?
"
29149,"We really should.
"
29150,"From now on, ""Bert""
"
29151,"will be our code word for danger.
"
29152,"So that was the baby's room.
"
29153,"- What room should we see next?
"
29154,"- Any room that isn't behind this couch.
"
29155,"Some people don't get him,
"
29156,"but I think he's really funny.
"
29157,"I did not care for that.
"
29158,"You have to leave.
"
29159,"You slept with our social worker
"
29160,"and never called her back.
"
29161,"She is still pissed,
"
29162,"so she can't see you.
"
29163,"Okay, okay.
"
29164,"- What?
"
29165,"- I forgot my bat.
"
29166,"Oh, my God.
"
29167,"And for the last time,
"
29168,"we do not want to be friends with you!
"
29169,"And we don't wanna buy your bat!
"
29170,"What are you doing here?
"
29171,"Bert. Bert. Bert. Bert.
"
29172,"- Are you friends with him?
"
29173,"- I can explain.
"
29174,"Joey?
"
29175,"All right. Okay.
"
29176,"You have got some nerve
"
29177,"coming back here.
"
29178,"- I can't believe you never called me.
"
29179,"- Excuse me?
"
29180,"You probably don't even remember
"
29181,"my name. It's Joey, by the way.
"
29182,"And don't bother telling me yours,
"
29183,"because I totally remember it, lady.
"
29184,"I waited weeks for you to call me.
"
29185,"I gave you my number.
"
29186,"You never called me.
"
29187,"Don't try to turn this around on me.
"
29188,"I am not some kind of social work...
"
29189,"...that you can just...
"
29190,"...do.
"
29191,"- I'm pretty sure I gave you my number.
"
29192,"- Really? Think about it. Come on.
"
29193,"You're a beautiful woman.
"
29194,"Smart, funny.
"
29195,"We had a really good time.
"
29196,"If I had your number,
"
29197,"why wouldn't I call you?
"
29198,"I don't know.
"
29199,"Well, maybe I'm wrong. I'm sorry.
"
29200,"Hey, too late for apologies. Okay?
"
29201,"You broke my heart.
"
29202,"You know how many women
"
29203,"I had to sleep with to get over you?
"
29204,"- Joey, wait...
"
29205,"- No!
"
29206,"I waited a long time!
"
29207,"I can't wait anymore.
"
29208,"I'm sorry that you had to see that.
"
29209,"I'm so embarrassed.
"
29210,"- Oh, that's really okay.
"
29211,"- Yeah. We totally understand.
"
29212,"- Dating is hard.
"
29213,"- Boy, you people are nice.
"
29214,"And I've got to say...
"
29215,"...I think you're going to make
"
29216,"excellent parents.
"
29217,"Laura!
"
29218,"We're back.
"
29219,"Are you here to take more money?
"
29220,"Because I think what you're
"
29221,"looking for is an ATM.
"
29222,"No, no, we're here
"
29223,"to give the money back.
"
29224,"Yeah. Because you know what?
"
29225,"It's all about the children.
"
29226,"Although it's also about the wedding.
"
29227,"All right, here. No. Oh, God.
"
29228,"If I haven't said so already,
"
29229,"sir, congratulations.
"
29230,"Okay, look, enough, all right?
"
29231,"I'm stepping in
"
29232,"and putting my foot down.
"
29233,"As your future husband,
"
29234,"I'm gonna make this decision for us.
"
29235,"What do you think we should do?
"
29236,"- It's not your decision anymore.
"
29237,"- What?
"
29238,"On behalf of the children of New York,
"
29239,"I reject your money.
"
29240,"- But we're giving you this.
"
29241,"- And I'm giving it back to you.
"
29242,"Come on. Consider it a contribution.
"
29243,"Well, this is very generous.
"
29244,"Take the check. Have a great wedding
"
29245,"and a wonderful life together.
"
29246,"Sounds good to me. We can save up,
"
29247,"come back in a few years...
"
29248,"...and make an even bigger donation.
"
29249,"And when you do, ask for Brian.
"
29250,"- Oh, is that you?
"
29251,"- No.
"
29252,"Hello?
"
29253,"Oh, hi.
"
29254,"Oh, my God, really?
"
29255,"I can't wait to tell Chandler.
"
29256,"Okay. Goodbye.
"
29257,"- Wrong number?
"
29258,"- That was Laura.
"
29259,"She gave us a great report and
"
29260,"we're officially on the waiting list.
"
29261,"- That's great.
"
29262,"- Now we just wait for a call...
"
29263,"...and someone tells us
"
29264,"there's a baby waiting for us.
"
29265,"Hello?
"
29266,"Have you seen Joey's bat?
"
29267,"Okay. I got a spider.
"
29268,"There were two,
"
29269,"I picked the bigger one.
"
29270,"- Okay.
"
29271,"- Okay.
"
29272,"This feels perfectly normal.
"
29273,"Okay, get on the swing.
"
29274,"Okay.
"
29275,"Okay.
"
29276,"Okay.
"
29277,"- See?
"
29278,"- All right. I can do this.
"
29279,"There you go. Good for you.
"
29280,"You know what?
"
29281,"I'm getting used to this little guy.
"
29282,"- I don't even feel him in here anymore.
"
29283,"- That's because he's on your neck.

"
29288,"- Hey, guys.
"
29289,"- Hey.
"
29290,"- Hi.
"
29291,"- Hey.
"
29292,"We need to talk about something.
"
29293,"Yeah. We don't feel like we can
"
29294,"host Thanksgiving this year.
"
29295,"- What?
"
29296,"- Are you kidding?
"
29297,"Well, it's just with work
"
29298,"and the stress of adoption...
"
29299,"...we don't feel like
"
29300,"we have the energy.
"
29301,"Plus, we don't think it's fair
"
29302,"that every year the burden falls on us.
"
29303,"That doesn't sound like you.
"
29304,"That's Monica talking.
"
29305,"- No, we made this decision together.
"
29306,"- She's putting words in your mouth.
"
29307,"Don't you put words in people's mouths.
"
29308,"You put turkey in people's mouths.
"
29309,"I can't believe this.
"
29310,"This is Emma's first Thanksgiving.
"
29311,"- No, it's not.
"
29312,"- It's not? When was she born?
"
29313,"Well, personally, I think it's great
"
29314,"you're giving yourself a break.
"
29315,"- Thank you, Pheebs.
"
29316,"- Sure. It's just as well.
"
29317,"I mean, last year wasn't very good.
"
29318,"I think she's losing her touch.
"
29319,"- What? You are way off, lady.
"
29320,"- Am I? Really? Am I?
"
29321,"Well, why don't you cook
"
29322,"Thanksgiving dinner and prove me wrong.
"
29323,"Well, think about it. You'd be trying
"
29324,"to top what you did last year.
"
29325,"You'd be in competition with yourself.
"
29326,"That's my favorite kind.
"
29327,"Okay, we are doing this.
"
29328,"Don't let yourself
"
29329,"get manipulated this way.
"
29330,"Stay out of this, Chandler.
"
29331,"This is between me and me.
"
29332,"We are supposed to make
"
29333,"these decisions together.
"
29334,"Did you not watch
"
29335,"the Dr. Phil I taped for you?
"
29336,"The One With The Late Thanksgiving
"
29337,"- Hey.
"
29338,"- Hi. Happy Thanksgiving.
"
29339,"Happy Meatless Turkey-Murder Day.
"
29340,"You guys, I ordered some chocolate pies
"
29341,"from that bakery on Bleeker.
"
29342,"- Could you pick them up for me?
"
29343,"- You're not making the pies?
"
29344,"I don't make chocolate pies.
"
29345,"When I was younger,
"
29346,"I entered this pie-eating contest.
"
29347,"I ate so many that the
"
29348,"thought of them makes me sick.
"
29349,"Did you at least win the contest?
"
29350,"Two minutes, twelve pies
"
29351,"and a part of one tin.
"
29352,"- Okay, I'll see you guys at 4.
"
29353,"- Can't wait.
"
29354,"This dinner is gonna be so great.
"
29355,"In your face, last-year me.
"
29356,"- Hey, Rach?
"
29357,"- Yeah.
"
29358,"What's Emma doing today?
"
29359,"Well, let's see, I know that she has
"
29360,"a meeting with her lawyer...
"
29361,"...and then she has to make
"
29362,"a very big poop.
"
29363,"- Why?
"
29364,"- I want to enter her in a baby pageant.
"
29365,"Oh, my God. That's the creepiest thing
"
29366,"I've ever heard.
"
29367,"Okay, but before you say no,
"
29368,"my friend Suzanne is entering her kid.
"
29369,"And compared to Emma,
"
29370,"she's a real dog.
"
29371,"- Phoebe, all babies are beautiful.
"
29372,"- Oh, okay.
"
29373,"No. Phoebe, just the idea
"
29374,"of pitting one baby against another...
"
29375,"...I mean, you know, and judging
"
29376,"who's cuter just for a trophy...
"
29377,"- And a thousand dollars.
"
29378,"...is something I'm very interested in.
"
29379,"Oh, please, do not tell Ross.
"
29380,"He still believes that what's
"
29381,"on the inside is important.
"
29382,"Okay. And Emma needs
"
29383,"a cowgirl outfit for the competition.
"
29384,"Where am I gonna get
"
29385,"a cowgirl outfit on Thanksgiving?
"
29386,"Well, I was thinking...
"
29387,"Take the clothes
"
29388,"off Joey's Cabbage Patch Kid!
"
29389,"Did someone drop the baton again?
"
29390,"Why come all the way
"
29391,"from Kansas to do that?
"
29392,"I don't get older, I just get better.
"
29393,"You know what just occurred to me?
"
29394,"This could be our last Thanksgiving
"
29395,"just the two of us.
"
29396,"I mean, we could be getting a baby soon.
"
29397,"- You don't know that.
"
29398,"- Somebody's gonna pick us.
"
29399,"But we haven't heard a thing
"
29400,"from the adoption agency.
"
29401,"I'm telling you, it's gonna happen.
"
29402,"Next year, it's gonna be
"
29403,"you, me and little Hemingway Bing.
"
29404,"- What? He's my favorite author.
"
29405,"- Name one of his books.
"
29406,"The Firm?
"
29407,"Okay, let's see. Okay, the turkey's
"
29408,"in the oven. The stuffing is ready.
"
29409,"You know, you always cook this meal
"
29410,"all by yourself. Let me help this year.
"
29411,"Oh, Chandler, that's sweet.
"
29412,"But you don't have to do everything
"
29413,"Dr. Phil tells you to do.
"
29414,"I'm serious, let me do something.
"
29415,"Just not the turkey. Nothing high-profile.
"
29416,"Okay, let's see. Oh, the cranberry sauce.
"
29417,"It's easy to make,
"
29418,"and no one really cares about it.
"
29419,"Tell me more.
"
29420,"I'm gonna go check on something across
"
29421,"the hall. You start by washing these.
"
29422,"Not with soap!
"
29423,"You obviously haven't tasted
"
29424,"my Palmolive potatoes.
"
29425,"- Hi. Hey, guess what Joey has.
"
29426,"- Three tickets to today's Rangers game!
"
29427,"Dude, I wanted him to guess.
"
29428,"- Oh, my God.
"
29429,"- Yeah, they're great seats too.
"
29430,"- Guess where they are.
"
29431,"- Center ice.
"
29432,"Did I do something to you?
"
29433,"- The game's at 1.
"
29434,"- So?
"
29435,"- Dinner's at 4. We'll never make it back.
"
29436,"- So we'll leave before it's over.
"
29437,"But it could take us
"
29438,"a long time to get back home.
"
29439,"Plus, Joey could get lost and they could
"
29440,"have to page us to go pick him up.
"
29441,"Dude, two times that happened!
"
29442,"Look, Monica's
"
29443,"been working hard all day.
"
29444,"She didn't want to host
"
29445,"in the first place. We shouldn't go.
"
29446,"He's right, man.
"
29447,"- Yeah, I guess. So we'll see you at 4.
"
29448,"- Okay.
"
29449,"And get ready to taste
"
29450,"my very special cranberries.
"
29451,"Or should I say ""Chan-berries""?
"
29452,"That's some gentle comedy, dude.
"
29453,"- We're still going to the game, right?
"
29454,"- Yeah.
"
29455,"This is contestant number 16,
"
29456,"Rebecca Hope from Yonkers.
"
29457,"- Hey.
"
29458,"- Phoebe, listen, I think we gotta go.
"
29459,"This place is freaking me out.
"
29460,"I've been watching this guy over there.
"
29461,"I don't think he came with a kid.
"
29462,"But we can't leave now.
"
29463,"There was this one baby, Haley,
"
29464,"who was favored to win...
"
29465,"...she got croup,
"
29466,"so she had to stay home.
"
29467,"This competition
"
29468,"just blew wide-open, folks.
"
29469,"Phoebe, it's just too weird.
"
29470,"I just saw a 1 -year-old
"
29471,"with pantyhose on.
"
29472,"Oh, I know. We should've
"
29473,"been more prepared.
"
29474,"It's okay. Now, the way I see it,
"
29475,"our real competition now is Cameron.
"
29476,"My God, they just took her sweater off.
"
29477,"Look at those arms.
"
29478,"Hello, Michelin Man.
"
29479,"Phoebe, come on.
"
29480,"You know what, it's already 3:00.
"
29481,"They haven't even gotten
"
29482,"to Emma's group yet. We got dinner.
"
29483,"But Emma's got what it takes.
"
29484,"She could go all the way!
"
29485,"- Phoebe, you have to calm down.
"
29486,"- Okay.
"
29487,"Rachel, the hottest babies in the tri-state
"
29488,"area are in this room right now.
"
29489,"I overheard a judge say that
"
29490,"not one of them holds a candle to Emma.
"
29491,"- Really?
"
29492,"- Yeah.
"
29493,"- You heard him say that?
"
29494,"- Yeah.
"
29495,"All right. Okay. All right, let's give
"
29496,"these babies something to cry about.
"
29497,"Good. Let's get down to business.
"
29498,"Emma needs some makeup.
"
29499,"What?
"
29500,"She's gonna look washed-out
"
29501,"next to the others.
"
29502,"No, I'm not letting you
"
29503,"put makeup on my baby.
"
29504,"- Why not?
"
29505,"- Because I already did.
"
29506,"You suck!
"
29507,"Get off the ice, you idiot!
"
29508,"- What a game.
"
29509,"- I know. Yeah.
"
29510,"- I can't believe Chandler's missing this.
"
29511,"- I'm sorry he's not here.
"
29512,"But I gotta say,
"
29513,"I am really enjoying nacho chair.
"
29514,"Yeah, I'd probably enjoy it more
"
29515,"if you didn't keep batting my hand away.
"
29516,"- Yeah!
"
29517,"- These seats are great.
"
29518,"I know, I know.
"
29519,"When I was here for ""Holidays on Ice""...
"
29520,"...I was sitting so far away,
"
29521,"Michelle Kwan couldn't read my banner.
"
29522,"We'd better get going. If we don't
"
29523,"leave now, we're gonna be late.
"
29524,"But it's a tie game. So we're a little late.
"
29525,"The girls will be there.
"
29526,"Let's just stay for one more goal.
"
29527,"- I don't know.
"
29528,"- One more fight.
"
29529,"- Okay.
"
29530,"- Okay.
"
29531,"Where is everybody?
"
29532,"They're 45 minutes late.
"
29533,"I can't believe they're not here.
"
29534,"I slave and I slave for what?
"
29535,"They've ruined Cranberry Day.
"
29536,"- How late are we?
"
29537,"- Forty-five minutes.
"
29538,"- Here.
"
29539,"- Okay.
"
29540,"Rachel and Phoebe are already there,
"
29541,"so they probably started without us.
"
29542,"We could just slip in, and
"
29543,"no one needs to know where we were.
"
29544,"- You may want to lose the foam finger.
"
29545,"- Oh, no, no, no.
"
29546,"You just want to put it on your hand.
"
29547,"- You're not at Thanksgiving?
"
29548,"- No, we're late.
"
29549,"- What are you doing here?
"
29550,"- We're late too.
"
29551,"We figured we could be late
"
29552,"because you'd be on time.
"
29553,"Don't point that thing at me, Tribbiani.
"
29554,"- Nobody's here? Monica's gonna kill us.
"
29555,"- Yeah, where were you?
"
29556,"- Well...
"
29557,"- Yeah, what's with the trophy?
"
29558,"Well, we were at a spelling bee.
"
29559,"And I won.
"
29560,"You won an adult
"
29561,"Thanksgiving Day spelling bee?
"
29562,"Yes. Y-E-S. Yes.
"
29563,"Let me see this. ""Grand Supreme
"
29564,"Little Darling, New York Division""?
"
29565,"That's me.
"
29566,"You entered Emma in a beauty pageant?
"
29567,"And it looks like she put makeup on her.
"
29568,"Wait a second. Where have I seen
"
29569,"that cowgirl outfit before?
"
29570,"I can't believe this. She's our daughter.
"
29571,"That you would treat her like
"
29572,"some kind of show dog is inexcusable.
"
29573,"- She won a thousand dollars.
"
29574,"- So this is an annual thing?
"
29575,"That's Alicia May Emory's outfit!
"
29576,"Guys, there are people in there
"
29577,"who are not getting any happier.
"
29578,"- What are we gonna do?
"
29579,"- I gotta put Emma down for a nap.
"
29580,"And, Rach, while you're in there,
"
29581,"throw something on Alicia May.
"
29582,"- All right, what are we gonna say?
"
29583,"- We'll say that we were mugged.
"
29584,"You can't get mad at someone
"
29585,"who's been mugged.
"
29586,"Good. But you don't look
"
29587,"like you were mugged.
"
29588,"No. Here.
"
29589,"Hey!
"
29590,"Do you hear something?
"
29591,"- They're out there.
"
29592,"- Let me see.
"
29593,"I can't believe this. They're an hour late,
"
29594,"and they're just standing there talking.
"
29595,"Everything's so distorted.
"
29596,"It looks like Joey has a giant hand.
"
29597,"That says ""Rangers"" on it.
"
29598,"They went to the game.
"
29599,"Oh, they are in for a world of pain.
"
29600,"- Ross' shirt is torn.
"
29601,"- They're late and they're sloppy.
"
29602,"All right, Emma's napping.
"
29603,"What happened to your shirt?
"
29604,"I got mugged, and they stole my pocket.
"
29605,"We're just trying
"
29606,"to figure out an excuse.
"
29607,"How about this?
"
29608,"We could say that Monica told us 5:00,
"
29609,"not 4:00. That way we're right on time.
"
29610,"Or we could plant PCP in the
"
29611,"apartment and call the cops on her.
"
29612,"That would be a good way to get rid
"
29613,"of all the PCP we have lying around.
"
29614,"We'll just say that she said it was 5:00.
"
29615,"We'll just act casual.
"
29616,"We're not late, we're right on time.
"
29617,"""We know you're out there.""
"
29618,"Who do you think it's from?
"
29619,"Oh, God, this is bad. This is so bad.
"
29620,"Well, let's just go in there
"
29621,"and face them.
"
29622,"I'm not going in first. I bet that vein on
"
29623,"Monica's forehead is popping like crazy.
"
29624,"I hate that thing.
"
29625,"It's like a bolt of lightning.
"
29626,"Why don't we play rock, paper, scissors,
"
29627,"and whoever loses, goes in first.
"
29628,"- All right, I'm in.
"
29629,"- Ready.
"
29630,"I win.
"
29631,"- What is that?
"
29632,"- That's fire. It beats everything.
"
29633,"Oh, really? Does it beat water balloon?
"
29634,"Well-played, Phoebe Buffay.
"
29635,"Well-played.
"
29636,"All right,
"
29637,"let's all go in at the same time.
"
29638,"- Okay.
"
29639,"- Okay.
"
29640,"- It's locked.
"
29641,"- What? Oh, sure, now they lock it.
"
29642,"When they're having sex on the couch,
"
29643,"it's like:
"
29644,"""Come on in,
"
29645,"my butt is surprisingly hairy!""
"
29646,"All right, come on. All right, you guys,
"
29647,"we're so sorry we're late.
"
29648,"Please let us in so we can have
"
29649,"dinner together.
"
29650,"No, everything's cold. The turkey's
"
29651,"dried out and the stuffing's all soggy.
"
29652,"Yeah, and there's a bowl
"
29653,"of cranberry sauce that's...
"
29654,"What happens to cranberry sauce?
"
29655,"- Nothing, it's fine.
"
29656,"- Oh, thank God.
"
29657,"Come on, you guys, we're sorry.
"
29658,"Our subway broke down.
"
29659,"That's a lie! You went to the game.
"
29660,"I can see Joey's hand.
"
29661,"For the love of God, take it off!
"
29662,"Guys, it doesn't matter
"
29663,"why we're late. We're all here now.
"
29664,"Please let us in so we can have
"
29665,"some of your delicious turkey.
"
29666,"I had a dream once
"
29667,"about a fax machine that did that.
"
29668,"That's all the turkey you're gonna get.
"
29669,"- How are we gonna decide who gets this?
"
29670,"- Water balloon!
"
29671,"What are we gonna do? I'm starving.
"
29672,"I just remembered,
"
29673,"we do have something to eat.
"
29674,"Monica put something
"
29675,"in our oven this morning.
"
29676,"You touch that,
"
29677,"and you will be sorry!
"
29678,"Guys, I'd listen to her.
"
29679,"The vein is bigger than I've ever seen it!
"
29680,"Oh, my God, it's Brussels sprouts!
"
29681,"That's worse than no food.
"
29682,"All you got was
"
29683,"Monica's stinky Brussels sprouts.
"
29684,"Stinky?
"
29685,"Please let me stay on this side
"
29686,"of the door.
"
29687,"Oh, I know!
"
29688,"I still have my old key.
"
29689,"We can just unlock the door.
"
29690,"I don't know if that's a good idea.
"
29691,"They don't wanna be with us.
"
29692,"I don't wanna be with them either...
"
29693,"...but it's Thanksgiving, and we should
"
29694,"not want to be together together.
"
29695,"If I could just get in there,
"
29696,"make a face-to-face apology...
"
29697,"...Iook them in the eye,
"
29698,"I could get them to forgive us.
"
29699,"- I don't know.
"
29700,"- I'm telling you...
"
29701,"...I can do it.
"
29702,"Yeah, he can do it.
"
29703,"It all looks so beautiful.
"
29704,"- The turkey, the stuffing.
"
29705,"- The cranberries.
"
29706,"Enough! A monkey could've made them.
"
29707,"Hey, listen, guys,
"
29708,"we feel really terrible.
"
29709,"He's doing that weird eye-contact thing.
"
29710,"Don't look at him. Don't look at him.
"
29711,"Come on, you guys. We want
"
29712,"you to know we're very, very sorry.
"
29713,"Right, guys?
"
29714,"- I feel terrible.
"
29715,"- Oh, so sorry.
"
29716,"But let's not ruin this day.
"
29717,"You've worked so hard.
"
29718,"Let's move past this and try to have
"
29719,"a nice meal all together, huh?
"
29720,"The floating heads
"
29721,"do make a good point.
"
29722,"Yeah, they do seem to feel pretty bad.
"
29723,"- So bad.
"
29724,"- So bad.
"
29725,"Okay.
"
29726,"Okay, you two go get the dessert,
"
29727,"and I'll let you in.
"
29728,"Dessert?
"
29729,"Yeah, I asked you and Phoebe to pick up
"
29730,"the pies. You did remember, right?
"
29731,"Pies. Oh, we thought you said ""prize.""
"
29732,"Here.
"
29733,"- ""Grand Supreme Little Darling""?
"
29734,"- Congratulations!
"
29735,"Oh, my God, you forgot the pies?
"
29736,"Well, I cannot believe this.
"
29737,"You forced me to make dinner,
"
29738,"you're an hour late...
"
29739,"...and you forget the one little thing
"
29740,"that I asked you to do.
"
29741,"Really, girls, not cool.
"
29742,"Well, you man-heads aren't any better.
"
29743,"You lied about going to the game.
"
29744,"You knew it'd make you late,
"
29745,"and you went anyway.
"
29746,"Hey, I'm getting a little tired of this.
"
29747,"We said we're sorry.
"
29748,"It's Thanksgiving, for Pete's sakes!
"
29749,"A day of forgiveness.
"
29750,"- It's a day to be thankful.
"
29751,"- Don't make me come up there!
"
29752,"It's too late for apologies.
"
29753,"Fine, let's just go.
"
29754,"I don't need your stupid dinner.
"
29755,"That would be a lot more convincing
"
29756,"if you weren't drooling.
"
29757,"- Oh, is that what that is?
"
29758,"- Sorry.
"
29759,"Come on, you guys,
"
29760,"let's just do our own Thanksgiving.
"
29761,"- Yeah, I'll cook.
"
29762,"- Yeah, let's go out.
"
29763,"Yeah, you three
"
29764,"have a nice Thanksgiving.
"
29765,"- The three of us?
"
29766,"- Yeah. You, Chan and the vein.
"
29767,"- I'm stuck.
"
29768,"- Joey, that is not gonna work.
"
29769,"No, seriously.
"
29770,"- I'm really wedged in here.
"
29771,"- I'll pull you through.
"
29772,"Okay.
"
29773,"Stop, stop, I'm worried
"
29774,"about damaging my head.
"
29775,"It's a little late for that.
"
29776,"Hurry up, you gotta do something.
"
29777,"All right, well,
"
29778,"this does not change anything.
"
29779,"We need to get something
"
29780,"to grease his face.
"
29781,"- We got turkey grease.
"
29782,"- Bring it.
"
29783,"I just want to say that I'm sorry I referred
"
29784,"to the vein as a separate person.
"
29785,"Here you go.
"
29786,"Oh, that smells good.
"
29787,"- Okay?
"
29788,"- Okay, try it.
"
29789,"It isn't working.
"
29790,"- We're gonna have to unscrew the chain.
"
29791,"- Hurry, I can't feel my ears.
"
29792,"Can you ever feel your ears?
"
29793,"Interesting.
"
29794,"- Chandler, where are your tools?
"
29795,"- Oh, I left them on my bulldozer.
"
29796,"I don't have tools.
"
29797,"- Well, I do, but Rachel borrowed them.
"
29798,"- I lent them to Ross.
"
29799,"- I gave them to Joey.
"
29800,"- I left them at the park.
"
29801,"I'm finding it really hard
"
29802,"not to mess with him.
"
29803,"I stuffed Brussels sprouts
"
29804,"down his pants.
"
29805,"Nice.
"
29806,"Okay, I have to get that.
"
29807,"Now, when I get back,
"
29808,"I want you and your friends to be gone.
"
29809,"Thanksgiving is over.
"
29810,"The vein has spoken.
"
29811,"- It's really starting to hurt.
"
29812,"- Look, I'm gonna pull on the door...
"
29813,"...and you guys push. Maybe we can get
"
29814,"enough room to wiggle him out, okay?
"
29815,"Okay, so push.
"
29816,"Just a sec. We're kind of
"
29817,"in the middle of something here.
"
29818,"Hey, stop putting things
"
29819,"down my pants.
"
29820,"- Come on, guys, push!
"
29821,"- Yeah, come on, push!
"
29822,"Push! Push!
"
29823,"- My cranberries!
"
29824,"- Man, I got food all over me.
"
29825,"I can't believe what you did.
"
29826,"Monica's gonna kill you.
"
29827,"Look! Look! Look what the...
"
29828,"Look what the floating heads did!
"
29829,"I don't care.
"
29830,"What's going on?
"
29831,"That was the adoption agency.
"
29832,"And?
"
29833,"- We're getting a baby!
"
29834,"- Are you serious?!
"
29835,"There's a pregnant woman in Ohio,
"
29836,"and she picked us.
"
29837,"- Oh, my God, that's great!
"
29838,"- That's incredible.
"
29839,"I'm so happy for you.
"
29840,"This Thanksgiving
"
29841,"kicks last Thanksgiving's ass!
"
29842,"To Monica and Chandler
"
29843,"and that knocked-up girl in Ohio.
"
29844,"I'm just so happy you guys
"
29845,"are finally getting a kid.
"
29846,"- I know.
"
29847,"- Have you considered pageanting?
"
29848,"I can't believe they called.
"
29849,"I mean, we're actually getting a baby.
"
29850,"I know how you feel.
"
29851,"- Really?
"
29852,"- Sure.
"
29853,"I went through the exact same thing
"
29854,"with Alicia May Emory.
"
29855,"The waiting, the wondering.
"
29856,"Then one day,
"
29857,"I get that call from Toys""R""Us.
"
29858,"She was in stock.
"
29859,"That is the exact same thing.

"
29864,"- Hey.
"
29865,"- Hey.
"
29866,"We're here to say goodbye.
"
29867,"We're off to Ohio.
"
29868,"Oh, right, your adoption interview.
"
29869,"Yep. We'll meet the lady
"
29870,"who could be carrying our baby.
"
29871,"I can't believe it. When you come back,
"
29872,"you'll have a baby. That is so weird.
"
29873,"And so incorrect.
"
29874,"She's only a few months pregnant.
"
29875,"She liked our application
"
29876,"but might not like us.
"
29877,"Come on, she's gonna love you guys.
"
29878,"Thank you. But we're trying
"
29879,"not to get our hopes up.
"
29880,"A lot could still get in our way.
"
29881,"She could decide against adoption,
"
29882,"like another couple better.
"
29883,"What are you gonna name it?
"
29884,"I could develop a condition in which
"
29885,"I talk and talk and no one hears a word.
"
29886,"But just think, okay?
"
29887,"What if everything goes right?
"
29888,"What if this woman does pick you guys?
"
29889,"Oh, my God. She's gonna pick us!
"
29890,"So we're standing firm on
"
29891,"""not getting our hopes up""?
"
29892,"No. I know things could still
"
29893,"go wrong, but if they don't...
"
29894,"...if this works out,
"
29895,"we're gonna have a baby. A baby!
"
29896,"- Yes. But...
"
29897,"- Oh, my God. It's gonna work!
"
29898,"We're gonna make it work!
"
29899,"I'm gonna be a mommy,
"
29900,"and you're gonna be a daddy!
"
29901,"All right, I'll see you suckers.
"
29902,"I'm gonna go get me a baby!
"
29903,"Screw it. I'm gonna be a daddy!
"
29904,"The One With the Birth Mother
"
29905,"Hey, who's Phoebe with?
"
29906,"I wanna say, ""Someone
"
29907,"I'm gonna have sex with.""
"
29908,"- Hey.
"
29909,"- Hey.
"
29910,"- So who's your friend?
"
29911,"- Oh, that's Sarah.
"
29912,"No. Don't you get any ideas.
"
29913,"I'm not setting you up
"
29914,"with any more of my friends.
"
29915,"- Why? Why?
"
29916,"- Because you'll date her once...
"
29917,"...sleep with her, then forget she exists.
"
29918,"Name one friend of yours I did that with.
"
29919,"- Mandy.
"
29920,"- Mandy, huh?
"
29921,"Really hot blond, big boobs?
"
29922,"- No.
"
29923,"- Might be why I don't remember, huh?
"
29924,"Do you think I'm someone else?
"
29925,"Look, I may not have treated
"
29926,"your friends well in the past.
"
29927,"But I have grown up a lot.
"
29928,"Really. Honest. Rach?
"
29929,"Yeah, believe it or not, it's true.
"
29930,"I mean, when Joey
"
29931,"and I were together...
"
29932,"...he was wonderful.
"
29933,"He was thoughtful and mature.
"
29934,"And for the one week
"
29935,"that we went out...
"
29936,"...he didn't sleep with anybody else.
"
29937,"Growth.
"
29938,"- Fine, I'll give you her number.
"
29939,"- Okay. Thank you.
"
29940,"And I promise you
"
29941,"I will not forget this one.
"
29942,"- Mandy.
"
29943,"- Sarah!
"
29944,"Sarah.
"
29945,"- Hey.
"
29946,"- Hi.
"
29947,"- Hey.
"
29948,"- Hey, guys, I need some fashion advice.
"
29949,"How does this look?
"
29950,"Well, it's... It's a little low.
"
29951,"Pick it up a little.
"
29952,"A little bit more.
"
29953,"A little bit more.
"
29954,"There you go.
"
29955,"Now throw it away.
"
29956,"Come on! This looks good.
"
29957,"Ross, please trust me.
"
29958,"I buy 30 fashion magazines a month.
"
29959,"Now I don't know who's running
"
29960,"for president or who that NATO guy is...
"
29961,"...but I do know that you
"
29962,"have to get far away from that hat.
"
29963,"Damn it. God...
"
29964,"I have this date tomorrow night,
"
29965,"and I have to look cool.
"
29966,"If you want fashion help, Rachel and I
"
29967,"are going shopping tomorrow.
"
29968,"- You're welcome to come with us.
"
29969,"- Really? That would be great.
"
29970,"I mean, I have to do something.
"
29971,"She kind of teased me
"
29972,"about how I dress.
"
29973,"I can see why. Nice shirt.
"
29974,"You're wearing the same shirt.
"
29975,"Stupid Gap on every corner!
"
29976,"Make yourselves comfortable,
"
29977,"and I'll be back with Erica.
"
29978,"Okay, thank you.
"
29979,"Well, this is it.
"
29980,"- Are you okay?
"
29981,"- Yeah, it's just weird, you know?
"
29982,"It's like, ""Hi, I'm Chandler. May I have
"
29983,"the human growing inside you?""
"
29984,"You're gonna be great.
"
29985,"You're gonna be great.
"
29986,"Well, obviously.
"
29987,"Monica? Chandler?
"
29988,"I'd like you to meet Erica.
"
29989,"- Hi.
"
29990,"- Hi. It is so, so nice to meet you.
"
29991,"- Hi.
"
29992,"- Thank you for agreeing to see us.
"
29993,"- Hi.
"
29994,"- I'll let you get acquainted.
"
29995,"- Okay.
"
29996,"- So it's Monica and Chandler?
"
29997,"I only know you as
"
29998,"""File CRW33815-D.""
"
29999,"That's what our friends call us.
"
30000,"Gosh, you know, you're just
"
30001,"such an amazing couple. It's...
"
30002,"...kind of intimidating.
"
30003,"I don't know about that.
"
30004,"Are you kidding me?
"
30005,"I mean, it's enough that you're a doctor.
"
30006,"But on top of it,
"
30007,"you're married to a reverend?
"
30008,"- I don't think that's exactly...
"
30009,"- Let her finish, doctor.
"
30010,"- Hey.
"
30011,"- Hey.
"
30012,"My friend Sarah
"
30013,"had a great time last night.
"
30014,"- Yeah.
"
30015,"- Yeah, so you gonna call this one back?
"
30016,"No.
"
30017,"What are you talking about?
"
30018,"Sarah's great.
"
30019,"Oh, really? You want to know
"
30020,"what your ""great"" friend did?
"
30021,"We're out to dinner, okay?
"
30022,"We were getting along,
"
30023,"having a really nice time.
"
30024,"I was thinking she was really cool.
"
30025,"And then, out of nowhere...
"
30026,"That's it?
"
30027,"That's why you won't
"
30028,"go out with her again?
"
30029,"So she took some fries. Big deal.
"
30030,"Hey, look, it's not about a few fries.
"
30031,"It's about what the fries represent.
"
30032,"- What?
"
30033,"- All food!
"
30034,"Well, I'm sorry.
"
30035,"I can't believe I set you up
"
30036,"with such a monster!
"
30037,"Hey, look, I take a girl out...
"
30038,"...she can order whatever she wants.
"
30039,"The more the better, all right?
"
30040,"Just don't order a garden salad
"
30041,"and then eat my food!
"
30042,"That's a good way to lose some fingers.
"
30043,"- Thank God you're here. Listen to this.
"
30044,"- What?
"
30045,"Joey and my friend are out last night,
"
30046,"having dinner, and she reaches over...
"
30047,"...and takes a few of his fries...
"
30048,"- Oh, no!
"
30049,"What?
"
30050,"You know about the plate thing?
"
30051,"Oh, yeah, yeah. No,
"
30052,"Joey doesn't share food.
"
30053,"I mean, just last week
"
30054,"we were having breakfast...
"
30055,"...and he had a couple grapes
"
30056,"on his plate.
"
30057,"- You wouldn't let her have a grape?
"
30058,"- No, not me.
"
30059,"Emma.
"
30060,"Joey doesn't share food!
"
30061,"Well, I still think that is a stupid reason
"
30062,"not to call someone again.
"
30063,"You are calling her, okay?
"
30064,"And if you need to, then just
"
30065,"get an extra plate of fries for the table.
"
30066,"I like that.
"
30067,"A sharing buffer. Yeah.
"
30068,"Yeah, I'll order some extra fries.
"
30069,"Maybe a plate of onion rings.
"
30070,"Yeah. Yeah.
"
30071,"And a shrimp cocktail.
"
30072,"And some Buffalo wings.
"
30073,"Maybe...
"
30074,"Maybe an individual pizza, huh?
"
30075,"And some mozzarella sticks.
"
30076,"What were we talking about?
"
30077,"Wow, this place is awesome.
"
30078,"We should just go.
"
30079,"I'm not gonna find anything here.
"
30080,"This stuff is ridiculous.
"
30081,"Oh, this place is great!
"
30082,"Rach, come on, I'm not gonna wear
"
30083,"any of this. Nothing silver.
"
30084,"- Why?
"
30085,"- Okay, nothing with hair.
"
30086,"And nothing with padlocks on it!
"
30087,"Ross, look. Look, I know that some
"
30088,"of this stuff is out there.
"
30089,"But I mean, come on, look at this.
"
30090,"Look at this sweater.
"
30091,"I mean, this is just beautiful.
"
30092,"Wow, this is really soft.
"
30093,"Three hundred and fifty dollars?
"
30094,"Down from 700.
"
30095,"You're saving, like, 200 bucks.
"
30096,"Both logic and math are taking
"
30097,"a serious hit today.
"
30098,"Hey, check this out. It's totally you.
"
30099,"- Wow.
"
30100,"- Yeah.
"
30101,"Wow. Actually, this looks pretty good.
"
30102,"Yeah.
"
30103,"""Boys will be boys""?
"
30104,"- What? They will be!
"
30105,"- All right.
"
30106,"- That's it, I'm getting out of here.
"
30107,"- No, Ross, wait, come on.
"
30108,"There's other stuff here. There's some
"
30109,"nice shirts, these nice pants.
"
30110,"Actually, these might look
"
30111,"pretty good on me.
"
30112,"Yes, they will. You know what you
"
30113,"should do? Go take a walk.
"
30114,"All right? I know your size, and I'll
"
30115,"pick out some really good stuff for you.
"
30116,"- Really?
"
30117,"- Yes.
"
30118,"I know what looks sexy on guys.
"
30119,"Just wear what I suggest,
"
30120,"and she is gonna go nuts for you.
"
30121,"So you're saying...
"
30122,"...if I wear these pants,
"
30123,"I might be getting into hers?
"
30124,"Why do men keep talking to me like this?
"
30125,"So the fact that I'm a doctor
"
30126,"and my wife's a reverend...
"
30127,"...that's important to you?
"
30128,"Yeah. I read some great applications...
"
30129,"...but I thought, ""Who better
"
30130,"than a minister to raise a child?""
"
30131,"Amen.
"
30132,"Plus, I thought the baby would be
"
30133,"in good hands with a doctor.
"
30134,"Good hands.
"
30135,"Healing hands.
"
30136,"Reverend, can I ask? Does the Bible
"
30137,"say anything about adoption?
"
30138,"It says, ""Do it.""
"
30139,"""And behold, she did adopt
"
30140,"unto them a baby.
"
30141,"And it was good.""
"
30142,"- Wow.
"
30143,"- Yeah, wow.
"
30144,"I was wondering...
"
30145,"You both have such serious jobs.
"
30146,"Would you have time to take care
"
30147,"of a baby and your flock?
"
30148,"Oh, no, my flock? My flock is good.
"
30149,"Yeah. My flock pretty much
"
30150,"takes care of themselves by this point.
"
30151,"Good flock. Flock, flock, flock.
"
30152,"But being a doctor,
"
30153,"that must take up a lot of time.
"
30154,"Not for me it doesn't.
"
30155,"So how's everything going in here?
"
30156,"We're great. I think
"
30157,"I may have asked all my questions.
"
30158,"Good. Do you have questions for Erica?
"
30159,"Yeah, actually.
"
30160,"So you read a file that you liked...
"
30161,"...and then you gave the agency
"
30162,"the serial number and they contacted us?
"
30163,"Yes. Our system ensures
"
30164,"total anonymity.
"
30165,"- We're very proud of it.
"
30166,"- You should be.
"
30167,"You're really on top of stuff.
"
30168,"Well then, if there's nothing else,
"
30169,"then the two of us should talk.
"
30170,"I actually...
"
30171,"- I don't think we have to.
"
30172,"- We don't?
"
30173,"Yeah, when I read about you two,
"
30174,"I was pretty sure I wanted you...
"
30175,"...but I just thought we should meet
"
30176,"face to face.
"
30177,"I've made my decision.
"
30178,"I choose them.
"
30179,"God, this is great.
"
30180,"This is so great. Did you hear that?
"
30181,"Yeah, I did.
"
30182,"Hey.
"
30183,"Thank you. Thank you so much.
"
30184,"You are so going to heaven!
"
30185,"- We got some really great stuff.
"
30186,"- Yeah.
"
30187,"Yeah, but I'm not sure about some
"
30188,"of the bras I got.
"
30189,"Really? Do you want to try
"
30190,"some of them on for me?
"
30191,"Okay.
"
30192,"Wait, are we in Joey's imagination?
"
30193,"Oh, no. I took one of Ross' bags
"
30194,"by mistake.
"
30195,"And one of mine is missing.
"
30196,"Ross probably has it.
"
30197,"You'll get it from him later.
"
30198,"So, what do you think?
"
30199,"I think we're not wearing
"
30200,"the same shirt anymore.
"
30201,"Yeah. Yeah, Rachel picked it out for me.
"
30202,"She told me to trust her,
"
30203,"and you know what? I'm glad I did.
"
30204,"I turned quite a few heads
"
30205,"on my way over here.
"
30206,"Dude, I really don't think
"
30207,"you should be wearing that.
"
30208,"I see.
"
30209,"Somebody's afraid of a little competition
"
30210,"with the ladies?
"
30211,"Looks like someone is the ladies!
"
30212,"You're just jealous
"
30213,"because you couldn't pull this off.
"
30214,"Yeah. Now if you'll excuse me,
"
30215,"I have a date.
"
30216,"See? All eyes on me!
"
30217,"- We are not signing those papers.
"
30218,"- Why not?
"
30219,"It's wrong. They made a mistake.
"
30220,"They think we're somebody else.
"
30221,"God works in mysterious ways.
"
30222,"You have got to stop.
"
30223,"But she liked us.
"
30224,"She likes Doctor Chandler
"
30225,"and Reverend Monica.
"
30226,"If you think about it,
"
30227,"I'm kind of like a reverend.
"
30228,"I mean, as a chef, I serve God
"
30229,"by feeding the hungry and poor.
"
30230,"Your veal chop is 34.95!
"
30231,"Come on, I just...
"
30232,"I think we've been given an opportunity.
"
30233,"The mistake's already made.
"
30234,"They're writing up the papers now.
"
30235,"But we're not the ones she chose.
"
30236,"How can you feel okay about this?
"
30237,"Because.
"
30238,"We may not be who she thinks we are...
"
30239,"...but no one will ever
"
30240,"love that baby more than us.
"
30241,"- I know.
"
30242,"- I mean, who knows...
"
30243,"...how long it's gonna take
"
30244,"for someone else to give us a baby?
"
30245,"What if no one ever picks us?
"
30246,"Oh, honey...
"
30247,"Please?
"
30248,"Please. We are so close.
"
30249,"Monica, I want a baby too.
"
30250,"But this woman is giving away her child.
"
30251,"She deserves to know who it's going to.
"
30252,"Okay. You're right.
"
30253,"So we'll tell the truth.
"
30254,"And who knows, you know?
"
30255,"Maybe she'll like us for us.
"
30256,"Maybe she will.
"
30257,"Why couldn't I have been a reverend?
"
30258,"You're Jewish.
"
30259,"Technicality!
"
30260,"Garden salad for the lady.
"
30261,"Oh, that looks great. Good ordering.
"
30262,"Seafood platter for the gentleman,
"
30263,"and extra fries.
"
30264,"Enjoy.
"
30265,"Those fries look delicious.
"
30266,"I didn't know you liked French fries.
"
30267,"Help yourself. What's mine is yours.
"
30268,"Wow, are those stuffed clams?
"
30269,"Yes, they are my stuffed clams.
"
30270,"How about those fries, though, huh?
"
30271,"- They are delicious.
"
30272,"- Yeah.
"
30273,"You are beautiful, you know that?
"
30274,"That is so sweet.
"
30275,"Okay, then.
"
30276,"Now look what you did!
"
30277,"What? What is the matter with you?
"
30278,"I don't like it when people
"
30279,"take food off of my plate, okay?
"
30280,"But you said, ""What's mine is yours.""
"
30281,"Well, I didn't mean it!
"
30282,"Fine. Sorry, I didn't think
"
30283,"it was that big a deal.
"
30284,"No, I'm sorry. I...
"
30285,"I'm overreacting, okay?
"
30286,"It's just, when it comes to food, I...
"
30287,"...have certain rules...
"
30288,"...okay? I mean...
"
30289,"...there are things you do, and,
"
30290,"you know, things that you don't do.
"
30291,"Wow, this place looks great.
"
30292,"Oh, you are gonna love it.
"
30293,"And I'm so glad we're finally doing this.
"
30294,"- Me too.
"
30295,"- Here.
"
30296,"So this was fun.
"
30297,"I really am sorry about,
"
30298,"you know, before.
"
30299,"And I want to make sure you
"
30300,"know I really do like you.
"
30301,"Sure, just not as much as clams.
"
30302,"Well, stuffed clams...
"
30303,"Chocolate torte for the lady.
"
30304,"Cheesecake for the gentleman.
"
30305,"Excuse me, sir. There seems to be some
"
30306,"sort of red crap on my cheesecake.
"
30307,"Yes, that's a raspberry coulis.
"
30308,"I'm so stupid ordering cheesecake,
"
30309,"trying to be healthy.
"
30310,"Oh, my God.
"
30311,"- I'll just have what she's having.
"
30312,"- I'm sorry, sir.
"
30313,"That was our last piece.
"
30314,"Oh, no.
"
30315,"This is work. I should call in.
"
30316,"Can you excuse me?
"
30317,"Yeah, sure. No problem.
"
30318,"What are you doing?
"
30319,"I thought you don't share food?
"
30320,"Sure I do.
"
30321,"Coulis?
"
30322,"No. If I can't have your clams,
"
30323,"you can't have my dessert.
"
30324,"This is a two-way street.
"
30325,"Really?
"
30326,"Really.
"
30327,"Now this all better be here
"
30328,"when I come back.
"
30329,"Yeah, of course. I can control myself.
"
30330,"Stop staring at me!
"
30331,"Just a tiny little...
"
30332,"I'm not even sorry.
"
30333,"- Hi.
"
30334,"- Hey.
"
30335,"So these are the preliminary forms
"
30336,"for an open adoption.
"
30337,"There's a lot to go over,
"
30338,"but I'll explain as we go through.
"
30339,"- Is that a picture?
"
30340,"- Yeah.
"
30341,"It's a sonogram they took
"
30342,"of the baby last week.
"
30343,"I thought you might want to see it.
"
30344,"Look, doctor.
"
30345,"Look, before we sign anything,
"
30346,"we really have to talk.
"
30347,"We're not who you think we are.
"
30348,"- I don't understand.
"
30349,"- The agency must have made a mistake.
"
30350,"My wife is not a reverend,
"
30351,"and I'm not a doctor.
"
30352,"- What?
"
30353,"- That's impossible.
"
30354,"I could perform an operation on you
"
30355,"and prove it if you'd like.
"
30356,"I have to check your file. Excuse me.
"
30357,"So who are you?
"
30358,"Our names really are Monica and
"
30359,"Chandler. We're from New York.
"
30360,"Yeah, but the important thing
"
30361,"to know about us...
"
30362,"...is how much we would care
"
30363,"for this little baby.
"
30364,"So you lied to me before?
"
30365,"Well, we ""bore false witness.""
"
30366,"See? I could be a reverend.
"
30367,"I can't believe this.
"
30368,"But we were hoping that
"
30369,"since we told you the truth...
"
30370,"...that you still might consider...
"
30371,"- Giving you my baby?
"
30372,"You think I'd give you my child
"
30373,"after this?
"
30374,"You don't have to decide now.
"
30375,"If you look at our file...
"
30376,"I don't want to look at your file.
"
30377,"This is over.
"
30378,"Erica, wait.
"
30379,"I have nothing to say to you.
"
30380,"Look, you have every reason to be upset.
"
30381,"We did lie.
"
30382,"But only because we've been waiting
"
30383,"and trying to have a baby for so long.
"
30384,"And we don't know how long it's gonna
"
30385,"be before we get another chance.
"
30386,"Why don't you ask the reverend
"
30387,"to pray on it?
"
30388,"Erica, please.
"
30389,"Just consider us.
"
30390,"Ask them to see our file.
"
30391,"Our last name's Bing.
"
30392,"My wife's a chef, and I'm in advertising.
"
30393,"Oh, yeah.
"
30394,"I actually liked you guys.
"
30395,"But it doesn't matter.
"
30396,"What you did was wrong.
"
30397,"But you did like us.
"
30398,"And you should.
"
30399,"My wife's an incredible woman.
"
30400,"She is loving, and devoted and caring.
"
30401,"And don't tell her I said this,
"
30402,"but the woman's always right.
"
30403,"I love my wife more than anything
"
30404,"in this world.
"
30405,"And it...
"
30406,"It kills me that I can't give her a baby.
"
30407,"I really want a kid.
"
30408,"And when that day finally comes,
"
30409,"I'll learn how to be a good dad.
"
30410,"But my wife...
"
30411,"...she's already there.
"
30412,"She's a mother...
"
30413,"...without a baby.
"
30414,"Please?
"
30415,"You still want that baby?
"
30416,"God bless you, Chandler Bing!
"
30417,"Turns out this sweater
"
30418,"is made for a woman.
"
30419,"So why are you still wearing it?
"
30420,"Because it's soft.
"
30421,"Hey, so how was your date?
"
30422,"Not so good.
"
30423,"Well, looks like it's just
"
30424,"the two of us tonight, huh, buddy?
"
30425,"Yeah. And you know what?
"
30426,"We could do a lot worse.
"
30427,"- Yeah.
"
30428,"- Yeah.
"
30429,"Joey doesn't share food!

"
30434,"This cake is amazing!
"
30435,"My God, get a room.
"
30436,"I would get a room with this cake.
"
30437,"I think I could show
"
30438,"this cake a good time.
"
30439,"If you had to, what would
"
30440,"you give up, food or sex?
"
30441,"Sex.
"
30442,"Seriously, answer faster.
"
30443,"Oh, I'm sorry, honey.
"
30444,"But when she said ""sex,""
"
30445,"I wasn't thinking about sex with you.
"
30446,"It's like a giant hug.
"
30447,"Ross, how about you?
"
30448,"Which would you give up?
"
30449,"Food.
"
30450,"How about sex or dinosaurs?
"
30451,"Oh, my God, it's like Sophie's Choice.
"
30452,"Oh, God.
"
30453,"What about you, Joe?
"
30454,"What would you give up, sex or food?
"
30455,"I don't know, it's too hard.
"
30456,"No, you gotta pick one.
"
30457,"Food. No, sex.
"
30458,"Food. Sex. Food. Sex...
"
30459,"I don't know! Oh, God, I want both!
"
30460,"I want...
"
30461,"I want girls on bread!
"
30462,"The One Where Chandler Gets Caught
"
30463,"- You gotta see these pictures of Emma.
"
30464,"- Oh, how cute!
"
30465,"- She looks just like a little doll.
"
30466,"- Oh, no, that is a doll.
"
30467,"Oh, thank God,
"
30468,"because that thing's really creepy.
"
30469,"Look, there's Chandler.
"
30470,"Who's the blond? She's pretty.
"
30471,"He's having an affair.
"
30472,"He is not having an affair!
"
30473,"I'm always right about these things.
"
30474,"No, you're not. Last week,
"
30475,"you thought Ross was trying to kill you.
"
30476,"Well, sorry, but it's hard to believe
"
30477,"that anyone would tell a story that dull...
"
30478,"...just to tell it.
"
30479,"There's something going on with them.
"
30480,"Look!
"
30481,"He's getting into the car with her.
"
30482,"That doesn't mean anything.
"
30483,"Oh, yeah? Well, let's see.
"
30484,"Okay, duck down.
"
30485,"- Hello?
"
30486,"- Hi, Chandler. It's Phoebe.
"
30487,"I know that Monica is working today...
"
30488,"...so I was wondering if you wanted to
"
30489,"come to the movies with me and Rachel.
"
30490,"Oh, I have to work too. Yeah,
"
30491,"I'm stuck here at the office all day.
"
30492,"Well, it's a shame
"
30493,"that you'll miss the movie...
"
30494,"...because we were gonna see,
"
30495,"you know, either Liar Liar...
"
30496,"...or Betrayal
"
30497,"or An Affair to Remember.
"
30498,"Those are all really old.
"
30499,"Okay, then maybe it'll be...
"
30500,"Dude, Where's My Car?
"
30501,"- What?
"
30502,"- They're in a car.
"
30503,"Okay. Well, talk to you later, okay? Bye.
"
30504,"Jeez!
"
30505,"Okay, quick. We gotta find a cab
"
30506,"and follow them.
"
30507,"Yeah, okay. Let me just grab my
"
30508,"night-vision goggles and my stun gun.
"
30509,"I got them.
"
30510,"- Hey.
"
30511,"- Hey. Hi, sweetie.
"
30512,"Hey, you smell like
"
30513,"perfume and cigarettes.
"
30514,"- I was in the car with Nancy.
"
30515,"- Nancy doesn't smoke.
"
30516,"Well, at least the perfume's not mine.
"
30517,"Be thankful for that.
"
30518,"So... What did you think of the house?
"
30519,"It's everything we've been looking for.
"
30520,"Isn't it? And what about
"
30521,"the amazing wanes coating...
"
30522,"...the crown molding
"
30523,"and the dormer windows in the attic?
"
30524,"And the wiggle woms and the zip zorps!
"
30525,"What were the things you said?
"
30526,"- Don't you love the huge yard?
"
30527,"- The fireplace in the bedroom.
"
30528,"And Nancy said it's really underpriced...
"
30529,"...because the guy lost his job
"
30530,"and has to move in with his parents!
"
30531,"This is bringing out a lovely color in you.
"
30532,"So do you think we should get it?
"
30533,"I don't know. What do you think?
"
30534,"- I think we should.
"
30535,"- I do too.
"
30536,"This is huge. How bad do you wanna
"
30537,"smoke right now?
"
30538,"I don't know what you mean,
"
30539,"giant, talking cigarette.
"
30540,"Phoebe called as I was getting
"
30541,"into Nancy's car.
"
30542,"If she asks you, I was at work all day.
"
30543,"Got you. When do we tell them?
"
30544,"We don't. Not until it's 100 percent.
"
30545,"Why upset everybody over nothing?
"
30546,"Okay. Right.
"
30547,"- Oh, my God, that is gonna be so hard.
"
30548,"- I know. Good luck with it.
"
30549,"I just can't see Chandler cheating.
"
30550,"I'm telling you guys, we followed
"
30551,"them out to a house in Westchester.
"
30552,"They went in for 45 minutes, and then
"
30553,"they came out looking pretty happy.
"
30554,"Chandler?
"
30555,"Forty-five minutes?
"
30556,"Well, something's not right.
"
30557,"I can't believe he'd do this to Monica.
"
30558,"I know, and with the baby coming?
"
30559,"- So should we tell her?
"
30560,"- I don't know.
"
30561,"If one of us saw Mike with another
"
30562,"woman, would you want us to tell you?
"
30563,"Why? Who'd you see him with?
"
30564,"- No one. I'm just saying if we did...
"
30565,"- Tell me what you know!
"
30566,"No one! Nothing! Mike's a great guy!
"
30567,"It was hypothetical!
"
30568,"All right. He is a good guy.
"
30569,"You're right. He wouldn't cheat.
"
30570,"If I did see him with someone,
"
30571,"there's no way l...
"
30572,"Who did you see him with?
"
30573,"Oh, look at her. So happy.
"
30574,"If only there were a smaller one
"
30575,"to clean this one.
"
30576,"Hey, is Chandler here?
"
30577,"No, he's picking up dinner.
"
30578,"Why? What's up?
"
30579,"Look, whatever happens,
"
30580,"we're here for you, and we love you.
"
30581,"- All right.
"
30582,"- Chandler might be having an affair.
"
30583,"- What?
"
30584,"- Phoebe and I saw Chandler...
"
30585,"...with a blond woman today
"
30586,"outside on the street.
"
30587,"And then we followed them
"
30588,"to a house in Westchester.
"
30589,"They went in together. I'm so sorry.
"
30590,"Oh, my God. Oh, my God, that's awful.
"
30591,"What did you think of the house?
"
30592,"What?
"
30593,"Monica, you understand
"
30594,"what we're saying, right?
"
30595,"Yeah. Sure. I mean,
"
30596,"I'm devastated, obviously.
"
30597,"Did you think the neighborhood
"
30598,"was homey?
"
30599,"- Hey.
"
30600,"- You son of a bitch.
"
30601,"Is it me, or have the greetings
"
30602,"gone downhill around here?
"
30603,"Phoebe and Rachel
"
30604,"saw you with Nancy today.
"
30605,"They think you're having an affair.
"
30606,"- Who's Nancy?
"
30607,"- What's going on?
"
30608,"Okay...
"
30609,"All right, you better sit down.
"
30610,"- This is... This is pretty big.
"
30611,"- Yeah.
"
30612,"I'm not having an affair.
"
30613,"Nancy is our realtor.
"
30614,"I knew he couldn't be
"
30615,"with a woman for 45 minutes!
"
30616,"Why do you have a realtor?
"
30617,"She's been showing
"
30618,"us houses outside of the city.
"
30619,"- What?
"
30620,"- Are you serious?
"
30621,"When we found out
"
30622,"that we were gonna get this baby...
"
30623,"...Chandler and I decided
"
30624,"we didn't want to raise a kid in the city.
"
30625,"So you're... So you're gonna move?
"
30626,"Oh, my God.
"
30627,"Shouldn't we all vote on stuff like this?
"
30628,"What is wrong with raising a kid
"
30629,"in the city?
"
30630,"I'm doing it. Ross is doing it.
"
30631,"Sarah Jessica Parker is doing it!
"
30632,"And that's great for you guys,
"
30633,"but we want a lawn and a swing set.
"
30634,"A street where our kids
"
30635,"can ride their bikes...
"
30636,"...and maybe an ice-cream truck
"
30637,"can go by.
"
30638,"So you want to buy a house in the '50s.
"
30639,"Have you thought about
"
30640,"what you're giving up?
"
30641,"You can't move out of the city.
"
30642,"What if...?
"
30643,"What if you want Chinese food
"
30644,"at 5 a.m.?
"
30645,"Or a fake Rolex that breaks
"
30646,"as soon as it rains?
"
30647,"Or an Asian hooker
"
30648,"sent right to your door?
"
30649,"You know what? If you want to look
"
30650,"for a house, that's okay.
"
30651,"No! No, it's not! Don't listen to him.
"
30652,"I'm gonna thump you.
"
30653,"It's okay, because they have
"
30654,"to get it out of their system.
"
30655,"Okay? But you're gonna realize
"
30656,"this is the only place you want to be.
"
30657,"Actually...
"
30658,"...we already found a house we love.
"
30659,"- What?
"
30660,"- About an hour ago, we made an offer.
"
30661,"Bet you wish I was
"
30662,"having an affair now, huh?
"
30663,"- You put an offer on a house?
"
30664,"- It's so sweet.
"
30665,"It really is. It has this big yard
"
30666,"that leads down to this stream.
"
30667,"And then there's these old maple trees.
"
30668,"Oh, again with the nature.
"
30669,"What are you, beavers?
"
30670,"Look, I know this is really hard,
"
30671,"and we're really sorry.
"
30672,"Is this because I come over here
"
30673,"without knocking and eat your food?
"
30674,"Because I can stop doing that.
"
30675,"I really, really think I can.
"
30676,"You know that's not the reason, Joe.
"
30677,"I think if you saw it, you'd understand.
"
30678,"You guys were there.
"
30679,"It's beautiful, isn't it?
"
30680,"- Yeah, it is.
"
30681,"- What the hell are you doing?
"
30682,"Well, it is, all right? When we were
"
30683,"out there today, all I kept thinking was:
"
30684,"""I can't believe Chandler's
"
30685,"screwing this woman...
"
30686,"...but, man, this would be
"
30687,"a nice place to live!""
"
30688,"Yeah, but so is this.
"
30689,"Yeah. I mean, if you move there,
"
30690,"you have to leave here.
"
30691,"I mean, how can you leave this place?
"
30692,"Come on, Daddy, listen!
"
30693,"All my life, everyone's
"
30694,"always told me, ""You're a shoe!""
"
30695,"""You're a shoe! You're a shoe.
"
30696,"You're a shoe!""
"
30697,"I stopped and said,
"
30698,"""What if I don't want to be a shoe?
"
30699,"What if I want to be a purse?
"
30700,"Or a hat?""
"
30701,"I don't want you to buy me a hat,
"
30702,"l...
"
30703,"It's a metaphor, Daddy!
"
30704,"You can see where he'd have trouble.
"
30705,"Well, maybe I'll just stay
"
30706,"here with Monica.
"
30707,"I guess we've established
"
30708,"she's staying with Monica.
"
30709,"Your money's mine, Greene.
"
30710,"Your fly's open, Geller.
"
30711,"You know what I just realized?
"
30712,"""Joker"" is ""poker"" with a ""J""!
"
30713,"Coincidence?
"
30714,"That's ""joincidence"" with a ""C""!
"
30715,"Look! Ugly Naked Guy
"
30716,"lit a bunch of candles.
"
30717,"That had to hurt!
"
30718,"Hey, it's your Thanksgiving too.
"
30719,"Instead of watching football,
"
30720,"you could help.
"
30721,"We know.
"
30722,"Rachel, you want to put
"
30723,"the marshmallows in concentric circles.
"
30724,"No, Mon. You want to put them
"
30725,"in concentric circles.
"
30726,"I want to do this.
"
30727,"Every year.
"
30728,"It's stuck!
"
30729,"Step.
"
30730,"How did it get on?
"
30731,"I put it on to scare Chandler.
"
30732,"Oh, my God! Monica's going to
"
30733,"totally freak out!
"
30734,"Plus, it smells really bad in here.
"
30735,"Of course it smells bad.
"
30736,"You have your head up a turkey's ass.
"
30737,"Monica.
"
30738,"Did you get the turkey...?
"
30739,"Oh, my God!
"
30740,"Who is that?
"
30741,"It's Joey.
"
30742,"I got it!
"
30743,"If we win, they have to
"
30744,"get rid of the rooster.
"
30745,"That's interesting!
"
30746,"If you win...
"
30747,"...we give up the bird.
"
30748,"But if we win...
"
30749,"...we get your apartment.
"
30750,"- Deal!
"
30751,"- What?
"
30752,"""Monica's nickname
"
30753,"when she was a hockey goalie?""
"
30754,"- Big Fat Goalie.
"
30755,"- Correct!
"
30756,"""Rachel claims
"
30757,"it's her favorite movie.""
"
30758,"Dangerous Liaisons.
"
30759,"- ""Her actual favorite movie is...?""
"
30760,"- Weekend at Bernie's.
"

"
30766,"- Fancy guest.
"
30767,"- Two seconds.
"
30768,"- Eleven?
"
30769,"Unbelievable!
"
30770,"Eleven is correct.

30772,"first touched a girl's breast?""
"

30786,"with transponding.
"
30787,"He's a transponster!
"
30788,"That's not even a word!
"
30789,"You are mean boys
"
30790,"who are just being mean!
"
30791,"Don't get mad! No one
"
30792,"forced you to raise the stakes.
"
30793,"That is not true!
"
30794,"She forced me!
"
30795,"You got the question wrong.
"
30796,"It was a stupid, unfair question!
"
30797,"Don't blame the questions!
"
30798,"Stop yelling in our apartment!
"
30799,"You are ruining moving day for us.
"
30800,"Chandler!
"
30801,"I saw what you were doing
"
30802,"in the window!
"
30803,"I saw what you're doing to my sister!
"
30804,"Get out here!
"
30805,"Listen, we had a good run.
"
30806,"What was it?
"
30807,"Four, five months?
"
30808,"That's more than most people
"
30809,"have in a lifetime. Goodbye.
"
30810,"Hey, Ross.
"
30811,"What's up, bro?
"
30812,"What the hell are you doing?
"
30813,"What's going on?
"
30814,"I think Ross knows
"
30815,"about me and Monica.
"
30816,"Dude, he's right there.
"
30817,"I thought you were my best friend!
"
30818,"This is my sister!
"
30819,"My best friend and my sister!
"
30820,"I cannot believe this!
"
30821,"We're not just messing around.
"
30822,"I love her.
"
30823,"I'm in love with her.
"
30824,"I'm so sorry that you
"
30825,"had to find out this way.
"
30826,"I'm sorry, but it's true.
"
30827,"I love him too.
"
30828,"My best friend and my sister!
"
30829,"I cannot believe this!
"
30830,"This is the last box of your clothes.
"
30831,"I'm just gonna label it
"
30832,"""What were you thinking?""
"
30833,"I was gonna go across
"
30834,"the hall and write that on Chandler.
"
30835,"Guys, I don't wanna make
"
30836,"things worse, but...
"
30837,"...I don't want to live with
"
30838,"Rachel anymore.
"
30839,"You're so mean to each other.
"
30840,"I don't wanna end up like that
"
30841,"with Rachel. I still like you.
"
30842,"That's fine because I'm not moving.
"
30843,"Phoebe, you gotta take her.
"
30844,"I said some bad stuff...
"
30845,"...but Rachel has qualities
"
30846,"that make her a good roommate.
"
30847,"She gets tons of catalogs and folds
"
30848,"down the pages of things I'd like.
"
30849,"What else?
"
30850,"When I take a shower...
"
30851,"...she leaves me notes on the mirror.
"
30852,"I do. I do do that.
"
30853,"That's nice. I like having things
"
30854,"to read in the bathroom.
"
30855,"When I fall asleep on the couch...
"
30856,"...she covers me with a blanket.
"
30857,"Well, you know,
"
30858,"I don't want you to be cold.
"
30859,"And when I told her that I was gonna
"
30860,"move in with Chandler...
"
30861,"...she was really supportive.
"
30862,"You were so great.
"
30863,"You made it so easy.
"
30864,"And now you have to leave.
"
30865,"And I have to live with a boy!
"
30866,"- She really left.
"
30867,"- I know.
"
30868,"- Thank you.
"
30869,"- No problem, roomie.
"
30870,"- Can I ask you a question?
"
30871,"- Sure.
"
30872,"What the hell is that dog doing here?
"
30873,"A little toast here. Ding, ding!
"
30874,"This isn't exactly the kind of
"
30875,"Thanksgiving you planned...
"
30876,"...but for me this has
"
30877,"been really great.
"
30878,"I think because it didn't
"
30879,"involve divorce...
"
30880,"...or projectile vomiting.
"
30881,"If you had gone to Vail...
"
30882,"...or if you had been with your
"
30883,"family, or if you didn't have...
"
30884,"...syphilis and stuff...
"
30885,"...we wouldn't be
"
30886,"all together.
"
30887,"So I guess what I'm trying
"
30888,"to say is...
"
30889,"...that I'm very thankful that all
"
30890,"of your Thanksgivings sucked.
"
30891,"- That's so sweet!
"
30892,"- Thank you.
"
30893,"Here's to a lousy Christmas!
"
30894,"And a crappy New Year!
"
30895,"- Hear, hear!
"
30896,"- Hear, hear!
"
30897,"You can't move. You just...
"
30898,"You just can't.
"
30899,"Rachel's right.
"
30900,"This is where you guys belong.
"
30901,"You don't wanna live in Westchester.
"
30902,"That's the worst of the Chesters.
"
30903,"You know, sometimes when I'm alone
"
30904,"in my apartment, I look over here...
"
30905,"...and you guys are just having dinner...
"
30906,"...or watching TV or something...
"
30907,"...but it makes me feel better.
"
30908,"And now when I look over,
"
30909,"who am I gonna see?
"
30910,"The Gottliebs? The Yangs?
"
30911,"They don't make me feel so good.
"
30912,"Yeah. So don't move, okay?
"
30913,"Just stay here...
"
30914,"...and maybe close your blinds at night.
"
30915,"- Hey.
"
30916,"Hello?
"
30917,"It's Nancy. They responded to our offer.
"
30918,"And?
"
30919,"Okay. Thanks.
"
30920,"They passed.
"
30921,"They said they won't go a penny
"
30922,"under the asking price.
"
30923,"- We can't afford that.
"
30924,"- I know.
"
30925,"Well, there you go.
"
30926,"I'm really sorry, you guys.
"
30927,"Yeah, I'm sorry too. I'm even more sorry
"
30928,"that phone call didn't come...
"
30929,"...before I told you about looking
"
30930,"through the window.
"
30931,"Yeah. Well, we're gonna
"
30932,"let you be alone.
"
30933,"- You gonna be okay?
"
30934,"- Yeah, we'll be okay.
"
30935,"Love you guys.
"
30936,"You know, I'm really sorry
"
30937,"I wasn't more supportive before.
"
30938,"That's okay. We understand.
"
30939,"Yeah, and about this Nancy...
"
30940,"If you're not sleeping with her, should I?
"
30941,"I know there'll be other houses,
"
30942,"but I just...
"
30943,"- I love that one so much.
"
30944,"- Yeah.
"
30945,"Well, it's a good thing we got it then.
"
30946,"- What?
"
30947,"- We got the house.
"
30948,"- Oh, my God.
"
30949,"- I didn't wanna tell you in front of them.
"
30950,"We got it?! We got the house?!
"
30951,"We're getting a house!
"
30952,"- We're getting a house.
"
30953,"- And a baby.
"
30954,"We're growing up.
"
30955,"We sure are.
"
30956,"- Who's gonna tell them?
"
30957,"- Not it!
"
30958,"Not it! Damn it!
"
30959,"Rachel, this is yours.
"
30960,"Why? What are these for?
"
30961,"- You'll see.
"
30962,"- All right, everybody open them.
"
30963,"Wow, this is so beautiful!
"
30964,"These are the ones
"
30965,"I was looking at in the store!
"
30966,"- I know.
"
30967,"- Oh, I love this!
"
30968,"A meatball sub!
"
30969,"Thanks!
"
30970,"Seriously, guys, what's going on?
"
30971,"What are these for?
"
30972,"Well, I didn't know
"
30973,"how to tell you before...
"
30974,"...but we got the house.
"
30975,"- Enjoy!

"
30996,"You guys wanna come

"
31003,"I can't believe you get
"
31004,"to meet Donny Osmond.
"
31005,"Seriously?
"
31006,"Ross and I always wanted to be
"
31007,"Donny and Marie.
"
31008,"You guys just keep getting
"
31009,"cooler and cooler.
"
31010,"Yeah, we used to perform
"
31011,"for our family and friends.
"
31012,"Oh, God, that's right.
"
31013,"I blocked that out.
"
31014,"I'm leaving you.
"
31015,"It's so weird to see
"
31016,"all these people again.
"
31017,"Oh, my God, look. There's Jeffrey Klarik.
"
31018,"- Who?
"
31019,"- He was roommates with John Rosoff.
"
31020,"He went out with Andrea Tamborino.
"
31021,"She dumped him for Michael Skloff.
"
31022,"Did I go to this school?
"
31023,"Hey, there's Missy Goldberg.
"
31024,"You gotta remember her.
"
31025,"Sure. Nice.
"
31026,"Dude, you're married to my sister.
"
31027,"You're right. By saying ""nice,""
"
31028,"I'm virtually licking her.
"
31029,"Hey, I hear she's single again.
"
31030,"You think I should ask her out?
"
31031,"Are you asking permission
"
31032,"to break the pact?
"
31033,"Yes, please.
"
31034,"Hey. Hey, check out
"
31035,"the fliers for the band.
"
31036,"- I made them on a Macintosh.
"
31037,"- Awesome.
"
31038,"The name really stands out.
"
31039,"Thanks to a little something called
"
31040,"Helvetica Bold 24-point.
"
31041,"Man, we're gonna rock
"
31042,"that Asian Student Union.
"
31043,"- Hey, guys.
"
31044,"- Hey, Missy.
"
31045,"- Our band is playing on Friday.
"
31046,"- Yeah, you should come check us out.
"
31047,"We're called Way/No Way.
"
31048,"- No way.
"
31049,"- Way.
"
31050,"- Great. I'll be there.
"
31051,"- Fresh.
"
31052,"- Boss.
"
31053,"- Mint.
"
31054,"- She's gone.
"
31055,"- I know it.
"
31056,"- I am totally gonna ask her out.
"
31057,"- Dude, I was gonna ask her out.
"
31058,"- I said it first, bro.
"
31059,"- Well, I thought it first, Homes.
"
31060,"- Look, if you date...
"
31061,"- Wait! Wait! What are we doing?
"
31062,"What we have is too important
"
31063,"to mess it up over some girl.
"
31064,"I mean, we can get laid
"
31065,"any time we want.
"
31066,"Totally.
"
31067,"- I had sex in high school.
"
31068,"- Me too. I'm good at it.
"
31069,"All right, I say we make a pact.
"
31070,"Neither of us will go out
"
31071,"with Missy Goldberg.
"
31072,"You got it.
"
31073,"That's Missy Goldberg, Phoebe Cates
"
31074,"and Molly Ringwald...
"
31075,"...who we can't go out with.
"
31076,"- Those are the pacts.
"
31077,"And Sheena Easton. But we probably
"
31078,"couldn't get her anyway.
"
31079,"Maybe not you.
"
31080,"Well, I officially give you permission
"
31081,"to break the pact.
"
31082,"Thank you.
"
31083,"Here I go. Hey, remember how scary
"
31084,"it used to be going up to girls in college?
"
31085,"- Your hands are shaking.
"
31086,"- I know. And I can't stop sweating.
"
31087,"Five, four, three. Applause.
"
31088,"Yeah!
"
31089,"Welcome. It is Soap Opera Week
"
31090,"here on Pyramid.
"
31091,"Let's meet our contestants. First,
"
31092,"Gene Lester is a database specialist.
"
31093,"He's gonna be playing with
"
31094,"Days of Our Lives star Joey Tribbiani.
"
31095,"And over here,
"
31096,"we have Henrietta Cherry.
"
31097,"I know it can be intimidating for
"
31098,"regular people to be around celebrities...
"
31099,"...but relax. I'm just like you,
"
31100,"only better-looking and richer.
"
31101,"She'll be playing with star of
"
31102,"General Hospital, Leslie Charleson.
"
31103,"Welcome, everybody. Good luck
"
31104,"to all of you. Let's play Pyramid.
"
31105,"All right? Now, we flipped a coin
"
31106,"before the show.
"
31107,"Gene, you won the toss,
"
31108,"so you'll start. Which category?
"
31109,"- ""You Crossed the Line.""
"
31110,"- ""You Crossed the Line."" Joey...
"
31111,"...describe for Gene these things
"
31112,"that have lines.
"
31113,"Give me 20 seconds on the clock,
"
31114,"please. Ready? Go.
"
31115,"Okay, it's a store like a supermarket.
"
31116,"I see what I did there. Okay, okay.
"
31117,"I'm writing in my...
"
31118,"- Diary.
"
31119,"- No, more like a notebook.
"
31120,"If I'm building a house, the plan...
"
31121,"...isn't called a ""shmooprint""...
"
31122,"I can't do that either?
"
31123,"In high school, I once had sex
"
31124,"with a girl right in the middle of the...?
"
31125,"- Cafeteria?
"
31126,"- Yeah, but they're not looking for that.
"
31127,"- Thank you so much for this.
"
31128,"- You like it?
"
31129,"Oh, my God, it's all so elegant.
"
31130,"When's the dirty stuff starting?
"
31131,"- What?
"
31132,"- The strippers and the guys dancing...
"
31133,"...and, you know, pee-pees flying about.
"
31134,"Pheebs, I... There isn't gonna be
"
31135,"any ""flying about.""
"
31136,"We thought we were
"
31137,"a little too mature for stuff like that.
"
31138,"Oh, okay.
"
31139,"I see what you're doing. That's fine.
"
31140,"This is all there is. Just tea. Okay.
"
31141,"Raunchy.
"
31142,"Seriously, Pheebs, it's not gonna be
"
31143,"that kind of a party.
"
31144,"Really? So this is...?
"
31145,"This is my big sendoff into married life?
"
31146,"Rachel, this is the only
"
31147,"bachelorette party I'm ever gonna have.
"
31148,"I've got a big wad of ones in my purse.
"
31149,"Really? I mean, really? It's just tea?
"
31150,"No.
"
31151,"- Phoebe, of course there's more.
"
31152,"- Okay.
"
31153,"I mean, let me just go talk to Monica...
"
31154,"...and get an ETA on the pee-pees.
"
31155,"Now, Gene, I must remind you, you need
"
31156,"all six of these to stay in the game.
"
31157,"Describe for Joey
"
31158,"""things you find in your refrigerator.""
"
31159,"They might as well
"
31160,"just give us the points.
"
31161,"Give me 20 seconds on the clock.
"
31162,"Ready? Go.
"
31163,"- You put this in your coffee.
"
31164,"- A spoon. Your hands. Your face.
"
31165,"- It's white.
"
31166,"- Paper. Snow. A ghost!
"
31167,"- It's heavier than milk.
"
31168,"- A rock. A dog. The Earth.
"
31169,"Pass.
"
31170,"- You put it on a sandwich.
"
31171,"- Salami. Anchovies. Jam.
"
31172,"- It's white.
"
31173,"- Paper. Snow. A ghost!
"
31174,"- It's made from eggs.
"
31175,"- Chickens?
"
31176,"Pass.
"
31177,"- You put this on a hamburger.
"
31178,"- Ketchup! Relish!
"
31179,"Stop!
"
31180,"Oh, time's up. Well, Joey, you were...
"
31181,"...almost on a roll there. Gene...
"
31182,"...you'll have a chance to go to
"
31183,"the Winner's Circle, but now...
"
31184,"...Henrietta, you're going to the Winner's
"
31185,"Circle to try your luck for $ 10,000...
"
31186,"...right after this. Don't go away.
"
31187,"And we're out.
"
31188,"Oh, so we didn't win.
"
31189,"But it's fun to play the game, right?
"
31190,"I got a kid starting college.
"
31191,"I have to get surgery on my knee.
"
31192,"You just lost me 10 grand.
"
31193,"Oh, wow.
"
31194,"I'm so sorry. Okay, I promise,
"
31195,"we'll do better next time.
"
31196,"Well, I will, because I won't be
"
31197,"playing with you.
"
31198,"Hey, some of those are pretty hard.
"
31199,"Like, why would there be
"
31200,"a ghost in my fridge?
"
31201,"Yeah.
"
31202,"- So Saturday night?
"
31203,"- I'd love to.
"
31204,"Great.
"
31205,"So how come it took you so long
"
31206,"to ask me out?
"
31207,"Oh, well, this is gonna sound
"
31208,"kind of silly...
"
31209,"...but do you remember
"
31210,"my roommate, Chandler Bing?
"
31211,"Sure. He was in your ""band.""
"
31212,"It's been 16 years,
"
31213,"but the air quotes still hurt.
"
31214,"- Sorry.
"
31215,"- That's okay. Anyway...
"
31216,"Well, he and I both
"
31217,"really liked you a lot...
"
31218,"...but we didn't want it to jeopardize
"
31219,"our friendship, so we made a pact...
"
31220,"...that neither of us could ask you out.
"
31221,"- Really?
"
31222,"- Yeah, why?
"
31223,"Well, Chandler and I used to make out.
"
31224,"A lot.
"
31225,"- You did?
"
31226,"- Yeah.
"
31227,"- We'd go to the science lab after-hours.
"
31228,"- And on my turf?!
"
31229,"Hey, where is this guy?
"
31230,"It's been over an hour.
"
31231,"He's coming from Jersey. He said
"
31232,"he'd get here as fast as he could.
"
31233,"- Who is it?
"
31234,"- It's the police.
"
31235,"The police!
"
31236,"That's right. It's Officer Goodbody.
"
31237,"What's the matter, officer?
"
31238,"Has someone been bad?
"
31239,"That's a lot of stairs.
"
31240,"Boy.
"
31241,"You should warn people
"
31242,"there's no elevator.
"
31243,"I should not have had
"
31244,"that Mexican food for lunch.
"
31245,"Are you gonna be okay, Officer...?
"
31246,"- Goodbody.
"
31247,"- lf you say so.
"
31248,"So where's the young lady...
"
31249,"...who I am supposed to take
"
31250,"downtown?
"
31251,"Oh, God.
"
31252,"All right. Somebody show me
"
31253,"where to plug in my box...
"
31254,"...and we'll get this party started.
"
31255,"- Over here?
"
31256,"- Yeah.
"
31257,"- All right.
"
31258,"- Rachel?
"
31259,"- Yeah?
"
31260,"- Are you kidding?
"
31261,"We didn't know you wanted a stripper,
"
31262,"so we got the phone book...
"
31263,"...and got the first name we could find.
"
31264,"- How old's your phone book?
"
31265,"Oh, my God, this man is gonna
"
31266,"get naked in my apartment.
"
31267,"God, no. I don't wanna see him
"
31268,"take his clothes off.
"
31269,"Are you talking about me?
"
31270,"No.
"
31271,"I mean, obviously we wanna see you
"
31272,"take your clothes off.
"
31273,"You big piece of eye candy.
"
31274,"Okay. Okay, ladies,
"
31275,"can I have your attention, please?
"
31276,"Oh, yeah.
"
31277,"Did someone call
"
31278,"for the long arm of the law?
"
31279,"I should warn you,
"
31280,"I have a concealed weapon.
"
31281,"I hope you're familiar
"
31282,"with this state's penal code.
"
31283,"Okay, okay. Enough teasing.
"
31284,"Now for some pleasing.
"
31285,"She cringed.
"
31286,"This is how I look when I'm turned-on.
"
31287,"You were talking about me before.
"
31288,"Look, I don't need this. I'm out of here.
"
31289,"Where's my hat?
"
31290,"Look, I've been in this business
"
31291,"for a long time.
"
31292,"Shocking.
"
31293,"Now, if you'll just pay me my $300,
"
31294,"I'll be on my way.
"
31295,"- $300? Are you kidding?
"
31296,"- That's okay. Let me get my checkbook.
"
31297,"You're not gonna pay him.
"
31298,"He didn't do anything.
"
31299,"Didn't do anything? I took a bus
"
31300,"all the way from Hoboken.
"
31301,"I climbed, I don't know,
"
31302,"like, a billion stairs.
"
31303,"And it's not like I can
"
31304,"take them two at a time.
"
31305,"I don't care.
"
31306,"We're not paying you $300 for this.
"
31307,"It's not my fault if you're
"
31308,"too uptight to appreciate...
"
31309,"...the male form in all its glory.
"
31310,"Okay, I'm uptight. That's why I don't
"
31311,"wanna watch a middle-aged guy...
"
31312,"...dance around in what I can only
"
31313,"assume is a child's Halloween costume.
"
31314,"I may have borrowed this
"
31315,"from my nephew...
"
31316,"...but let me assure you,
"
31317,"what's underneath is all man.
"
31318,"I'm sorry, did you say ""all man""
"
31319,"or ""old man""?
"
31320,"You're mean.
"
31321,"- Look, officer... Sir?
"
31322,"- Damn it.
"
31323,"Big surprise.
"
31324,"The hunk of beef has feelings.
"
31325,"Applause.
"
31326,"Okay, Henrietta, you picked
"
31327,"""Jack and Jill Went Up The Hill.""
"
31328,"My friend Rachel has a kid.
"
31329,"I totally know nursery rhymes.
"
31330,"Joey, describe these things associated
"
31331,"with the United States Congress.
"
31332,"Give me 20 seconds
"
31333,"on the clock, please.
"
31334,"Ready? Go.
"
31335,"Pass.
"
31336,"Pass.
"
31337,"Pass.
"
31338,"- The thing hanging in your throat.
"
31339,"- Uvula.
"
31340,"Then pass.
"
31341,"Okay. Henrietta, you didn't get
"
31342,"all the points you needed...
"
31343,"...so that means, Gene, you are going to
"
31344,"the Winner's Circle to try for $ 10,000.
"
31345,"And you're gonna be going there
"
31346,"with Joey Tribbiani.
"
31347,"You made out with Missy Goldberg?
"
31348,"How could you do that
"
31349,"after you promised me?
"
31350,"Excuse me.
"
31351,"That didn't make us sound gay at all.
"
31352,"- You broke the pact.
"
31353,"- Ross, that was 16 years ago.
"
31354,"That doesn't matter. We're talking
"
31355,"about the foundation of our friendship.
"
31356,"I believe the foundation of our friendship
"
31357,"was unfortunate hair.
"
31358,"If we're really gonna do this, it's not
"
31359,"like you never broke one of the pacts.
"
31360,"- I didn't.
"
31361,"- Oh, really?
"
31362,"- No.
"
31363,"- Oh, really?
"
31364,"- No.
"
31365,"- Adrienne Turner.
"
31366,"Yes?
"
31367,"- Hey, Adrienne.
"
31368,"- Hey, Adrienne. Hey.
"
31369,"I never did anything
"
31370,"with Adrienne Turner.
"
31371,"Oh, please. And you knew
"
31372,"how much I liked her.
"
31373,"I don't know what you're talking about.
"
31374,"Really? Remember
"
31375,"that party freshman year?
"
31376,"A week before Christmas vacation? I do.
"
31377,"You had some visitors.
"
31378,"I can't believe we're
"
31379,"at a real college party.
"
31380,"I have to pee so bad.
"
31381,"This is so awesome.
"
31382,"College guys are so cute.
"
31383,"- Hey, you've got a boyfriend.
"
31384,"- I know.
"
31385,"But if a guy who looks like Corey Haim
"
31386,"wants to kiss me, I am so gonna let him.
"
31387,"Hey, look, there's Chandler.
"
31388,"That stupid friend of Ross'
"
31389,"who said I was fat.
"
31390,"- I've already lost four pounds.
"
31391,"- You can so totally tell.
"
31392,"I know!
"
31393,"Well, let's see,
"
31394,"maybe he knows where Ross is.
"
31395,"Hey, how's it going?
"
31396,"- Aren't you...?
"
31397,"- Yeah, Rachel.
"
31398,"And this is Ross' sister, Monica.
"
31399,"We met at Thanksgiving.
"
31400,"Right. So how you doing?
"
31401,"Bitchen.
"
31402,"- Hi, Monica.
"
31403,"- Hi, Chandler.
"
31404,"It's really nice to see you. Not!
"
31405,"Okay.
"
31406,"I'll see if I can find Ross.
"
31407,"Oh, my God, Rach. Beanbag chairs.
"
31408,"Do not let me sit in one of those.
"
31409,"We'll be here for days.
"
31410,"Listen, Adrienne,
"
31411,"you can't tell Chandler about this.
"
31412,"Oh, believe me, Ross,
"
31413,"I won't be telling anybody about this.
"
31414,"Cool.
"
31415,"I didn't know you knew about that.
"
31416,"Well, I did. And it hurt.
"
31417,"That's when I wrote the song
"
31418,"""Betrayal in the Common Room.""
"
31419,"Man, I'm sorry.
"
31420,"Look, that was a long time ago.
"
31421,"So I made out with Adrienne,
"
31422,"and you made out with Missy.
"
31423,"Well, I guess we're even.
"
31424,"We are even, right?
"
31425,"One more thing. I was so pissed at you
"
31426,"that night, I wanted to get back at you.
"
31427,"So I thought, ""Who does Ross
"
31428,"like more than anybody?""
"
31429,"What did you do to my mom?
"
31430,"Not her.
"
31431,"I am so drunk.
"
31432,"That's weird. I've had the same number
"
31433,"of beers as you and don't feel anything.
"
31434,"So you girls having fun?
"
31435,"For your information, ass-munch...
"
31436,"...I've lost four pounds.
"
31437,"Maybe even five with all the dancing.
"
31438,"- Somebody order a pizza?
"
31439,"- Oh, that's me!
"
31440,"I am so not gonna do good
"
31441,"on my SATs tomorrow.
"
31442,"Well, maybe you could go to school here
"
31443,"next year and we could totally hang out.
"
31444,"Oh, yeah. There's a plan.
"
31445,"Why don't I just start taking
"
31446,"my smart pills now.
"
31447,"Well, maybe you could get in
"
31448,"on a beauty scholarship.
"
31449,"What a line.
"
31450,"- So where are you applying to?
"
31451,"- Well...
"
31452,"...I think it's kind of really important
"
31453,"that I go somewhere where there's sun.
"
31454,"So I'm sort of... Hey!
"
31455,"I'm in college, and I'm in a band.
"
31456,"Yeah, okay.
"
31457,"What's the matter? You never saw
"
31458,"a 50-year-old stripper cry before?
"
31459,"You know, it's fine. We'll pay you.
"
31460,"No, no, you're right. Who am I kidding?
"
31461,"I should have hung up
"
31462,"that breakaway jockstrap years ago.
"
31463,"What am I gonna do? I mean...
"
31464,"...this has been my life for 32 years.
"
31465,"Taking my clothes off
"
31466,"in front of people is all I know.
"
31467,"No, there's got to be something else
"
31468,"that you can do.
"
31469,"I mean, what skills do you have?
"
31470,"I don't know.
"
31471,"I can make my pecs dance.
"
31472,"I can pick up a dollar bill
"
31473,"with my butt cheeks.
"
31474,"I can go to that special place
"
31475,"inside me where I feel no shame.
"
31476,"So maybe something in an office.
"
31477,"Or you could... You could teach stripping.
"
31478,"You know, share your gift.
"
31479,"Pass the torch.
"
31480,"You know, actually,
"
31481,"that's not a bad idea.
"
31482,"I could do it out of my apartment.
"
31483,"I don't think my mom would mind.
"
31484,"There you go. Okay.
"
31485,"You think you're gonna be okay?
"
31486,"- Yeah. Yeah.
"
31487,"- Yeah.
"
31488,"This is so weird.
"
31489,"You never know when it's gonna be
"
31490,"your last dance.
"
31491,"And I didn't even get a chance
"
31492,"to finish it.
"
31493,"Finish it.
"
31494,"- What?
"
31495,"- Your last dance. Do it for us.
"
31496,"- Really?
"
31497,"- Really?
"
31498,"Yeah. Yeah, he deserves to do
"
31499,"the thing he loves one last time.
"
31500,"Okay. All right. Get ready, ladies.
"
31501,"Okay.
"
31502,"Oh, this is so hot!
"
31503,"Oh, no, don't stop.
"
31504,"Have to.
"
31505,"Welcome to the Winner's Circle.
"
31506,"Joey, Gene, you guys ready?
"
31507,"- Yeah.
"
31508,"- Sure.
"
31509,"Okay. Give me 60 seconds
"
31510,"on the clock, please.
"
31511,"Ready? Go.
"
31512,"Oak. Maple. Elm. Birch.
"
31513,"I don't know. Types of trees...?
"
31514,"Buenos dï¿½as. Enchilada. Por favor.
"
31515,"Oh, I'm so sorry,
"
31516,"I don't know any Spanish words.
"
31517,"A match. A candle.
"
31518,"Things that go:
"
31519,"when you put them out.
"
31520,"A torch. A bonfire.
"
31521,"- Your pee.
"
31522,"- Things that burn.
"
31523,"""I'd like to go for a walk.""
"
31524,"""Scratch my belly.""
"
31525,"Dude. Dude, I think you're losing it.
"
31526,"""I have fur."" ""I like to bark.""
"
31527,"What a dog says.
"
31528,"- Pepperoni.
"
31529,"- Pizza toppings!
"
31530,"Cindy Crawford. Christie Brinkley.
"
31531,"Heidi Klum.
"
31532,"Claudia Schiffer. Christy Turlington.
"
31533,"Kate Moss.
"
31534,"Girls Chandler could never get?
"
31535,"- Supermodels.
"
31536,"- Where?
"
31537,"Hey. Where's Rachel?
"
31538,"She and Phoebe took the stripper
"
31539,"to the hospital.
"
31540,"Did you know Chandler kissed Rachel?
"
31541,"- What? When was this?
"
31542,"- 1987.
"
31543,"The weekend you guys
"
31544,"visited me at school.
"
31545,"- Oh, my God. That's wild.
"
31546,"- But it was, like, a million years ago.
"
31547,"- It doesn't matter.
"
31548,"- It matters to me.
"
31549,"- Why?
"
31550,"- Because the night you kissed Rachel...
"
31551,"...was the night I kissed Rachel
"
31552,"for the very first time.
"
31553,"- You kissed her that night too?
"
31554,"- Two guys in one night?
"
31555,"Oh, I thought she became a slut
"
31556,"after she got her nose fixed.
"
31557,"- Seriously, where did this happen?
"
31558,"- Okay...
"
31559,"...after you told me she was
"
31560,"passed out in our room...
"
31561,"...I went in there to make sure
"
31562,"she was all right.
"
31563,"She was lying on my bed,
"
31564,"all buried in people's coats.
"
31565,"I went to kiss her on the forehead...
"
31566,"...but it was so dark,
"
31567,"I accidentally got her lips.
"
31568,"I started to pull away, but then
"
31569,"I felt her start to kiss me back.
"
31570,"It was only for a second,
"
31571,"but it was amazing.
"
31572,"And now I find out
"
31573,"that you kissed her first.
"
31574,"- Wait, what bed did you say she was on?
"
31575,"- Mine.
"
31576,"- I'm sure I put her on my bed.
"
31577,"- No, she was definitely on my bed.
"
31578,"Why would I kiss a girl
"
31579,"and then put her on your bed?
"
31580,"Well, then who was on my bed?
"
31581,"No! No!
"
31582,"Yes!
"
31583,"- You were under the pile of coats?
"
31584,"- I was the pile of coats!
"
31585,"Oh, my God!
"
31586,"You were my midnight mystery kisser?!
"
31587,"You were my first kiss with Rachel?!
"
31588,"You were my first kiss ever?!
"
31589,"What did I marry into?!
"
31590,"Crap!

"
31595,"Oh, hey, Joey.
"
31596,"- Hey.
"
31597,"- Listen, I need to ask you something.
"
31598,"You know how my stepdad's in prison?
"
31599,"- Yeah.
"
31600,"- Yeah.
"
31601,"He was supposed to get a weekend
"
31602,"furlough so he could go to the wedding.
"
31603,"But he just called and...
"
31604,"Well, apparently stabbing Iceman in the
"
31605,"exercise yard couldn't wait till Monday.
"
31606,"- So he can't come?
"
31607,"- No.
"
31608,"And so there's no one to
"
31609,"walk me down the aisle. And...
"
31610,"Well, I would just really love it
"
31611,"if you would do it.
"
31612,"- Seriously?
"
31613,"- Yeah.
"
31614,"You've, you know,
"
31615,"sort of been like a dad to me.
"
31616,"You've always, you know, looked out
"
31617,"for me and shared your wisdom.
"
31618,"I am pretty ""wisdomous.""
"
31619,"So, what do you say?
"
31620,"Are you kidding?
"
31621,"Phoebe, I would be honored.
"
31622,"Oh, thank you.
"
31623,"I hope...
"
31624,"I hope you know how much
"
31625,"you mean to me.
"
31626,"Listen, I hope...

31627,"I hope that you know...
"
31628,"I don't want you to see your father cry.
"
31629,"Go to your room!
"
31630,"Oh, no, no, no. Let your dad get this.
"
31631,"It's my wedding planner.
"
31632,"She's driving me crazy!
"
31633,"Hello? Okay, stop screaming!
"
31634,"Okay, so halibut.
"
31635,"All right, so salmon.
"
31636,"Either way. I don't...
"
31637,"- It doesn't matter to me.
"
31638,"- Well, it matters to me!
"
31639,"Well, I don't care. So you pick.
"
31640,"Did you just hang up on me?
"
31641,"All right, look, I need you at the
"
31642,"rehearsal dinner tonight at 1800 hours.
"
31643,"Okay. What time is that?
"
31644,"You don't know military time?
"
31645,"I must have been in missile training
"
31646,"the day they taught that.
"
31647,"Just subtract 12.
"
31648,"Okay, so 1800 minus 12...
"
31649,"...is 1788.
"
31650,"- Six o'clock!
"
31651,"- Okay.
"
31652,"Hold on. Yeah? Geller here.
"
31653,"No, I said it has to be there
"
31654,"by 4:00. Goodbye.
"
31655,"How hard is it to make an ice sculpture?
"
31656,"That sounds really fancy.
"
31657,"I told you, I just want a simple wedding.
"
31658,"Please, honey, leave the details to me.
"
31659,"Now, I wanna make this day
"
31660,"as special for you as I can.
"
31661,"I was thinking the harpist
"
31662,"should wear white.
"
31663,"Harpist? My friend Marjorie
"
31664,"is playing the steel drums.
"
31665,"- Oh, she backed out.
"
31666,"- She did? Why?
"
31667,"I made her.
"
31668,"Steel drums don't really say
"
31669,"""elegant wedding.""
"
31670,"- Nor does Marjorie's overwhelming scent.
"
31671,"- Hey!
"
31672,"She will shower when Tibet is free.
"
31673,"- Hey. You look great.
"
31674,"- You too.
"
31675,"I'm glad we're having a rehearsal dinner.
"
31676,"I rarely practice my meals before I eat.
"
31677,"What did we say
"
31678,"was your one gift to us?
"
31679,"No stupid jokes, but I thought
"
31680,"that was for the actual wedding.
"
31681,"Rehearse it.
"
31682,"Hi.
"
31683,"- Thanks for coming, you guys.
"
31684,"- Oh, yeah...
"
31685,"I was...
"
31686,"I was going for a handshake.
"
31687,"That why your hand's
"
31688,"against my crotch?
"
31689,"- That is why.
"
31690,"- Yeah.
"
31691,"So, Rach, where's Emma?
"
31692,"Monica made me send her
"
31693,"to my mom's.
"
31694,"Apparently, babies and weddings
"
31695,"don't mix.
"
31696,"Are you still crying about
"
31697,"your damn baby?
"
31698,"Pheebs, you got to keep the line moving.
"
31699,"Remember, 20 seconds per person.
"
31700,"You see these clowns all the time.
"
31701,"- Hey, you're Mike's parents, right?
"
31702,"- Yes, we are.
"
31703,"Gosh, our little ones
"
31704,"are growing up fast, aren't they?
"
31705,"- How's that?
"
31706,"- You know...
"
31707,"...on one hand, you're happy for them.
"
31708,"On the other, it's hard to let go.
"
31709,"Who in God's name are you?
"
31710,"I'm not that fond of you either, buddy.
"
31711,"I'm just trying to be nice for the kids.
"
31712,"You know what? We have no idea what
"
31713,"we're doing in the wedding tomorrow.
"
31714,"I thought we'd be groomsmen.
"
31715,"They would have asked us by now.
"
31716,"When did they ask you
"
31717,"to be a bridesmaid?
"
31718,"- November.
"
31719,"- I wanna say it's not looking good.
"
31720,"Hey, Pheebs?
"
31721,"You haven't told these guys
"
31722,"what they're doing in the wedding yet.
"
31723,"Well, they're not in the wedding.
"
31724,"What?
"
31725,"Well...
"
31726,"...this is really awkward.
"
31727,"Oh, and I can leave.
"
31728,"I'm sorry, you guys. But Mike's got
"
31729,"his brother and his friends from school.
"
31730,"So, you know, you were...
"
31731,"If it helps, you were next in line.
"
31732,"You just missed the cut.
"
31733,"Oh, man.
"
31734,"This is like figure skating team
"
31735,"all over again.
"
31736,"I mean, synchronized swimming.
"
31737,"I mean...
"
31738,"I mean, the balance beam.
"
31739,"- Help me.
"
31740,"- Football.
"
31741,"Thank you.
"
31742,"Oh, Pheebs, spit that out.
"
31743,"That has pork in it.
"
31744,"I thought the pot stickers
"
31745,"were supposed to be vegetarian?
"
31746,"Yeah, I changed them.
"
31747,"I sent you a fax about it.
"
31748,"I don't have a fax machine.
"
31749,"Well, then there are gonna be
"
31750,"a few surprises.
"
31751,"I can't believe we're gonna be
"
31752,"the only people not in the wedding.
"
31753,"- I know. I hate being left out of things.
"
31754,"- And it's a wedding.
"
31755,"It'll be weird if I'm not in it.
"
31756,"- Hey, guys, how's it going?
"
31757,"- Fine.
"
31758,"We're sitting here, alone, doing nothing.
"
31759,"It's our rehearsal for tomorrow.
"
31760,"Look, about tomorrow,
"
31761,"I've got a question for you.
"
31762,"I found out one of my groomsmen
"
31763,"had an emergency and can't make it.
"
31764,"- What happened?
"
31765,"- Who cares? And...?
"
31766,"And I was wondering
"
31767,"if one of you guys...
"
31768,"- I'll do it!
"
31769,"- Me!
"
31770,"You both wanna do it?
"
31771,"There's only room for one.
"
31772,"Pick me. I look great in a tux,
"
31773,"and I won't steal focus.
"
31774,"No, Mike. No, no, you wanna pick me.
"
31775,"I mean... Watch.
"
31776,"You know, I really don't feel
"
31777,"very comfortable making this decision.
"
31778,"You know, Phoebe knows you better.
"
31779,"I'm gonna let her choose.
"
31780,"Well, if Phoebe's choosing, then say
"
31781,"hello to Mike's next groomsman.
"
31782,"Oh, I will. But I will need a mirror...
"
31783,"...as he is me.
"
31784,"- Please. You're going down.
"
31785,"- You are going ""downer.""
"
31786,"They say that on the
"
31787,"figure skating team?
"
31788,"I wouldn't know. I didn't make it.
"
31789,"You know I'm filling in
"
31790,"for Phoebe's stepdad tomorrow, right?
"
31791,"- Yeah. Yeah. Hey, thanks for doing that.
"
31792,"- Oh, hey, my pleasure.
"
31793,"So, what are your intentions
"
31794,"with my Phoebe?
"
31795,"- I intend to marry her.
"
31796,"- Oh, a wiseacre.
"
31797,"I understand you plan to support
"
31798,"your wife by playing the piano?
"
31799,"Isn't that kind of unstable?
"
31800,"- No more so than acting.
"
31801,"- Strike two.
"
31802,"You're right.
"
31803,"She probably will support me.
"
31804,"Hey, unless we move in with you, Dad.
"
31805,"Strike three.
"
31806,"You only get one more, Mike.
"
31807,"So? What did you decide?
"
31808,"I decided to pee.
"
31809,"You have to choose one of us
"
31810,"to be in your wedding.
"
31811,"- One of the groomsmen fell out.
"
31812,"- Oh, no, no.
"
31813,"I can't choose between you two.
"
31814,"I love you both so much.
"
31815,"Just not enough to put us
"
31816,"in the original wedding party.
"
31817,"But I don't wanna choose.
"
31818,"It's...
"
31819,"- Okay, wait. Rach?
"
31820,"- Yeah?
"
31821,"Listen, I have a very special
"
31822,"bridesmaid task for you to do.
"
31823,"Goody! What is it?
"
31824,"Well, there's a spot open
"
31825,"for only one groomsman...
"
31826,"...and you have to choose between Ross
"
31827,"and Chandler. So good luck with that.
"
31828,"What? What, what, what?
"
31829,"No, I don't wanna do that.
"
31830,"I guess I have to find a new bridesmaid.
"
31831,"I'll do it!
"
31832,"Okay, it's 2100 hours.
"
31833,"- Time for your toast.
"
31834,"- Do I have time to go to the bathroom?
"
31835,"You had a bathroom break at 2030.
"
31836,"Pee on your own time, Mike.
"
31837,"In regards to the toasts, okay,
"
31838,"you wanna keep them short.
"
31839,"Nothing kills a rehearsal dinner
"
31840,"like long speeches. Okay.
"
31841,"You just get in, do your thing,
"
31842,"and get out.
"
31843,"Is that what you say to Chandler?
"
31844,"It's 2101, and I am not amused.
"
31845,"Okay.
"
31846,"The bride and groom
"
31847,"have a few words they'd like to say.
"
31848,"Okay. Hello, everyone.
"
31849,"And thank you all for being here tonight.
"
31850,"So tomorrow's the big event.
"
31851,"Some of you might not know, but Mike
"
31852,"and I didn't get off to the best start.
"
31853,"Yeah. My friend Joey and I...
"
31854,"...decided to fix each other up
"
31855,"with friends. So l...
"
31856,"Oh, okay. I...
"
31857,"I thought about it, and I fixed him up
"
31858,"with my friend Mary Ellen...
"
31859,"...who couldn't be here tonight,
"
31860,"because... It's not...
"
31861,"It's not important.
"
31862,"Well, she's in rehab.
"
31863,"Anyway. So Joey said that he was
"
31864,"fixing me up with his friend Mike...
"
31865,"...only he didn't have a friend Mike,
"
31866,"so he just brought my Mike.
"
31867,"And... And...
"
31868,"But despite, you know...
"
31869,"It got good.
"
31870,"I wanna take a moment to mention
"
31871,"my mother, who couldn't be here.
"
31872,"Oh, God.
"
31873,"And... And moment's over.
"
31874,"So okay... Oh, no, forget that.
"
31875,"I can forget that. Oh, this is funny.
"
31876,"Oh, but you need to know that
"
31877,"to get that.
"
31878,"So...
"
31879,"Oh, well, okay.
"
31880,"I... Okay.
"
31881,"Okay, Monica, I can't do it like this!
"
31882,"This is my wedding, okay?
"
31883,"I don't want this...
"
31884,"Or this... Or this...
"
31885,"Okay? I just wanted a simple wedding...
"
31886,"...where my fiancï¿½ can go
"
31887,"to the bathroom any time he wants!
"
31888,"- You know what? You're done.
"
31889,"- What?
"
31890,"You're fired!
"
31891,"Cheers.
"
31892,"- Hey.
"
31893,"- Happy wedding day.
"
31894,"Happy my wedding day to you.
"
31895,"Joey, listen, this is gonna be
"
31896,"bridesmaid central, all right?
"
31897,"We're gonna have hair and makeup
"
31898,"in the bathroom.
"
31899,"I had to move a couple things in the
"
31900,"fridge to make room for the corsages.
"
31901,"Man! I wouldn't have had breakfast
"
31902,"if I knew there was gonna be corsages.
"
31903,"Hi.
"
31904,"About last night...
"
31905,"I know you're under
"
31906,"a lot of stress, and...
"
31907,"Well, even though the things you said
"
31908,"hurt me a little bit...
"
31909,"My point is...
"
31910,"Well, I'm willing to take my job back.
"
31911,"Oh, well, that's okay.
"
31912,"I think you and I will do much better
"
31913,"if you're just here as a bridesmaid.
"
31914,"Is that so?
"
31915,"Okay.
"
31916,"If that's really what you want,
"
31917,"then here.
"
31918,"I give you the headset. I don't really
"
31919,"wanna give you the headset.
"
31920,"I guess if you're taking over, then you
"
31921,"should probably return these messages.
"
31922,"This is a lot.
"
31923,"But I'm sure you can handle this.
"
31924,"I have won awards...
"
31925,"...for my organizational skills.
"
31926,"But I'm sure you'll do fine.
"
31927,"- You've won awards?
"
31928,"- I printed them out on my computer.
"
31929,"- Hey.
"
31930,"- Hi.
"
31931,"- Where's Rach?
"
31932,"- She's in her room. Why?
"
31933,"I have to talk to her
"
31934,"about this groomsman situation.
"
31935,"I'm not gonna watch Chandler up there
"
31936,"while I'm in the seats like some chump.
"
31937,"My God, you're breathtaking.
"
31938,"What do you want?
"
31939,"You haven't by any chance
"
31940,"chosen a groomsman yet, have you?
"
31941,"Ross, please don't make this
"
31942,"harder than it already is.
"
31943,"I'm not. I'm making it easier. Pick me.
"
31944,"- Chandler said it's important to him too.
"
31945,"- Listen. Listen.
"
31946,"Whoever you pick is gonna
"
31947,"walk down the aisle with you.
"
31948,"Now, I promise I won't say a word.
"
31949,"But if you pick Chandler...
"
31950,"...he's gonna be whispering stupid jokes
"
31951,"in your ear the whole time.
"
31952,"Oh, you are the lesser of two evils.
"
31953,"Yes!
"
31954,"Sven, I don't understand what you're
"
31955,"saying. What is wrong with the flowers?
"
31956,"""Lorkins""? What the hell are ""lorkins""?
"
31957,"I know.
"
31958,"- Hey.
"
31959,"- Mike, if you were Swedish...
"
31960,"...and you were saying the word
"
31961,"""lorkins,"" what flower would that be?
"
31962,"- Orchids?
"
31963,"- Right there!
"
31964,"That's why I'm marrying you.
"
31965,"Hello, Michael.
"
31966,"Joseph.
"
31967,"May I have a word with you, please?
"
31968,"This is...
"
31969,"...great.
"
31970,"Have a seat.
"
31971,"Last night...
"
31972,"...I tried to welcome you into my family.
"
31973,"And instead, you disrespect me.
"
31974,"I cannot allow this.
"
31975,"Are you rehearsing
"
31976,"for some really bad Mafia movie?
"
31977,"More back talk.
"
31978,"And yes, I may be borrowing a few lines
"
31979,"from my recent unsuccessful audition...
"
31980,"...for Family Honor 2:
"
31981,"This A-Time It's A-Personal.
"
31982,"Joey, I kind of have a lot to do today.
"
31983,"What do you want?
"
31984,"I want you to take this seriously!
"
31985,"Phoebe is very,
"
31986,"very important to me, okay?
"
31987,"I wanna make sure
"
31988,"you are gonna take care of her.
"
31989,"Joe, I love Phoebe.
"
31990,"She's the most important thing
"
31991,"in my life.
"
31992,"I'd die before I let
"
31993,"anything happen to her.
"
31994,"That's what I wanted to hear.
"
31995,"Because she's family, okay?
"
31996,"And now you're gonna be family.
"
31997,"And there's nothing more important
"
31998,"in the whole world than family.
"
31999,"That must have been one lousy movie.
"
32000,"That was me!
"
32001,"- Hi.
"
32002,"- Let's talk about this groomsman thing.
"
32003,"If you pick Ross, he'll walk you
"
32004,"down the aisle just fine.
"
32005,"But if you choose me...
"
32006,"...you'll be getting some comedy.
"
32007,"Even so...
"
32008,"...I think I'm gonna pick Ross.
"
32009,"Let me tell you
"
32010,"why you need to pick me.
"
32011,"See, when I was a kid, you know,
"
32012,"I was always left out of everything...
"
32013,"...and it really made me feel insecure.
"
32014,"I was always picked last in gym...
"
32015,"...even behind that fat exchange student
"
32016,"who didn't know the rules to baseball.
"
32017,"I mean, this guy would strike out
"
32018,"and then run to third.
"
32019,"Anyway, if I'm the only one
"
32020,"left out of this wedding...
"
32021,"...I just know that all those feelings
"
32022,"are gonna come rushing back.
"
32023,"All right, fine, I pick you.
"
32024,"Yes!
"
32025,"Make ""groom"" for Chandler.
"
32026,"Oh, my.
"
32027,"No, we're gonna do it my way.
"
32028,"Because your way is stupid.
"
32029,"All right, I got to go.
"
32030,"I have another call, Reverend.
"
32031,"Hello?
"
32032,"- I'm glad we had this little talk.
"
32033,"- Yes.
"
32034,"And thanks for all the
"
32035,"wedding night advice.
"
32036,"That didn't make me
"
32037,"uncomfortable at all.
"
32038,"All right, so I'll see everybody tonight.
"
32039,"- Okay.
"
32040,"- Bye.
"
32041,"Did you guys know that there's
"
32042,"a giant ice sculpture in the hall?
"
32043,"Oh, my God, what's it doing here?
"
32044,"I guess it got sent to the billing address
"
32045,"as opposed to the shipping address.
"
32046,"- What a pickle.
"
32047,"- Oh, my God, everything's such a mess.
"
32048,"Why is this happening to me?
"
32049,"How bad do you wanna
"
32050,"stick your tongue on that?
"
32051,"- How's it going?
"
32052,"- Good.
"
32053,"I'm just getting some coffee
"
32054,"so I'm alert for the wedding.
"
32055,"That's what I was doing too.
"
32056,"Well, you have fun tonight.
"
32057,"- You too.
"
32058,"- Oh, I will.
"
32059,"Me too.
"
32060,"Wait a minute. I know why I'm being
"
32061,"such an ass. Why are you?
"
32062,"- I'm not supposed to tell you.
"
32063,"- I'm not supposed to tell you.
"
32064,"You told us both
"
32065,"we could be in the wedding?
"
32066,"In my defense, you weren't
"
32067,"supposed to tell each other!
"
32068,"Rachel, only one of us can do it.
"
32069,"You have to choose.
"
32070,"You and me together again.
"
32071,"Rach, Rach? Knock-knock.
"
32072,"- Who's there?
"
32073,"- I'll tell you at the wedding.
"
32074,"Hey, I forgot my scarf.
"
32075,"I can't do this. I don't know
"
32076,"which one of you guys to pick.
"
32077,"Oh, you haven't picked yet?
"
32078,"Oh, good, because I had an idea.
"
32079,"I thought it would be fun if the third
"
32080,"groomsman was my family dog, Chappy.
"
32081,"What? A dog?
"
32082,"No. Rachel gets to choose.
"
32083,"Wow, this is a tough one.
"
32084,"I think I'm gonna have to go
"
32085,"with the dog.
"
32086,"So, what you're saying is
"
32087,"that the chef is at the Hamilton Club...
"
32088,"...but the food is not? And the drinks
"
32089,"are there but the bartender is not?
"
32090,"Are you freaking kidding me?
"
32091,"How's it going?
"
32092,"- Help me.
"
32093,"- What?
"
32094,"I want you to be crazy bitch again.
"
32095,"Really?
"
32096,"Please?
"
32097,"- You really want me to come back?
"
32098,"- More than I wanna get married.
"
32099,"Okay, people, we are back in business!
"
32100,"Oh, God, I have missed you
"
32101,"so much. Okay.
"
32102,"Get your hair and makeup done.
"
32103,"I'll take care of everything.
"
32104,"- Hey, what are you guys gonna do?
"
32105,"- About what?
"
32106,"The blizzard.
"
32107,"I just saw on the news...
"
32108,"...it's the worst snowstorm
"
32109,"in 20 years.
"
32110,"They already closed
"
32111,"all the bridges and tunnels.
"
32112,"But the band and the photographer
"
32113,"are coming in from New Jersey.
"
32114,"I don't think they are.
"
32115,"Looks like you're not gonna be
"
32116,"in the wedding, either.
"
32117,"So sorry, Pheebs.
"
32118,"- Well, the club lost its power.
"
32119,"- The news said most of the city did.
"
32120,"- Since when do you watch the news?
"
32121,"- For your information...
"
32122,"...since they hired
"
32123,"a very hot weather girl.
"
32124,"I can't believe you aren't
"
32125,"getting married today.
"
32126,"I know.
"
32127,"It's so beautiful out there. You always
"
32128,"wanted to get married outside.
"
32129,"- Why don't you just do it on the street?
"
32130,"- What?
"
32131,"Well, look, it's hardly snowing anymore.
"
32132,"I mean, you couldn't ask
"
32133,"for a more romantic setting.
"
32134,"This could be the simple wedding
"
32135,"you've always wanted.
"
32136,"What do you think?
"
32137,"I think I wanna get married to you today.
"
32138,"Me too. Monica, do you think
"
32139,"we could do it?
"
32140,"Affirmative!
"
32141,"Okay, let's get these chairs out here!
"
32142,"Gunther, hit the Christmas lights.
"
32143,"Okay, who left the ice sculpture
"
32144,"on the steam grate?
"
32145,"- Michael.
"
32146,"- Hey, you made it. Great. Chappy!
"
32147,"- There you go.
"
32148,"- Hi. Hi.
"
32149,"I know getting married in the street
"
32150,"isn't what you approve of.
"
32151,"No, it's lovely. The lights and the snow.
"
32152,"I could look at them forever.
"
32153,"I crushed a pill and put it in her drink.
"
32154,"Come on, sweetheart.
"
32155,"You know, Chappy's too small
"
32156,"to handle all this snow.
"
32157,"Someone has to
"
32158,"walk him down the aisle.
"
32159,"- Would this person be in the wedding?
"
32160,"- I guess.
"
32161,"- I'll do it!
"
32162,"- I'll do it!
"
32163,"Chandler, hello?
"
32164,"I mean, aren't you scared of dogs?
"
32165,"I'm not scared.
"
32166,"I'll just take little Chappy and...
"
32167,"He can sense my fear!
"
32168,"My throat is exposed!
"
32169,"I guess I'm in the wedding then.
"
32170,"He stinks.
"
32171,"Level one alert! I repeat,
"
32172,"level one, this is not a drill!
"
32173,"We have a situation. The minister called.
"
32174,"He's snowed in, he can't make it.
"
32175,"- Oh, no.
"
32176,"- Hey, don't worry.
"
32177,"- I'm still ordained from your wedding.
"
32178,"- Really?
"
32179,"Yeah. You think I'd give up being
"
32180,"a minister and pay to ride the subway?
"
32181,"Ministers don't ride the subway for free.
"
32182,"I had to read the Bible pretty carefully,
"
32183,"but, yeah, we do.
"
32184,"We have to find someone else
"
32185,"to walk Phoebe down the aisle.
"
32186,"I'll do it!
"
32187,"Okay, Mike and Joey, get in position.
"
32188,"Chandler, come with me.
"
32189,"Okay, Joey's doing the ceremony,
"
32190,"and Chandler's giving you away.
"
32191,"Oh, okay. Hi, new Dad.
"
32192,"So you ready to do this?
"
32193,"Oh, my God. This is really happening.
"
32194,"- Phoebe, I'm so happy for you, honey.
"
32195,"- Thank you.
"
32196,"I love you.
"
32197,"Wait, wait! No hugs! The dresses!
"
32198,"- Oh, what the hell.
"
32199,"- Oh, come on.
"
32200,"- I love you guys.
"
32201,"- I love you.
"
32202,"Okay, it's zero hour!
"
32203,"All teams execute on my count!
"
32204,"Let's get this bad boy on the road!
"
32205,"Is it okay I want you
"
32206,"to wear that headset in bed?
"
32207,"I have you scheduled for nudity
"
32208,"at 2300 hours.
"
32209,"Oh, yeah.
"
32210,"Okay, Marjorie, hit it.
"
32211,"- Jeez, Ross. You could've showered.
"
32212,"- It's the dog.
"
32213,"Groomsman? Why are you standing
"
32214,"there? Where's your bridesmaid?
"
32215,"We've got a broken arrow!
"
32216,"Bridesmaid down!
"
32217,"Oh, that's me.
"
32218,"- Ready?
"
32219,"- Okay.
"
32220,"Oh, wait. Oh, no. Wait.
"
32221,"Wow. Aren't you gonna be cold?
"
32222,"I don't care.
"
32223,"I'll be my ""something blue.""
"
32224,"- You look beautiful.
"
32225,"- Thank you.
"
32226,"My God.
"
32227,"Aren't you freezing?
"
32228,"Friends. Family.
"
32229,"Dog.
"
32230,"Thank you all for being here
"
32231,"to witness this blessed event.
"
32232,"The cold has now spread
"
32233,"to my special place...
"
32234,"...so I'm gonna do
"
32235,"the short version of this.
"
32236,"Phoebe and Mike
"
32237,"are perfect for each other.
"
32238,"And I know I speak for everyone here...
"
32239,"...when I wish them
"
32240,"a lifetime of happiness.
"
32241,"Who has the rings?
"
32242,"Okay.
"
32243,"When I was growing up,
"
32244,"I didn't have a normal mom and dad...
"
32245,"...or a regular family like everybody else.
"
32246,"And I always knew
"
32247,"that something was missing.
"
32248,"But now I'm standing here today...
"
32249,"...knowing that I have everything
"
32250,"I'm ever gonna need.
"
32251,"You are my family.
"
32252,"Phoebe, you are so beautiful.
"
32253,"You're so kind. You're so generous.
"
32254,"You're so wonderfully weird.
"
32255,"Every day with you is an adventure.
"
32256,"And I can't believe how lucky I am.
"
32257,"And I can't wait
"
32258,"to share my life with you forever.
"
32259,"Oh, wait! Oh, I forgot. And...
"
32260,"...I love you.
"
32261,"And you have nice eyes.
"
32262,"I love you too.
"
32263,"- Joey?
"
32264,"- Yeah?
"
32265,"Chappy's heart rate
"
32266,"has slowed way down.
"
32267,"Okay. Phoebe...
"
32268,"...do you take this man
"
32269,"to be your husband?
"
32270,"I do.
"
32271,"Mike, do you take this woman
"
32272,"to be your wife?
"
32273,"I do.
"
32274,"I now pronounce you...
"
32275,"...husband and wife.
"
32276,"I got married!
"
32277,"Could someone get me a coat?
"
32278,"I'm frigging freezing.
"
32279,"- It really was an incredible wedding.
"
32280,"- It was.
"
32281,"I kind of don't want it to end.
"
32282,"Hey...
"
32283,"...you wanna come in for a drink
"
32284,"and a bite of corsage?
"
32285,"I'd love to, but it's 2300 hours...
"
32286,"...and I'm about to have the most
"
32287,"organized sex anyone's ever had.
"
32288,"- Whatever happened to Ross?
"
32289,"- I don't know.
"
32290,"Maybe he hooked up with that
"
32291,"hot girl he talked to.
"
32292,"Come on, Chappy! Do your business!
"
32293,"Make!
"
32294,"Make!
"
32295,"I did not sign on for this.

"
32318,"Yeah, you really shouldn't!
"
32319,"BTW, how was that year-long dig in Cairo?
"
32320,"It was ok.

"
32350,"Well, is she gonna eat all those cookies?
"
32351,"I want the baby to come out all cute and fat.
"
32352,"So why is Erica coming to visit you?
"
32353,"Because we want to get to know her better and...
"
32354,"she's never been to NY, so she wants to see all the tourist spots, you know, Statue of Liberty, Empire State Building...
"
32355,"Oh, those places. There's always so many people there

32359,"Oh hi, thanks for showing up 30 minutes late!
"
32360,"- Ross...
"
32361,"- No no, I'm sure you have a great excuse.
"
32362,"What, was it a hair appointment?
"
32363,"A mani-pedi or is there a sale at Barney's?
"
32364,"My father had a heart attack... while I was at Barney's.
"
32365,"- Oh my god.
"
32366,"- Honey. I'm so sorry.
"
32367,"Is he ok?
"
32368,"Yeah, they said he's gonna be fine.
"
32369,"But he's still having sedated.
"
32370,"Ok, I'm gonna come out to Long Island with you,
"
32371,"I mean, you can't be alone right now.
"
32372,"No, come on, I'm totally ok.
"
32373,"I don't need you to come.
"
32374,"I can totally handle this on my own.
"
32375,"Still, still, let me come... for me.
"
32376,"Ok, if you really need to.
"
32377,"I bet someone could use one of
"
32378,"Monica's freshly baked cookies.
"
32379,"Oh, I really could.
"
32380,"Alright, this seems pretty simple.
"
32381,"Your first line is ""My name is Claude.""
"
32382,"So, just repeat after me.
"
32383,"Well, so let's try it again.
"
32384,"Huh, it's not... quite what I'm saying.
"
32385,"Really? It sounds exactly the same to me.
"
32386,"It does? Really?
"
32387,"Alright, let's just try it again.
"
32388,"- Really listen.
"
32389,"- Got it.

32396,"- Please, sit down.
"
32397,"- Thank you.
"
32398,"It's really nice to meet you guys.
"
32399,"I can't believe I'm here.
"
32400,"Well, welcome to NYC, or should I say ...
"
32401,"Why would you say that?
"
32402,"Ok, what are you gonna be doing today?
"
32403,"Oh, I want to see everything.
"
32404,"Time Square, Coney Island, Rockefeller Center...
"
32405,"Oh, you know what you should do, you should walk
"
32406,"all the way to the top of Statue of Liberty.
"
32407,"- Oh yeah, let's do that!
"
32408,"- Great.
"
32409,"This baby better be really good.
"
32410,"Hi, excuse me. I'm here to see my father.
"
32411,"My name is Rachel Green.
"
32412,"And I'm Dr Ross Galler.
"
32413,"Ross, please. This is a hospital, ok?
"
32414,"That actually means sth here.
"
32415,"- So, can we plase go in?
"
32416,"- Absolutely.
"
32417,"Rach, I think I'm gonna wait out here because...
"
32418,"my throat is feeling a little scratchy,
"
32419,"I don't wanna infect him.
"
32420,"Ross, please, don't be so scared of him.
"
32421,"I am not scared of him, I'm really sick.
"
32422,"He's still under sedation, so he's pretty much out.
"
32423,"I'm feeling better.
"
32424,"Oh, my god.
"
32425,"Oh, wow, that ear and nose hair trimmer I got him
"
32426,"was just money down the drain, huh?
"
32427,"Miss Green, your father's doctor is on the phone
"
32428,"if you'd like to speak to him.
"
32429,"Oh, great. Uh, are you gonna be ok?
"
32430,"He's unconscious, I think we'll be just fine.
"
32431,"Did the TV wake you?
"
32432,"No, when you put your feet up on my bed,
"
32433,"you tucked on my cathode.
"
32434,"Ouchy.
"
32435,"What are you doing here, Galler?
"
32436,"Well, I came with Rachel
"
32437,"who should be back any second.
"
32438,"So what's new?
"
32439,"Ooh, I had a little heart attack.
"
32440,"Great, is it painful?
"
32441,"What? A heart attack is sitting here talking to you.
"
32442,"Let's see if we can get Rachel back in here.
"
32443,"So what's new with you, huh?
"
32444,"Knocked up any more of my daughters laterly?
"
32445,"Nope! Just the one. Rach!
"
32446,"Noo!
"
32447,"Ok, maybe if we just break it down.
"
32448,"Ok, let's just try one syllable at a time.
"
32449,"Ok, so repeat after me.
"
32450,"Great, ok, faster.
"
32451,"Ok, it's too hard, I can't teach you!
"
32452,"What are you doing?
"
32453,"I have to go before pull your head through a wall!
"
32454,"No, no! Don't go, I need you. My audition is tomorrow!
"
32455,"Hey. I was gonna make some dinner but all I found
"
32456,"in your dad's frige was bacon and heavy cream.
"
32457,"I think we solve the mystery of heart attack.
"
32458,"Did you call your parents?
"
32459,"- Oh, yeah, Emma is doing great.
"
32460,"- Oh, good.
"
32461,"Wow.
"
32462,"What?
"
32463,"Just can't believe I'm in Rachel Green's room.
"
32464,"What do you mean? You have been in my room before.
"
32465,"Yeah, sure, right.
"
32466,"Like I have ever been in Rachel Green's room.
"
32467,"Ok, I gotta tell you, it's really weird
"
32468,"when you use my whole name.
"
32469,"Sorry.
"
32470,"- Are you ok?
"
32471,"- Yeah.
"
32472,"'Yeah' to a rough day, huh?
"
32473,"Yeah, it's just so weird seeing him like that, you know?
"
32474,"I mean, he's a doctor,
"
32475,"you don't expect doctors to get sick.
"
32476,"But we do.
"
32477,"You know, he's gonna be ok, Rach.
"
32478,"Oh, I don't want him to wake up alone,
"
32479,"I should go to the hospital.
"
32480,"What? No, no, wait. Hey hey, look.
"
32481,"They gave him a lot medication, ok,
"
32482,"he wouldn't even know if you were there.
"
32483,"Look, we'll go and see him
"
32484,"the first thing in the morning, ok?
"
32485,"- Really? I shouldn't feel guilty?
"
32486,"- No, God. Hey.
"
32487,"Rach, you've been an amazing doughter, ok?
"
32488,"Right now, you just need to get some rest.
"
32489,"Ok, maybe you're right.
"
32490,"Good night.
"
32491,"Wait, wait.
"
32492,"Would you stay here with me for a while?
"
32493,"Sure.
"
32494,"Thank you for coming with me today.
"
32495,"Oh, of course.
"
32496,"Rachel Green is very happy you're in her room.
"
32497,"Me, too. Come here.
"
32498,"I just don't want to be alone tonight.
"
32499,"Ok, well, I can, maybe grab a sleeping bag or...
"
32500,"No, Rach!
"
32501,"I'm sorry, I just don't think this is a good idea.
"
32502,"We won't know that until we do it, will we?
"
32503,"No, uh look, uhm...
"
32504,"You are upset about your father
"
32505,"and you're feeling vulnerable.
"
32506,"And I just don't feel it will be right
"
32507,"if I'd like be, you know, taking advantage of you.
"
32508,"What taking advantage?
"
32509,"I'm giving you the advantage, enjoy!
"
32510,"Ok, I'm sure it would be great but...
"
32511,"I think one of us has to be thinking clearly,
"
32512,"so I'm gonna go.
"
32513,"I'll see you in the morning.
"
32514,"Haven't had sex in 4 months,
"
32515,"I should get a medal for that!
"
32516,"Thanks so much for taking me to all these places,
"
32517,"I had a great time.
"
32518,"Oh, I'm glad. Listen, I want to apologize
"
32519,"about Chandler, though.
"
32520,"I just did not see this coming.
"
32521,"NY is awesome!
"
32522,"What is with you?
"
32523,"You know, I've been to these before
"
32524,"but I've never really seen them, you know?
"
32525,"Yeah, you missed a lot when you were mooing.
"
32526,"Thanks so much for showing me around.
"
32527,"Oh, it was our pleasure.
"
32528,"We're so much enjoying getting to know you.
"
32529,"Well, is there anything else you want to know?
"
32530,"Oh, uh, ok.
"
32531,"Do you mind if I ask you some questions
"
32532,"about the father?
"
32533,"Oh, sure, yeah.
"
32534,"Well, he was my high school boyfriend,
"
32535,"captain of the football team, really cute.
"
32536,"And he got a scholarship, went off to college.
"
32537,"That's great.
"
32538,"Yeah, it's almost definitely him.
"
32539,"How is that now?
"
32540,"Well, there is a chance it's another guy.
"
32541,"I mean, I've only ever been with 2 guys
"
32542,"but they sorta overlapped.
"
32543,"So, what does the other guy do?
"
32544,"Does he go to the college, too?
"
32545,"No, he's in prison.
"
32546,"Uh, was he falsely accused of sth?
"
32547,"No. He killed his father with a shovel.
"
32548,"But other than that he's a great guy.
"
32549,"I'll bet his dad doesn't think so.
"
32550,"- Are you awake?
"
32551,"- Of course I'm awake.
"
32552,"As so from now on I'm always awake.
"
32553,"Alright, we don't know that it's him.
"
32554,"I mean, it could be the football guy.
"
32555,"Honey, it's us. Of course it's the shovel killer.
"
32556,"Alright, alright, let's say it is him.
"
32557,"Would we not want baby? No.
"
32558,"Would we treat him any differently?
"
32559,"I'll keep an eye on him.
"
32560,"- We have to find out which one the father is.
"
32561,"- How?
"
32562,"I don't know, there're tests for these things, right?
"
32563,"Yeah, but maybe we're just overreacting.
"
32564,"Easy for you to say. He's a father killer.
"
32565,"He probably loves his mommy.
"
32566,"He's probably got a tattoo says ""Mom""
"
32567,"on the shovel wielding arm.
"
32568,"""We'll now count from 1 to 5: .....""
"
32569,"- ""Good job!""
"
32570,"- Thank you.
"
32571,"Hey, Joey.
"
32572,"Listen, I feel really badly about yesterday
"
32573,"and I thought it about a lot know I was too inpatient.
"
32574,"So let's try it again.
"
32575,"Oh no, that's ok. I don't need your help.
"
32576,"I work it out on myself and I gotta say I'm pretty good.
"
32577,"Really? Can I hear some of them?
"
32578,"Sure, sure.
"
32579,"Ok.
"
32580,"See?
"
32581,"Alright, you're not, you're not...
"
32582,"Again, you're not SPEAKING FRENCH!
"
32583,"Oh, well I think I am, yeah.
"
32584,"And I think I'm definitely gonna get the part.
"
32585,"How could you possibly think that?
"
32586,"For one thing, the guy on the tape said
"
32587,"I was doing a good job!
"
32588,"Hi, Rach, can you grab me a cup of coffee?
"
32589,"Sure.
"
32590,"You've been quiet all morning, is everything ok?
"
32591,"- You sure you are alright.
"
32592,"- Yep.
"
32593,"Ookay. Uhm, well I'm gonna go grab some breakfast.
"
32594,"- FYI...
"
32595,"- There it is.
"
32596,"In the future, when a girl asks for
"
32597,"some ill-advised sympathy sex, just do it.
"
32598,"Wait, wait, you're mad at me about last night?
"
32599,"I was just trying to do the right thing.
"
32600,"Really? Well it seems to me if you've done the right thing, I would not have woken up today feeling stupid and embarrassed,
"
32601,"I would have woken up feeling comforted and satisfied.
"
32602,"- Well...
"
32603,"- Oh, stop that!
"
32604,"I can't believe this. What do you...
"
32605,"I was just being a good guy.
"
32606,"I treated you with respect and understanding.
"
32607,"Ahh, that is so hot.
"
32608,"Hey, I was looking out for you.
"
32609,"Oh, really? Well Ross, you know what? I am a big girl,
"
32610,"I don't need someone telling me what is best for me.
"
32611,"I gotta say I have not had sex a lot times before,
"
32612,"this is the worst ever.
"
32613,"Oh really, really?
"
32614,"Well, it wasn't very good for me, either.
"
32615,"Oh, ok, you know, hey hey! You know what?
"
32616,"To avoid this little thing in the future,
"
32617,"let's just say you and me, never having sex again.
"
32618,"What?
"
32619,"That's right, sex is off the table!
"
32620,"I'm never having sex with you again.
"
32621,"Dr Green, are you feeling better?
"
32622,"Hey, how was lunch?
"
32623,"We had a good time.
"
32624,"BTW, I want to ask you sth.
"
32625,"It would really mean a lot to me.
"
32626,"If the baby is a boy, would you
"
32627,"name him after my father Jiminy Billy Bob?
"
32628,"Oh, really?
"
32629,"Noo. You were right, that was fun.
"
32630,"I'm gonna go finish packing.
"
32631,"So, is she gonna take the test?
"
32632,"No, she doesn't have to.
"
32633,"I found out who the father is.
"
32634,"Oh, God, it's Shovelly Joe, isn't it?
"
32635,"No, it's not.
"
32636,"How do you know?
"
32637,"Well, it turns out that
"
32638,"Erica didn't pay much attention in sex ed class.
"
32639,"Because the thing she did with the prison guy
"
32640,"would be pretty hard to make a baby that way.
"
32641,"Oh, God. What was it? The thing
"
32642,"we hardly ever do or the thing we never do?
"
32643,"The thing we never do.
"
32644,"Shovelly Joe.
"
32645,"- Whenever you're ready, Joey.
"
32646,"- Right.
"
32647,"I'm sorry, what's going on?
"
32648,"Dude, come on. French it up.
"
32649,"Joey, do you speak French?
"
32650,"You know what, I think this audition is over.
"
32651,"Uh, excuse me?
"
32652,"Uh, I am Ugeon Phillogne.
"
32653,"I was passing by when I heard this man speaking
"
32654,"the regional dialect of my French town of Estelloude.
"
32655,"You really think this man is speaking French.
"
32656,"Good job, little buddy.
"
32657,"That was some really good French.
"
32658,"But I think we're gonna go with someone else for the part.
"
32659,"Oh, alright. But my French was good?
"
32660,"It was great.
"
32661,"Merci.
"
32662,"- Emmas's down for the night.
"
32663,"- Oh, good.
"
32664,"So, I guess I'm gonna takeoff.
"
32665,"Hey, listen, just before you go, I...
"
32666,"Again I just wanna say 'thank you' for coming with me.
"
32667,"Oh, no problem.
"
32668,"And also, you know I...
"
32669,"I was thinking about what you said,
"
32670,"uh, you know, about the whole sex thing and...
"
32671,"Probably not a great idea to go down that road again.
"
32672,"Thank you. I'm glad you agree.
"
32673,"It's shame though, I mean, when we did it,
"
32674,"it was pretty good.
"
32675,"Yeah, yeah, that's true.
"
32676,"Hey, do you remember that one really great time?
"
32677,"Oh, yeah.
"
32678,"- You know, it was your birthday...
"
32679,"- It was Valentine's day...
"
32680,"- Oh, yeah.
"
32681,"- Oh, yeah.
"
32682,"Well, I guess that's all the past now.
"
32683,"Uh-huh.
"
32684,"- Not even one more time.
"
32685,"- Not even once.
"
32686,"- No matter how much we want it.
"
32687,"- Even if we want it REALLY bad.
"
32688,"That's what WE decided.
"
32689,"Right.
"
32690,"- It's kinda hard, though.
"
32691,"- Yeah.
"
32692,"You know? When two people have a connection,
"
32693,"you know, that's...
"
32694,"just seems like... such a waste.
"
32695,"I hate waste.
"
32696,"- Ross...
"
32697,"- Yes.
"
32698,"Just so you know,
"
32699,"with us, it's never off the table.
"
32700,"Dammit, it's never off the table.
"
32701,"Ok, can you really tap dance?
"
32702,"No.
"
32703,"Off the resume.
"
32704,"- Archery?
"
32705,"- No.
"
32706,"- Horseback riding?
"
32707,"- Would fall off a lot.
"
32708,"You can drink a gallon of milk in 10 seconds?
"
32709,"That I can do.
"
32710,"Come on, you can drink a GALLON of milk
"
32711,"in 10 seconds?
"
32712,"Alright, watch me!
"
32713,"Ok, your time, are you ready?
"
32714,"Ready, go!
"
32715,"You did it!

"
32718,"How did the job stuff go?
"
32719,"He offered me one.
"
32720,"You know what?
"
32721,"This calls for a bottle of Israels finest.
"
32722,"The job is in Paris.
"
32723,"Oh, God! Please, somebody say something.
"
32724,"So if you take this job you'll be moving to Paris?
"
32725,"Or facing a bitch of a commute.
"
32726,"I know, it's huge
"
32727,"and it's scary,
"
32728,"and it's... really far, far away from you guys
"
32729,"but this is such an incredible opportunity for me.
"
32730,"And I've already talked to them about our situation with Emma
"
32731,"and they said they'll do whatever we need to make us feel comfortable.
"
32732,"- Okay.
"
32733,"- I mean, I'll fly back and forth
"
32734,"- they'll fly you out... Anything we want.
"
32735,"- My boss said I might be getting a new lamp in my cubicle.
"
32736,"All right, we'll work it out.
"
32737,"Thank you! Thank you!
"
32738,"Yeah, yeah!
"
32739,"You sure this is what you want?
"
32740,"I think it is.
"
32741,"Ooh, what's going on?
"
32742,"I got a really incredible job offer.
"
32743,"Hey, great! All right!
"
32744,"Good for you!
"
32745,"It's in Paris.
"
32746,"What?
"
32747,"No, no, no!
"
32748,"No, no... no... no, no...
"
32749,"No, too much is changing, okay?
"
32750,"First, Phoebe getting married
"
32751,"Congratulations!
"
32752,"nd then these two move into a stupid house in the stupid suburbs...
"
32753,"Hey, this afternoon you said you'd be supportive...
"
32754,"Well, it comes and goes. I wouldn't trust it.
"
32755,"Look, you guys...
"
32756,"this is really, really important to me.
"
32757,"And it means a lot if you could try to get on board.
"
32758,"Of course we can. Congratulations.
"
32759,"Yay!
"
32760,"- Joey...
"
32761,"- No, no, no.
"
32762,"My hugs are reserved for people STAYING IN AMERICA.
"
32763,"Joey, it would mean so...
"
32764,"Hey! No!
"
32765,"Get your France-going-arms away from me.
"
32766,"Joey...
"
32767,"You okay with this?
"
32768,"Well, it makes me feel sad, but...
"
32769,"Talking to Ross.
"
32770,"I see.
"
32771,"Well, Rachel moving to another country?
"
32772,"Not being able to see her every day.
"
32773,"How can I be okay with this?
"
32774,"I know, but what are we gonna do?
"
32775,"She really needs this job.
"
32776,"Do you think if the Ralph Lauren people offered her her old job back, she would take it?
"
32777,"How is that gonna happen?
"
32778,"Is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes?
"
32779,"I don't know.
"
32780,"I could talk to her boss.
"
32781,"Yeah! I met him at that Christmas party.
"
32782,"We really hit it off.
"
32783,"You mean the guy who kept calling you Ron?

"
32790,"Hey, tell me what you think.
"
32791,"All right.
"
32792,"The house next door to the one that we're buying in Westchester?
"
32793,"Just went on the market.
"
32794,"I wanna take a look at it, but Chandler doesn't.
"
32795,"We close escrow tomorrow, so seeing another house can only confuse us
"
32796,"and we're easily confused. We're not very bright.
"
32797,"But what if it is better than ours?
"
32798,"Should we at least look?
"
32799,"What do you think Pheebs?
"
32800,"Well, I think that shirt makes you look like you should work at a Baskin Robbins...
"
32801,"Anyway...
"
32802,"Hey, isn't Joey's agent Estelle Leonard?
"
32803,"Yeah.
"
32804,"She died.
"
32805,"You're kidding!
"
32806,"That's terrible!
"
32807,"Yeah, last Saturday. Wow!
"
32808,"She was the first black man to fly solo across the Atlantic.
"
32809,"Oh, wait a minute, I read the wrong one.
"
32810,"Oh yeah?
"
32811,"Yeah, she was just an agent.
"
32812,"Joey's gonna be so upset.
"
32813,"I know. He always wanted to be the first black man to cross the Atlantic.
"
32814,"Well, we cannot tell Joey about this.
"
32815,"He's already flipping out about everything that's changing.
"
32816,"This will push him over the edge.
"
32817,"Seriously, you don't think we should tell him?
"
32818,"Well, not for a little while.
"
32819,"Let's just give him a few days to get used to everything else.
"
32820,"What if he reads it in the paper?
"
32821,"Unless Snoopy says it to Charlie Brown, I think we're okay.
"
32822,"May I help you?
"
32823,"Yeah, I'm a friend of Rachel Green's.
"
32824,"Uhm, actually we met at the Christmas party about two years ago.
"
32825,"Oh right, uhm, Don?
"
32826,"Close. Ron.
"
32827,"Uh... What can I do for you?
"
32828,"Uhm, well...
"
32829,"I'm here to see if you'll give Rachel her job back.
"
32830,"Ah, did she ask you to come here and do this?
"
32831,"Oh, no.
"
32832,"Then we'll see if she wants to come back.
"
32833,"At first I have to get you to agree.
"
32834,"Wow, that is tempting.
"
32835,"Look, she loved her job here.
"
32836,"And let's face it you're not gonna find anyone who did it as well as she did it.
"
32837,"Isn't that true?
"
32838,"She is good!
"
32839,"Huh, I took a shot there.
"
32840,"But I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do...
"
32841,"Ah, it's not true, there is... nothing I want to do.
"
32842,"I see... Thanks very much.
"
32843,"Is this your son?
"
32844,"Yeah, his name is Ross.
"
32845,"What?
"
32846,"Oh, nothing, it's just, it's close to Ron.
"
32847,"Does he.. Does little Ross like dinosaurs by any chance?
"
32848,"Yeah, they're all he talks about, why?
"
32849,"How would he like to come with me to the Museum of Natural History
"
32850,"after everyone else has left
"
32851,"just the two of us,
"
32852,"and he can touch anything he wants.
"
32853,"I just heard it as you must have heard it and that's not good.
"
32854,"Let me start again.
"
32855,"I'm a paleontologist
"
32856,"you'll be there with us and the touching refers only to bones - fossils!
"
32857,"You can really arrange that?
"
32858,"You let Rachel come back, and it's done.
"
32859,"Well, I guess having Rachel back wouldn't be the worst thing in the world.
"
32860,"Yeah! Yes! Thank you! This is great.
"
32861,"Thank you so much.
"
32862,"And I swear, your kid is going to have the time of his life.
"
32863,"That's great. I worry about little Ross.
"
32864,"He's always reading, he's collecting rocks and he's obsessed with dinosaurs.
"
32865,"He'll be fine.
"
32866,"Hey Phoebe.
"
32867,"Hey. Everything ok?
"
32868,"I'm just mad at my agent.
"
32869,"Estelle? Why?
"
32870,"There's a part in a TV movie that I would be perfect for and I didn't even be put up for it!
"
32871,"She'd better have a good reason.
"
32872,"I'm guessing she does.
"
32873,"Well
"
32874,"I'm wanna hear it, because she keeps doing this.
"
32875,"Well, no, no, wait, wait, wait.
"
32876,"All right, I gotta go.
"
32877,"Just listen.
"
32878,"Promise me, that you will wait a minute before you call her.
"
32879,"Ok. Why?
"
32880,"Because a promise between friends means never having to give a reason.
"
32881,"I love that saying!
"
32882,"Hello?
"
32883,"Joey, it's Estelle.
"
32884,"I was just gonna call you! That's weird.
"
32885,"It's a little coincidental, but believable.
"
32886,"Listen, I'm sure you're wondering
"
32887,"why I didn't get you an audition for that TV movie.
"
32888,"Yeah, actually I am!
"
32889,"I guess I dropped the ball there. Whoopsie!
"
32890,"That's it? You know, it seems all you do lately is drop the ball.
"
32891,"Don't take that tone with me. Who you think you are?
"
32892,"Alan Lemond, the first black man to fly solo across the Atlantic?
"
32893,"No, no, look.
"
32894,"All I'm saying is that you're my agent, ok?
"
32895,"And you're not getting me into any auditions and I'm tired of it.
"
32896,"What are you saying?
"
32897,"I'm saying that
"
32898,"This isn't working for me anymore, ok?
"
32899,"Estelle, you're fired. Goodbye.
"
32900,"Man, tough week for Estelle!
"
32901,"Hi.
"
32902,"Hi.
"
32903,"Emma left her stuffed t-rex at my house.
"
32904,"You know she can't sleep without it.
"
32905,"Oh, well, she's asleep now. Stop forcing that thing on her.
"
32906,"Ok.
"
32907,"Oh, you're not gonna believe what happened to me today!
"
32908,"Ralph Lauren called, and gave me my job back!
"
32909,"Nooo!
"
32910,"Yee. I mean, it was so weirdest thing.
"
32911,"They fired me and then out of nowhere they just hire me back!
"
32912,"I mean, that place must have been falling apart without me.
"
32913,"So, you're not going to Paris.
"
32914,"No, I'm still going.
"
32915,"Wh - wh - what?
"
32916,"When the Louis Vuitton people found out that Ralph Lauren wanted me back
"
32917,"- they offered me more money!
"
32918,"Isn't that great?
"
32919,"- Yeeeah!
"
32920,"Hi. We're buying the house next door
"
32921,"and we were wondering if we could just take a look around.
"
32922,"Oh, sure. I'm showing it to someone else right now but please, look around.
"
32923,"Thanks.
"
32924,"It feels like we're cheating on our house.
"
32925,"And if we're gonna cheat, shouldn't it be with like a hot younger house,
"
32926,"that does stuff that our house won't do?
"
32927,"Ours is so much better!
"
32928,"This living room is smaller, the dining room looks like a cave!
"
32929,"What a hole!
"
32930,"So? What do you think?
"
32931,"Love it!
"
32932,"Well, we already have one offer on it
"
32933,"and I think the lady upstairs is goning to make another one.
"
32934,"They could be our neighbors, what are they like?
"
32935,"Oh, the woman upstairs is very nice.
"
32936,"She and her husband have two kids, he's on Wall Street and she -
"
32937,"Oh my God!
"
32938,"Sure.
"
32939,"Hey Joey, want come with me to
"
32940,"- are you ok?
"
32941,"Yeah, I just - I just feel bad about firing Estelle.
"
32942,"This is got to be killing her.
"
32943,"No, that wouldn't kill her. Ordinary embolism might.
"
32944,"I don't know.
"
32945,"She's got to be taking it hard, I was like her only client.
"
32946,"Except for this guy who eats paper.
"
32947,"And I'm guessing he eats more money than he makes.
"
32948,"Look, I know she's not a great agent, but she did stick with me for ten years.
"
32949,"I'm gonna call her and hire her again.
"
32950,"No, no, no! Don't call her!
"
32951,"You wait for her to call you
"
32952,"- Why?
"
32953,"- Because patience is the road to understanding
"
32954,"which ... is the key... to a happy heart.
"
32955,"You blow me away.
"
32956,"All right, so promise you're gonna wait for her to call you?
"
32957,"I promise. And that means, never having to give a reason.
"
32958,"What a small world!
"
32959,"And yet I never run into Beyoncï¿½ï¿½!
"
32960,"You two know each other?
"
32961,"Oh, we go way back. Before Monica made an honest man out of him
"
32962,"Chandler used to be my little love muffin!heh-heh-heh!.
"
32963,"So? Are you guys thinking of getting this house too?
"
32964,"Ooh! Are we gonna have a bidding war?
"
32965,"I'd better warn you, I'm a toughie Don't, don't!
"
32966,"No, actually, we're buying the house next door.
"
32967,"Why!?
"
32968,"I don't know why.
"
32969,"Ooh, that decides it then.
"
32970,"I was on the fence.
"
32971,"But knowing that you two would be our neighbors?
"
32972,"Ah! now we have to get it! Ellen, we're going to talk numbers.
"
32973,"This can not be happening!
"
32974,"Okay, the realtor said another couple made an offer.
"
32975,"Maybe the Janice's won't get it! Maybe the other couple will.
"
32976,"The only way that that is going to happen, is if the other couple are the Hitlers.
"
32977,"Okay, Okay
"
32978,"All right. What if we got both houses?
"
32979,"Huh? We can turn this house into a guest house.
"
32980,"That is a great idea!
"
32981,"And by the way, I don't mean to sound distasteful
"
32982,"but when did you start crapping money!?
"
32983,"Okay, you come up with an idea.
"
32984,"Alright alright
"
32985,"we still have three hours till escrow closes on our house
"
32986,"We can still get out.
"
32987,"But we love our house.
"
32988,"Will we love it so much with her next door?
"
32989,"And she's gonna be louder out here too.
"
32990,"Just the crickets and ""Oh My God""!
"
32991,"Okay, but if we don't get this house
"
32992,"she's still gonna show up wherever we go!
"
32993,"I mean, at least if she's here, it eliminates the element of surprise.
"
32994,"I mean, never again will you have to hear the three words ..
"
32995,"...that make your balls jump back up inside your body.
"
32996,"Well, we have to do something.
"
32997,"We can't have her living next door.
"
32998,"Oh, that does it too.
"
32999,"Who is it?
"
33000,"It's me. Ron.
"
33001,"Look, I um, I now Rachel turned you down
"
33002,"but I think there is a way you might be able to get her to come back.
"
33003,"This may surprise you
"
33004,"but re-hiring fired employees, is not my main job.
"
33005,"Just hear me out.
"
33006,"How would you feel about offering her a raise?
"
33007,"Not good, Ron.
"
33008,"Perhaps I can persuade you.
"
33009,"What if you can give your son this genuine pterodactyl egg replica.
"
33010,"Wow, that's pretty cool
"
33011,"Huh? So? We have a deal?
"
33012,"Okay, you got it.
"
33013,"Yes! yes!
"
33014,"This is gonna make me very popular.
"
33015,"Oh, Believe me, the ladies, they love it!
"
33016,"I meant with my son.
"
33017,"Good, 'cause the ladies, not so much.
"
33018,"Joey, this is Al T. Booker,the guy who eats paper.
"
33019,"I'm sure you've heard that Estelle passed away.
"
33020,"I wanted to let you know there's a memorial for her ...
"
33021,"...at the Westside chapel, tomorrow at ten.
"
33022,"Hope you can make it.
"
33023,"Oh my God.
"
33024,"Hello?
"
33025,"Joey, it's Estelle.
"
33026,"Estelle?
"
33027,"Yeah, I wanted to call and tell you that there's no hard feelings for firing me.
"
33028,"Ok-ay. I just, I can't believe you're calling me?
"
33029,"Well, I didn't think I should just drop by...
"
33030,"No, no, no! Don't drop by, don't drop by!
"
33031,"Anyway, you did what you had to do. I'm okay.
"
33032,"Can I ask you something?
"
33033,"Uhm, what's it like there?
"
33034,"It's alright. Look kiddo, I gotta go.
"
33035,"Good luck with the career. You're gonna be huge.
"
33036,"Thanks for everything Estelle. Bye.
"
33037,"""out of area"". Boy, I'll say.
"
33038,"Well... I just talked to Sid
"
33039,"we are definitely putting in an offer on the house...
"
33040,"a-a-and I'll bet we get it.
"
33041,"The Hitlers will be so disappointed.
"
33042,"All right, I got to run. Tell Monica I say goodbye.
"
33043,"And... I'll see you later, neighbor.
"
33044,"Wait! I just want you to know that...
"
33045,"I'm so happy you're going to be here.
"
33046,"Oh, me too...
"
33047,"Because... that way...
"
33048,"we can pick up where we left off.
"
33049,"Huh?
"
33050,"I never stopped loving you.
"
33051,"Oh... my...
"
33052,"Yeah, yeah, yeah! I want you... I need you...
"
33053,"I must have you Janice Litman Goralnik Neihosenstein.
"
33054,"Chandler, what are you talking about?
"
33055,"Now that you live next door, we can be together every day.
"
33056,"Sid and Monica never have to know a thing.
"
33057,"I don't know what to say...
"
33058,"I mean, you know, obviously we have this... heat between us.
"
33059,"Obviously.
"
33060,"But I love my husband. And I know you love your wife.
"
33061,"Now, I don't think we should get this house now.
"
33062,"Don't say that. Don't tangle the dream and take it away.
"
33063,"Chandler, one of us has got to be strong.
"
33064,"I understand.
"
33065,"Although, maybe just... one last moment of weakness...
"
33066,"Goodbye Chandler Bing.
"
33067,"They're never coming down now.
"
33068,"Hi!
"
33069,"Hey!
"
33070,"You are never going to believe what happened to me today.
"
33071,"What?
"
33072,"Ralph Lauren called again and they offered me more money.
"
33073,"They did?
"
33074,"Yeah. It was the weirdest thing.
"
33075,"Zelner called me and he said we'll do everything we can to get you back.
"
33076,"And that I should thank some Ron...
"
33077,"I don't even know what department that guy's in.
"
33078,"So, what are you gonna do?
"
33079,"Well, I took it.
"
33080,"That's great! So you're staying in New York!
"
33081,"YAY! WHOO! YAY!
"
33082,"You're excited, right?
"
33083,"Ye-ah. Yeah! You know, the money's great.
"
33084,"It's certainly the easier choice...
"
33085,"Right!
"
33086,"Yeah, you know, was I looking forward to going to Paris?
"
33087,"Sure. You know, was I excited about working in the fashion capital of the world?
"
33088,"Ooh, absolutely...
"
33089,"Oh...! Yeah, but you know, this is... it's fine.
"
33090,"I'm fine going back to a job where I've pretty much gotten everything out of that I possibly can...
"
33091,"Uhm, I hadn't no you...
"
33092,"I had no idea you were so excited about Paris.
"
33093,"Uhm, I mean, you said you were scared.
"
33094,"Well yeah, but I mean, it was good scared though, you know?
"
33095,"Like when I-moved-to-New-York scared.
"
33096,"Or uhm, when I-found-out-I-was-gonna-have-Emma scared...
"
33097,"But this is... fine. This is gonna be good.
"
33098,"You should go.
"
33099,"What?
"
33100,"It's what you want. You should go.
"
33101,"You really think so?
"
33102,"I really do.
"
33103,"But I already told Zelner that I would come back...
"
33104,"I'm sure he'll understand.
"
33105,"All right. ALL RIGHT! I'm gonna do it.
"
33106,"I'm gonna go to Paris.
"
33107,"Yeah...
"
33108,"Yeah! I'm going to Paris. Thank you, Ross!
"
33109,"Yeah, yeah, oh!
"
33110,"Oh! Oh, I'm so happy.
"
33111,"Then I'm happy too.
"
33112,"Thank you all for coming.
"
33113,"We're here today to pay respects to a wonderful agent and a beautiful woman...
"
33114,"..inside.
"
33115,"As Estelle's only two clients we would like to say a few words.
"
33116,"Dude, where's my speech?
"
33117,"That is entertaining. Al Zebooker everybody.
"
33118,"<font color=""#ffff00"" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net
"
33119,"Alright, let's play one more time, okay?
"
33120,"And remember, if I win you do not move to Paris.
"
33121,"Okay.
"
33122,"Can't beIieve I'm risking this again, but you're on!
"
33123,"Alright Joe, you remember the rules.
"
33124,"Heads I win, tales you lose.
"
33125,"Just flip!
"
33126,"Dark tails!
"
33127,"Damn it!
"
33128,"Hey, so we thought we'd throw you a little going away party around 7.
"
33129,"Oh, that sounds good!
"
33130,"Hey Rach, you're leaving tomorrow.
"
33131,"Shouldn't you be packing?
"
33132,"It's all done!
"
33133,"Oh yeah, right.
"
33134,"And after I took a shower this morning
"
33135,"I just threw my towel on the floor!
"
33136,"Oh, God!
"
33137,"It hurts to even joke about it.
"
33138,"I know... honey, seriously I did it all.
"
33139,"The luggage that I'm taking is in the bedroom. This is Emma's Paris stuff,
"
33140,"... these are boxes that I'm having shipped,
"
33141,"... and that's the sandwich I made for the plane...
"
33142,"Okay, so you've done some good work.
"
33143,"What about your carry-ons?
"
33144,"Oh well, everything that I need is in here,
"
33145,"and my travel documents are on the counter
"
33146,"... organized in the order that I will be needing them.
"
33147,"Oh my God! I have nothing left to teach you!
"
33148,"Where's your passport?
"
33149,"It should be right next to my plane ticket.
"
33150,"- Well, it's not.
"
33151,"- What?
"
33152,"Maybe I put it in here...
"
33153,"Oh, oh, it's not in there!
"
33154,"Oh no...
"
33155,"I must have packed it in one of these boxes!
"
33156,"Here, let me help you.
"
33157,"Shoot...
"
33158,"Oh, I can't believe I did this!
"
33159,"At what point did it stop being funny
"
33160,"that I took her passport?

33168,"Oh, wow, can you believe you're really 3 weeks away?
"
33169,"I know.
"
33170,"You don't mind me touching your belly, do you?
"
33171,"No, I don't mind you touching my belly,
"
33172,"... but right now your hand's kinda blocking
"
33173,"the part where baby's gonna come out.
"
33174,"- Hey!
"
33175,"- Hi.
"
33176,"- Hey Erica, welcome back to town!
"
33177,"Wow, look how big you've gotten.
"
33178,"That's because I 'm pregnant!
"
33179,"Right, no, I... I understand.
"
33180,"Oh, okay! I'm just always afraid that
"
33181,"people think I'm just fat with big breasts.
"
33182,"No, no, I knew.
"
33183,"Okay, well, stop staring at them!
"
33184,"She brought them up!
"
33185,"I didn't realize you were coming back so soon!
"
33186,"Hey, well, in a couple of weeks I won't be able to travel.
"
33187,"Yeah, and I wanted her to get to know the doctors
"
33188,"and get settled into the hotel.
"
33189,"Hotel? Why isn't she staying with you guys?
"
33190,"Because we're moving in a couple of days
"
33191,"and it just didn't make sense.
"
33192,"Plus hotels are fun!
"
33193,"My room has this little fridge full of free snacks.
"
33194,"Erica, those things aren't free.
"
33195,"In fact they have one of the highest markups
"
33196,"in any consumer product...
"
33197,"Ross! She's giving us her baby.
"
33198,"She can eat you if she wants.
"
33199,"I'll be right back.
"
33200,"- Oh man, I can't believe you guys are leaving this place.
"
33201,"- Oh, I know, I know.
"
33202,"Hey, you know you can take it if you want!
"
33203,"The lease is still in Nana's name!
"
33204,"No no. This will always be your place.
"
33205,"It would be too sad.
"
33206,"Plus, how much a month does it cost to feed Joey?
"
33207,"Yeah, it takes 2 incomes.
"
33208,"Hey, is Chandler here?
"
33209,"We talked about catching a movie.
"
33210,"Oh, no. He doesn't have time for that.
"
33211,"But if you want you can go help
"
33212,"him and Joey pack up the guest room.
"
33213,"Mhm, packing - sexy cheerleader comedy.
"
33214,"Mhm, helpful brother - creepy loner at teen movie.
"
33215,"What are you guys doing?
"
33216,"Try it,
"
33217,"I can't feel a thing!
"
33218,"Are, are you kidding?
"
33219,"This is packing?
"
33220,"- We are taking a break!
"
33221,"- From...?
"
33222,"Jumping on the bed?
"
33223,"Alright, Rachel's party is in a couple of hours
"
33224,"and there's a lot to do!
"
33225,"Now, Ross, you got Geller blood,
"
33226,"you are in charge of these yahoos!
"
33227,"- You got it!
"
33228,"- Alright.
"
33229,"Alright, she's right. We gotta get serious.
"
33230,"Let's put styrofoam peanuts down his pants
"
33231,"and kick him!
"
33232,"No, no, no, guys. She's right.
"
33233,"We should get to work.
"
33234,"I'll take stuff out of the closet,
"
33235,"... Joey, you pack 'em,
"
33236,"and Ross you re-pack whatever Joey packs.
"
33237,"You guys hear a ringing?
"
33238,"- What the hell is this?
"
33239,"- Hey! Handcuffs! And fur line, nice!
"
33240,"I didn't know you guys had it in ya!
"
33241,"Chandler, you don't have a sister so you can't
"
33242,"understand how much this bums me out.
"
33243,"I didn't know Monica had these!
"
33244,"Mhm, maybe she used 'em with another boyfriend.
"
33245,"Maybe Richard!
"
33246,"Why would she use them with Richard and not me?
"
33247,"I can be kinky!
"
33248,"I once did a naked danced for her... with scarves!
"
33249,"Bumming hard, guys, bumming hard.
"
33250,"- Hey!
"
33251,"- Hey!
"
33252,"Where is Mike?
"
33253,"Oh, he has a gig.
"
33254,"I kinda like being married to a rock star, you know.
"
33255,"My husband has a gig.
"
33256,"Yeah? Where... where is it?
"
33257,"Oh, he's playing organ for a children's roller-skating party.
"
33258,"Rock on!
"
33259,"Wow, this is quite a spread!
"
33260,"What is all this stuff?
"
33261,"Well, I thought this would be a great opportunity
"
33262,"to use up all the food ...
"
33263,"...that I don't want to move
"
33264,"to the new house with me!
"
33265,"So, enjoy:
"
33266,"... smoked oyster casserole with a breakfast cereal crust,
"
33267,"... kidney beans in their own juices,
"
33268,"and for dessert, a questionable orange.
"
33269,"- Hey.
"
33270,"- Hey.
"
33271,"- Hey, where's Rach?
"
33272,"Oh, she's putting Emma down, she'll be over in a second.
"
33273,"Now it just  hit her that she's leaving and she's kind of emotional
"
33274,"... so no one say anything to set her off, okay?/Yeah.
"
33275,"- Hey, Rach, hey you.
"
33276,"- Here she is!
"
33277,"HIi you guys!
"
33278,"What did I just say?
"
33279,"No, no, no, it's okay, it's okay. I'm gonna be fine.
"
33280,"Come here, I'll make you a drink.
"
33281,"Oh, man! I can't believe she's actually leaving.
"
33282,"How am I gonna say goodbye to Rachel?
"
33283,"I know, she's been such a big part of my life,
"
33284,"and it feels like when ""Melrose Place"" got cancelled.
"
33285,"I mean...Oh, forget about it. I miss ""Melrose Place""!
"
33286,"- You know, I had a chance to stop her too!
"
33287,"- Yeah? Who loses 57 coin tosses in a row?
"
33288,"You know, heads she wins, tails I lose!
"
33289,"Wait a minute...
"
33290,"Yes, Joe?
"
33291,"I forgot to pick up my dry cleaning.
"
33292,"You doing okay?
"
33293,"- Well, I've been better.
"
33294,"- Uh-hmm.
"
33295,"You guys are gonna come and visit me, right?
"
33296,"Yes! You know,
"
33297,"in 6 months the Statue of Limitations runs out
"
33298,"... and I can travel internationally again!
"
33299,"- I'm gonna miss you so much!
"
33300,"- I know.
"
33301,"You know what?
"
33302,"Uhm, I have some goodbye stuff
"
33303,"that I wanted to say to each of you
"
33304,"... and I was gonna save it until the end of the night, but come here.
"
33305,"Come here.
"
33306,"Hey, what do you think they're doing in there?
"
33307,"Huh, if I had to guess I'd say Rachel's putting on the bubble wrap and
"
33308,"Phoebe's doing the punching.
"
33309,"Oh, Pheebs, I don't even know where to start.
"
33310,"Okay well, before you do, I know we weren't supposed
"
33311,"to get your ""going away"" presents,
"
33312,"but I do have something for you.
"
33313,"Oh, oh. What is it?
"
33314,"Well, it's cotton swab with a bit of my saliva on it,
"
33315,"... so that if they perfect the cloning process while you're over there,
"
33316,"you can use the DNA to create your own Pheebs!
"
33317,"I... I'm gonna throw this away,
"
33318,"... but thank you so much for the gesture!
"
33319,"Chandler?
"
33320,"I was just in our bedroom
"
33321,"and I found these on my pillow.
"
33322,"Oh, yes. I decided to leave these out for you
"
33323,"... in case Richard stops by and you wanna
"
33324,"engage a little light bondage and mustache play!
"
33325,"What are you talking about?
"
33326,"These aren't mine.
"
33327,"Oh yeah, right!
"
33328,"Good luck getting another scarf dance from me!
"
33329,"That would be a terrible punishment.
"
33330,"- But I'm serious, I've never seen these before.
"
33331,"- Really?
"
33332,"Then what are they doing in our guest room?
"
33333,"Rachel used to live in that room.
"
33334,"Rachel... with handcuffs! Interesting!
"
33335,"Joey's bare ass!
"
33336,"Well Played.
"
33337,"- I love you Phoebe.
"
33338,"- I love you too.
"
33339,"Please, please don't... don't turn into... you know, French bitch!
"
33340,"- Alright. Well, if I gonna do this, I'd better keep going.
"
33341,"- Okay.
"
33342,"- Okay. Monica?
"
33343,"- Yeah?
"
33344,"- Can you come here with me for a minute?
"
33345,"- Sure.
"
33346,"- Are you wearing waterproof mascara?
"
33347,"- No.
"
33348,"No, you're so screwed.
"
33349,"Hey, what's that all about?
"
33350,"She's gonna say goodbye to each of us individually.
"
33351,"Are you kidding? Oh my God...
"
33352,"Yeah, I know, it's gonna be even worse for you... God...
"
33353,"Ross, get ready to do some serious crying.
"
33354,"Oh, man, I'm not gonna be able to handle this.
"
33355,"Now I know how my students feel at the end of each year.
"
33356,"And why they act out by giving me such bad evaluations.
"
33357,"Mon... Okay... I've gotta... just say what it is I'm gonna say...
"
33358,"None of the amazing things that happened to me in the last ten years,would've happened if it wasn't for you.
"
33359,"No one's been more like a sister to me.
"
33360,"I know what you mean.
"
33361,"You are like a sister to me too.
"
33362,"I wouldn't know what I'm gonna do without you...
"
33363,"- You're the best friend I ever had.
"
33364,"- (Says something that cannot be understood)
"
33365,"What?
"
33366,"I... I... I... (again says something that cannot be understood)
"
33367,"That is so sweet!
"
33368,"Oh no, she took down Monica...
"
33369,"And I'm the cryer in the family.
"
33370,"Oh God! I could be next.
"
33371,"- Maybe she won't talk to me if it
"
33372,"looks like we're deep in conversation.
"
33373,"- Okay.
"
33374,"Oh, so that thing you said about the thing. It really
"
33375,"made me think about that other thing.
"
33376,"- Uh, Rach?
"
33377,"- Yah?
"
33378,"Well it's okay. Chandler's talking to her.
"
33379,"I really made you think about that thing uh?
"
33380,"Uh, Rach...
"
33381,"I think I have something that belongs to you.
"
33382,"Oh, I'm sure gonna miss pretending to laugh at your weird jokes that I don't get.
"
33383,"No, no, no... They are really yours.
"
33384,"We... found them in your old room.
"
33385,"Well, these aren't mine.
"
33386,"Maybe Monica used to use them with...
"
33387,"Don't say Richard!
"
33388,"Well, if they are not Monica's and not yours,
"
33389,"... then whose are they?
"
33390,"Well, I think you're forgetting the kinkiest former
"
33391,"resident of that room.
"
33392,"Pheebs!
"
33393,"Yeah!
"
33394,"I think these are yours.
"
33395,"These are not mine... Look how flimsy they are, come on!
"
33396,"Good God! You try to hang a guy from a water pipe with these,they'll snap like a piece of licorice.
"
33397,"- Can I taIk to you alone for a minute?
"
33398,"- Sure.
"
33399,"You don't really handcuff guys to water pipes, do you?
"
33400,"Where do you think Mike really is?
"
33401,"- Oh honey...
"
33402,"- Let me just say something... Because once we get into this,
"
33403,"I'm gonna get all uncomfortable and probably make some
"
33404,"stupid joke...
"
33405,"I just want to say that I...I love you.
"
33406,"And, I'm gonna miss you.
"
33407,"And I'm so sad that you're leaving.
"
33408,"Oh, you know what?
"
33409,"Let's not say anything else.
"
33410,"I love you.
"
33411,"Ooh, not so tight...
"
33412,"- I'm sorry, just give me one more chance.
"
33413,"- Okay. Oh...
"
33414,"I'm sor... Just go. Just go. I can't, I can't.
"
33415,"So, I guess you are next.
"
33416,"You are ready?
"
33417,"- I don't think so.
"
33418,"- Oh, you're definitely not.
"
33419,"I haven't cried like that in years.
"
33420,"You cried yesterday at the 6 o'clock news.
"
33421,"That old woman was being scammed by her mechanic.
"
33422,"God! I can't believe she saved me for last.
"
33423,"Why are they taking so long?
"
33424,"- I dunno. But, God, Joey seems to be handling it surprisingly well.
"
33425,"- No, no, no, no!
"
33426,"Okay, here we go...
"
33427,"Oh... Well...
"
33428,"Yeah...
"
33429,"I think I'm gonna to take off.
"
33430,"- Huh?
"
33431,"- Oh, you guys. This was an amazing night. Thank you so much.I love you. Good night.
"
33432,"What?
"
33433,"I don't get a goodbye?!
"
33434,"Lucky bustard!
"
33435,"Unbelievable!
"
33436,"She says goodbye to everyone but me!
"
33437,"Well,
"
33438,"maybe she thought that with all of your history it could be,
"
33439,"you know, implicit.
"
33440,"Well, it needs to be plicit.
"
33441,"Alright, let's think about this.
"
33442,"I mean, there's got to be an explanation.
"
33443,"Uh... did you do anything to make her mad?
"
33444,"No, I don't think so.
"
33445,"You know, maybe she was just really spent from our talk.
"
33446,"It's pretty intense.
"
33447,"- Yeah. Mine too.
"
33448,"- Mine was a humdinger.
"
33449,"Okay!
"
33450,"I mean don't I deserve anything?
"
33451,"I mean, a few tears, a cursory hug?
"
33452,"NOT FROM YOU!
"
33453,"Ross, if you're this upset, you should go and talk to her.
"
33454,"And say what? ""You owe me a goodbye"", I mean, he's got more pride than that.
"
33455,"THE HELL I DO!
"
33456,"I don't get a goodbye?
"
33457,"What?
"
33458,"Everyone gets a goodbye but me?
"
33459,"What have I got to do to get a goodbye, huh?
"
33460,"Be best firiends with you?
"
33461,"Uh, go out with you?
"
33462,"H..have a baby with you?
"
33463,"Oh wait a minute, wait a minute, I did all those things!
"
33464,"Ross...
"
33465,"Oh no, maybe it's me, I'm just not giving you enough credit.
"
33466,"Uh, I mean it is difficult to say goodbye to 5 people.
"
33467,"Uh, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, good... (makes choking noises)
"
33468,"It's physically impossible!
"
33469,"You know what? After all we've been through, I can't believe
"
33470,"this is how you want to leave things between us.
"
33471,"Have a, have a good time in Paris.
"
33472,"I hope Ross isn't too upset.
"
33473,"- I'm sure he's not more bummed out than I am.
"
33474,"- Tell me about it.
"
33475,"Well, you can't say we don't know how to throw a party.
"
33476,"Alright, I think I'm gonna head out.
"
33477,"Uh, where do you think you're going?
"
33478,"I thought I was going home to go to bed, but I'm sensing
"
33479,"there's something less fun for me to do here?
"
33480,"We are moving in a couple of days
"
33481,"and we've got a lot of packing to do.
"
33482,"It'd be great if you guys could pitch in.
"
33483,"Joey and I can finish up in the guest room.
"
33484,"Oh, yeah, yeah, good idea.
"
33485,"Oh no! You and Phoebe are gonna help me in here.
"
33486,"You couldn't be cool.
"
33487,"Okay, We're gonna start in the kitchen.
"
33488,"Plates get put into plate protectors
"
33489,"and stacked ten to a box.
"
33490,"The silverware gets bundled in rubber bands and then bubble wrapped.
"
33491,"- Got it?
"
33492,"- Yeah.
"
33493,"Good. Now I need you to be careful and efficient.
"
33494,"And remember, if I'm harsh with you, it is only
"
33495,"because you're doing it wrong.
"
33496,"Hey Mon, I think I've figured out whose handcuffs they are.
"
33497,"You did? How?
"
33498,"Well, I was cleaning out the closet and
"
33499,"I found some pictures of them... being used.
"
33500,"Oh my God! Let me see.
"
33501,"Who's that dirty old lady?
"
33502,"Monica's grandmother.
"
33503,"Nana liked it rough!
"
33504,"Hi.
"
33505,"- Hey!
"
33506,"- Come on here, have a seat.
"
33507,"How was your night?
"
33508,"Oh, it was okay. I went to a movie with my cousin and
"
33509,"then out for dinner.
"
33510,"We went to this place that had...
"
33511,"Ooh...Hoo... ooh... Anyway, they had these
"
33512,"really amazing cheeseburgers.
"
33513,"Erica, are you okay?
"
33514,"Yeah, you know, maybe I ate too much.
"
33515,"I keep getting these stomach aches.
"
33516,"They come and go like every few minutes.
"
33517,"- Oh my God!
"
33518,"- Relax! We'll just get her some antacids.
"
33519,"She doesn't have a stomache ache.
"
33520,"She's in labor!
"
33521,"- Oh my God!
"
33522,"- Yeah, you got to get to the hospital.
"
33523,"Okay! Chandler, get the coats.
"
33524,"Erica let's go.
"
33525,"Phoebe and Joey, keep packing!
"
33526,"Oh my God we're gonna have a baby.
"
33527,"Alright. We're gonna have a baby!
"
33528,"Oh God, oh God,
"
33529,"I got to sit down, I got to sit down.
"
33530,"- Honey, it's gonna be okay.
"
33531,"- You can do this. Just breathe.
"
33532,"Okay, okay... Okay, I feel a little better.
"
33533,"- Ooh! Are you sure?
"
33534,"- Oh... Yes, I'm sure.
"
33535,"- Oh honey, let's go.
"
33536,"- Okay bye everyone.
"
33537,"- Chandler, wait, wait, wait...
"
33538,"- What?
"
33539,"If you get a second, find out
"
33540,"where she got that cheeseburger.
"
33541,"You really think I didn't say goodbye to you
"
33542,"because I don't care?
"
33543,"That's what it seemed like.
"
33544,"I cannot believe that after 10 years,
"
33545,"you do not know ONE thing about me.
"
33546,"Fine, then why didn't you say something?
"
33547,"Because it is too damn hard, Ross!
"
33548,"I can't even begin to explain to you
"
33549,"how much I'm gonna miss you.
"
33550,"When I think about not seeing you everyday,
"
33551,"it makes me not want to go...
"
33552,"Okay, so if you think that I didn't say goodbye to you
"
33553,"because you don't mean as much to me as everybody else,
"
33554,"... you're wrong.
"
33555,"It's because you mean more to me.
"
33556,"So there, alright, there's your goodbye... Oh!
"
33557,"- Rach!
"
33558,"- What?
"
33559,"- You keep, you keep... You can't...
"
33560,"- What?
"
33561,"- A little more.
"
33562,"- Okay.
"
33563,"A little more, a little more.
"
33564,"Alright. Okay, let's do this.
"
33565,"- Alright, ready?
"
33566,"- Yeah. Alright, now give me your best shot.
"
33567,"Alright, here it goes...
"
33568,"Doesn't work...
"
33569,"<font color=""#ffff00"" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net
"
33570,"Monica's gonna freak if every
"
33571,"box isn't labeled.
"
33572,"You're right, okay...
"
33573,"box.. of...
"
33574,"crap...
"
33575,"When Monica and Chandler come
"
33576,"back here,
"
33577,"they're gonna have a baby !
"
33578,"- a baby !
"
33579,"- I know !
"
33580,"Ross doesn't know the baby is coming.
"
33581,"Should we call and tell him?
"
33582,"Rachel still over there yelling at him.
"
33583,"Poor guy, I would not wanna be him right now...
"
33584,"- Wait. Should we be doing this ?
"
33585,"- I don't know.
"
33586,"- It's quite not really a good idea.
"
33587,"- Probably not.
"
33588,"- I've never stopped this before.
"
33589,"- No, sir.
"
33590,"The Last One
"
33591,"I cant believe in a couple
"
33592,"of hours we're gonna be parents.
"
33593,"I can't believe it's three weeks early.
"
33594,"I love that our baby is prompt!
"
33595,"What room did the nurse say Erica was in?
"
33596,"702.
"
33597,"Come on, Michelle.
"
33598,"Get this thing out of me!
"
33599,"Well, These are for you!
"
33600,"Did you see the size of the thing that was
"
33601,"coming out of that woman?
"
33602,"I couldn't tell who is giving birth to who!
"
33603,"- How is it going ?
"
33604,"- It's Ok.
"
33605,"The doctor says it'll still be a while.
"
33606,"- How do you feel?
"
33607,"- Well, It hurts sometimes.
"
33608,"Not too bad at yet, though.
"
33609,"It's a little scary.
"
33610,"I know, but you're gonna be fine.
"
33611,"Tell that to the lady in 702
"
33612,"With the toddler coming out of her.
"
33613,"I think that kid was wearing a shirt!
"
33614,"You're gonna be fine, though.
"
33615,"- Go back to sleep.
"
33616,"I have to go home.
"
33617,"- Oh, God. This was amazing.
"
33618,"- It really was.
"
33619,"You've learned some new moves!
"
33620,"- Yeah, well, this guy at
"
33621,"work gave me ""Sex for Dummies"" as a joke.
"
33622,"- Who's laughing now?
"
33623,"- I know!
"
33624,"- Breathe, breathe, breathe...
"
33625,"- Good...
"
33626,"- Next time, can I say breathe?
"
33627,"- No, last time you said it
"
33628,"like Dracula,and it scared her!
"
33629,"Can I get you anything?
"
33630,"You want some more ice chips?
"
33631,"- No, I'm okay.
"
33632,"- Alright, I'll be right back.
"
33633,"- Where are you going?
"
33634,"- To use the bathroom.
"
33635,"- You can't leave me alone with her.
"
33636,"- What?
"
33637,"- This is exactly the kind of social situation
"
33638,"that I am not comfortable with!
"
33639,"- What kind of social situation
"
33640,"are you comfortable with?
"
33641,"- It's just that we've never spent any time,
"
33642,"you know, alone together.
"
33643,"- You'll be fine.
"
33644,"Nah, you won't, but I'll be back in two minutes.
"
33645,"- So,...
"
33646,"Any plans for the summer?
"
33647,"- I don't know. Maybe church-camp?
"
33648,"- Hah. May not wanna mention this.
"
33649,"So, you ever wonder which is worse, you know;
"
33650,"going through labor
"
33651,"or getting kicked in the nuts?
"
33652,"- What?
"
33653,"- Well, it's just interesting.
"
33654,"You know, because no one will ever know,
"
33655,"because no one can experience both.
"
33656,"- One of life's great, unanswerable questions.
"
33657,"I mean, who knows? Maybe there's something
"
33658,"even more painful than those things?
"
33659,"Like this..
"
33660,"- Come in.
"
33661,"- Morning.
"
33662,"What's that?
"
33663,"- It's my house-warming present
"
33664,"for Monica and Chandler.
"
33665,"- It's a baby chick and duck!
"
33666,"- Uh-huh. And I named them Chick Jr. and Duck Jr.
"
33667,"- I did not see that coming.
"
33668,"- Yeah, I figure they'll love it at the new house
"
33669,"you know? It has that big backyard.
"
33670,"And then, when they get old,
"
33671,"they can go to that special farm
"
33672,"that Chandler took the other chick and duck to.
"
33673,"Yes!
"
33674,"- Yeah. It's a shame people can't visit there.
"
33675,"- That is the rule, though.
"
33676,"- Guess what? You're almost an uncle!
"
33677,"What?
"
33678,"- Yeah, Erica went into labor last night.
"
33679,"Monica and Chandler are at the hospital right now!
"
33680,"- Oh my God!
"
33681,"- Yeah, and I have a definite
"
33682,"feeling it's gonna be a girl.
"
33683,"- Phoebe, you were sure Ben was gonna be a girl.
"
33684,"- Have you seen him throw a ball?
"
33685,"- Is Rachel here?
"
33686,"- Uh, I think she's still asleep.
"
33687,"Hey, how did it go with you guys last night?
"
33688,"She seemed pretty pissed at you.
"
33689,"we worked things out.
"
33690,"- What's that smile?
"
33691,"Did something happen with you two?
"
33692,"-  Hey, I'm not one to kiss and tell...
"
33693,"but I'm also not one to have sex
"
33694,"and shut up. We totally did it!
"
33695,"- Oh my God. You and Rachel?
"
33696,"- I know, it's pretty great.
"
33697,"- So what does that mean? Are you guys
"
33698,"getting back together?
"
33699,"- Oh, I.. I don't know.
"
33700,"We didn't really get to talk.
"
33701,"- But do you wanna get back together?
"
33702,"- I don't know.
"
33703,"It was incredible.
"
33704,"I mean, it just felt so right.
"
33705,"When I was holding her, I mean...
"
33706,"I never wanted to let her go.
"
33707,"You know what? Yeah, I do. I wanna be together.
"
33708,"Yay!
"
33709,"Yay!
"
33710,"- So, so is she still going to Paris?
"
33711,"- Wow, I hadn't thought of that.
"
33712,"I hope not.
"
33713,"- Oh, this is like the best day ever. Ever!
"
33714,"You guys might get back together,
"
33715,"Monica and Chandler are getting their baby,
"
33716,"there are chicks and ducks in the world again!
"
33717,"Oh, I feel like I'm in a musical!
"
33718,"""Daa - raa... When the sun comes up,
"
33719,"bright and beaming! And the moon comes...""
"
33720,"- Morning!
"
33721,"- Guess we'll never know how it ends.
"
33722,"- Hey. How did you sleep?
"
33723,"- Good. You?
"
33724,"- Good.
"
33725,"- I bet you did!
"
33726,"- Uh. Would you guys mind giving us a minute?
"
33727,"- Sure, yeah. Will you just keep an eye
"
33728,"on the chick and the duck?
"
33729,"- Chick and the duck? Didn't they die...
"
33730,"- Dive!
"
33731,"Yeah, they dove head-first
"
33732,"into fun on the farm.
"
33733,"Morning.
"
33734,"- You too.
"
33735,"Last night was just wonderful.
"
33736,"- It really was.
"
33737,"- I woke up today with the biggest
"
33738,"smile on my face.
"
33739,"- I know, me too.
"
33740,"You know, it was like one of those things
"
33741,"you think is never gonna happen,
"
33742,"and then it does,
"
33743,"and it's everything you want it to be.
"
33744,"- Uh-huh. I know. It was just,
"
33745,"it was just the perfect way to say goodbye.
"
33746,"- It's just a little bit more, honey.
"
33747,"- Help me! This hurts!
"
33748,"- Is it really that bad?
"
33749,"I think it's time to kick you
"
33750,"in the nuts and see which is worse!
"
33751,"The baby's head is crowning.
"
33752,"- Oh! Oh my God!
"
33753,"That is the most beautiful
"
33754,"top of a head I have ever seen!
"
33755,"Chandler, you have to see this!
"
33756,"- I'm okay.
"
33757,"- Chandler, you don't wanna miss this...
"
33758,"This is the birth of your child!
"
33759,"It's the miracle of life!
"
33760,"- Alright.
"
33761,"Wow, that is one disgusting miracle.
"
33762,"Start pushing. Here we go.
"
33763,"Here come the shoulders...
"
33764,"- It's a... It's a boy!
"
33765,"- Is he okay?
"
33766,"- He's just fine.
"
33767,"- Oh, you did it!
"
33768,"- It's a baby!
"
33769,"A beautiful little baby!...
"
33770,"And some other stuff I'm gonna
"
33771,"pretend I don't see.
"
33772,"Would you like to cut the umbilical cord?
"
33773,"- Well, that's spongy.
"
33774,"- Oh, hey handsome!
"
33775,"Oh, I'm gonna love you so much that...
"
33776,"no woman is ever gonna be good enough for you!
"
33777,"- Oh, we are so lucky!
"
33778,"- I know.
"
33779,"He has your eyes.
"
33780,"- I mean, I know that's
"
33781,"not possible, but he does.
"
33782,"We'll just get him cleaned up a bit.
"
33783,"- Oh my God, he's beautiful.
"
33784,"Thank you so much.
"
33785,"- I'm really happy for you guys.
"
33786,"- How do you feel?
"
33787,"- I'm tired!
"
33788,"Well, you don't have that much time to relax.
"
33789,"The other one will be along in a minute.
"
33790,"I'm sorry, who should be along in a what now?
"
33791,"The next baby should be along in a minute.
"
33792,"- We only ordered one!
"
33793,"- You know it's twins, right?
"
33794,"- Oh, yeah!
"
33795,"These are the faces
"
33796,"of two people in the know!
"
33797,"I can't believe you didn't know it's twins!
"
33798,"This has never happened before.
"
33799,"- Well, gosh. That makes me
"
33800,"feel so special and good.
"
33801,"Wait, did you know it was twins?
"
33802,"Yeah, it's here in the paperwork
"
33803,"we got from the clinic in Ohio.
"
33804,"- Anybody tell you?
"
33805,"- I don't think so.
"
33806,"Although, they did mention
"
33807,"something about two heartbeats.
"
33808,"But I thought that was just mine and the baby's.
"
33809,"They kept saying both heartbeats
"
33810,"are really strong...
"
33811,"and I thought well, that's
"
33812,"good 'cause I'm having a baby.
"
33813,"- This is unbelievable.
"
33814,"- Twins actually run in my family.
"
33815,"- Interesting!
"
33816,"Can I see you for a second?
"
33817,"- What do we do?
"
33818,"- What do you mean ""what do we do""?
"
33819,"Twins!!
"
33820,"Twins!!
"
33821,"- Chandler, you're panicking!
"
33822,"- Ah-ha...
"
33823,"Join me, won't you?!
"
33824,"Okay, what do you say we keep one,
"
33825,"and then just like have
"
33826,"an option on the other one?
"
33827,"- We can't split them up!
"
33828,"- Why not? 
"
33829,"We could give each of them half a 
"
33830,"medallion,
"
33831,"and then years later,
"
33832,"they'll find each other
"
33833,"and be reunited
"
33834,"I mean, that's a great day for everybody.
"
33835,"- Okay, what if the person who adopts
"
33836,"the other one is horrible?
"
33837,"- What if they're not?
"
33838,"What if it's adopted by a king?
"
33839,"- Yeah, because I hear the king
"
33840,"is looking to adopt.
"
33841,"- Monica, we are not ready to have two babies!
"
33842,"- That doesn't matter! 
"
33843,"We have waited so long for this.
"
33844,"I don't care if it's two babies. 
"
33845,"I don't care if it's three babies! 
"
33846,"I don't care if the entire cast of 
"
33847,"""Eight is Enough"" comes out of there!
"
33848,"We are taking them home,
"
33849,"because they are our children!
"
33850,"It looks like we're about ready over here.
"
33851,"Come on, Erica, start pushing again now.
"
33852,"Here she comes!
"
33853,"- She? It's a girl?
"
33854,"- Yeah.
"
33855,"- Well, now we have one of each!
"
33856,"And that's enough!
"
33857,"- And then she said it was
"
33858,"the perfect way to say goodbye.
"
33859,"- Oh my God!
"
33860,"- What did you say?
"
33861,"- Nothing! What do you say to that?
"
33862,"- Ross, you've got to tell her how you feel!
"
33863,"- No way!
"
33864,"- You can't just give up!
"
33865,"Is that what a dinosaur would do?
"
33866,"- What?
"
33867,"- Dude, I'm just trying to speak your language.
"
33868,"- Ross, Rachel doesn't know that
"
33869,"you wanna get back together...
"
33870,"...If she did, she might feel differently.
"
33871,"She might not even go.
"
33872,"- You really think so?
"
33873,"- I'm telling you!
"
33874,"Oh, okay! This is the part of the musical
"
33875,"where there'd be a really good convincing song.
"
33876,"Don't take no for an answer.
"
33877,"- Don't let love fly away.
"
33878,"- Hi!
"
33879,"- Can't a girl finish a song around here?
"
33880,"- Hi! So I just dropped Emma off at my mom's.
"
33881,"- Oh, you're not taking her with you tonight?
"
33882,"- No, we decided that
"
33883,"I would go ahead and set up first,
"
33884,"and then my mom would bring
"
33885,"Emma to Paris on Sunday.
"
33886,"- Wow, eight hour flight with
"
33887,"a one-year old? Good luck, mom.
"
33888,"- Are you kidding?
"
33889,"Eight hours with my mother talking about Atkins?
"
33890,"Good luck, Emma!
"
33891,"- Alright, you know what? You're right.
"
33892,"I should at least tell her how I feel.
"
33893,"- Ross, wait, wait!
"
33894,"- What? What?
"
33895,"- Could you get me a muffin?
"
33896,"- Rachel ?
"
33897,"- Yeah?
"
33898,"I know you're leaving tonight,
"
33899,"...but I just have to tell you...
"
33900,"...I love you.
"
33901,"I don't know if that
"
33902,"changes your plans at all, but..
"
33903,"...I thought you should know.
"
33904,"Gunther...
"
33905,"I love you too. 
"
33906,"Probably not in the same way,...
"
33907,"...but I do. And,
"
33908,"and when I'm in a cafï¿½, having coffee,
"
33909,"or I see a man with hair
"
33910,"brighter than the sun,
"
33911,"I'll think of you.
"
33912,"- Oh... Bye guys.
"
33913,"- Bye.
"
33914,"- Oh my God!
"
33915,"- Unbelievable!
"
33916,"- Hey, you know what might help?
"
33917,"- I'm not getting you a muffin!
"
33918,"- Do you think they recognize
"
33919,"each other from in there?
"
33920,"- Maybe.
"
33921,"Unless they're like two people
"
33922,"who have lived in apartments
"
33923,"next to each other for years,
"
33924,"and then one day, they're pushed
"
33925,"through a vagina and they meet.
"
33926,"We're going to take Erica to recovery now.
"
33927,"- There's something that we wanna tell you.
"
33928,"We decided to name the girl-baby Erica.
"
33929,"- Oh my God, that's just like my name!
"
33930,"- Son of a gun, it is!
"
33931,"- Anyway, I'm gonna go and get some rest.
"
33932,"I'm really glad I picked you guys.
"
33933,"You're gonna make great parents.
"
33934,"Even Chandler.
"
33935,"- Okay, well, bye!
"
33936,"- Bye!
"
33937,"- We'll call you!
"
33938,"- Have fun at church-camp!
"
33939,"- Oh, look at these little bunnies!
"
33940,"- I know!
"
33941,"You ready to trade?
"
33942,"- We could trade later.
"
33943,"- Yeah, I'm good.
"
33944,"- Hey, what are you working on?
"
33945,"- It's a ""welcome home"" sign for the baby.
"
33946,"- How sweet! Oh, is that the baby?
"
33947,"- No, I sat in the paint.
"
33948,"- Hey. So, did you talk to Rachel?
"
33949,"- No, and I'm not going to.
"
33950,"- What?
"
33951,"- Why not?
"
33952,"- Because she's just going to shoot me down.
"
33953,"You guys saw what happened with Gunther.
"
33954,"That did not look like fun.
"
33955,"- How can you compare yourself to Gunther?
"
33956,"I mean, sure, he's sexy in a more obvious way.
"
33957,"You have a relationship with her,
"
33958,"- you slept together last night!
"
33959,"- Yeah, and she still wants to go!
"
33960,"It's pretty clear where she is.
"
33961,"- Yeah, I know what you mean. I mean, sometimes...
"
33962,"- Uh, Joe?
"
33963,"- Damn it!
"
33964,"- Look, even if I were gonna tell her,
"
33965,"I don't have to do it now.
"
33966,"Okay? I'll be seeing her again.
"
33967,"We've got time.
"
33968,"-  No, you don't!
"
33969,"She's going to Paris!
"
33970,"She is going to meet somebody.
"
33971,"Do you know how many hot guys there are in Paris?
"
33972,"It's... It's a city of Gunthers!
"
33973,"- Hey! What do you have there?
"
33974,"Oh, I made a little something.
"
33975,"If I had more time to work on it,
"
33976,"it'd be better, but..
"
33977,"- Oh my God! You did that yourself?
"
33978,"- Honey, that's gorgeous!.
"
33979,"- You know, the baby can't read, Mike!
"
33980,"- Hi! You guys, the car-service just got here.
"
33981,"I can't believe they're not home yet!
"
33982,"I have to catch my stupid plane.
"
33983,"I wanna see the baby!
"
33984,"- Monica just called from the cab.
"
33985,"She said they should be here any minute.
"
33986,"And apparently, there's some big surprise.
"
33987,"- Yeah, did she sound happy about it?
"
33988,"'Cause my friend Ethel's baby...
"
33989,"was born with a teeny, tiny beard.
"
33990,"Hey, so what is the big surprise?
"
33991,"- Oh my God!
"
33992,"- Okay, okay, awkward question :
"
33993,"The hospital knows you took two, right?
"
33994,"- Yes, it's twins!
"
33995,"- Oh, they're so cute!
"
33996,"Now, what, what kinds are they?
"
33997,"This is a boy,
"
33998,"and that's a girl.
"
33999,"- Her name is Erica.
"
34000,"- Hey, that pregnant girl's name was Erica!
"
34001,"- Yeah. It's a shame you
"
34002,"two didn't get to spend more time together.
"
34003,"- Yeah, we named the boy Jack after dad.
"
34004,"- Aw, he's gonna be so happy.
"
34005,"- Oh, Jack Bing. I love that.
"
34006,"it sounds like a '40s newspaper guy, you know?
"
34007,"Jack Bing, Morning Gazette :
"
34008,"""I'm gonna blow this story wide open!""
"
34009,"Wow, so beautiful.
"
34010,"I want one.
"
34011,"- Oh yeah?
"
34012,"Well, tell me which one,
"
34013,"and I'll try slip it in my coat.
"
34014,"Seriously.
"
34015,"Wanna make one of those?
"
34016,"- One? How about a whole bunch?
"
34017,"- Really?
"
34018,"- Yeah!
"
34019,"- Ooh, we could teach them to sing,
"
34020,"....and we can be like the Von Trapp family!
"
34021,"Only without the Nazis.
"
34022,"Although that sounds kinda dull.
"
34023,"- Oh, you guys, I can't believe this...
"
34024,"... But I'll leave now,
"
34025,"or I'm gonna miss my plane.
"
34026,"- I'm just so glad you got to see the babies.
"
34027,"- Me too.
"
34028,"Oh, I'm just sorry I'm not gonna be around
"
34029,"to watch you two attempt to handle this!
"
34030,"Alright,
"
34031,"I can't say goodbye to you guys again...
"
34032,"... I love you all so much.
"
34033,"- I love you.
"
34034,"- Call us when you get there!
"
34035,"-  I will.
"
34036,"Ross, come here.
"
34037,"- I just want you to know..
"
34038,"... Last night.. 
"
34039,"...I'll never forget it.
"
34040,"- Neither will I.
"
34041,"- Alright, now I really have to go.
"
34042,"Ok. "" Au revoir ! "".
"
34043,"they're gonna really hate me over there.
"
34044,"- So, you just let her go?
"
34045,"- Yeah.
"
34046,"- Hey, maybe that's for the best.
"
34047,"- Yeah?
"
34048,"- Yeah. You know?
"
34049,"You gotta think about last night
"
34050,"the way she does, okay?
"
34051,"Maybe...
"
34052,"maybe sleeping together was..
"
34053,"the perfect way to say goodbye.
"
34054,"They slept together?
"
34055,"I was with you!
"
34056,"- But now she'll never know how he feels!
"
34057,"- Maybe that's okay. You know? 
"
34058,"...Maybe, maybe it is better this way...
"
34059,"I mean, now, now you can move on...
"
34060,"...I mean, you've been trying to for so long,
"
34061,"maybe now that you're on different continents.. 
"
34062,"Right?
"
34063,"- Maybe now you can actually do it.
"
34064,"You know? You can...
"
34065,"You can finally get over her.
"
34066,"- Yeah, that's true.
"
34067,".. Except 
"
34068,"...I don't wanna get over her.
"
34069,"- What?
"
34070,"- I don't! I wanna be with her.
"
34071,"- Really?
"
34072,"- Yeah, I'm gonna go after her.
"
34073,"Wait, wait! Get your coat!
"
34074,"- Get your coat!
"
34075,"- My coat....
"
34076,"- This is so cool!
"
34077,"- I have no idea what's going on,
"
34078,"but I am excited!
"
34079,"- But Ross, What do you, what do you think she's going to say?
"
34080,"- I don't know
"
34081,"- but I.. Look, even if she
"
34082,"shoots me down, at least...
"
34083,"I won't spend the rest of my life
"
34084,"wondering what would have happened.
"
34085,"- where is my coat?!
"
34086,"- You didn't bring one!
"
34087,"My cab's downstairs,
"
34088,"I'll drive you to the airport.
"
34089,"- Okay, guys, wish me luck.
"
34090,"- Hurry!
"
34091,"- Good luck, good luck!
"
34092,"Oh my God.
"
34093,"Ross is going after Rachel.
"
34094,"And you guys have babys.
"
34095,"This is like the best day ever.
"
34096,"Why there's an ass-shaped
"
34097,"paint stain on my couch?
"
34098,"Just your question, Mike !
"
34099,"You really think we gonna make it in time?
"
34100,"Hey, I haven't had my licence taken away
"
34101,"'cause I drive carefully?
"
34102,"- There's no seatbelt!
"
34103,"- That's okay. If we hit anything,...
"
34104,"the engine will explode, so you know, 
"
34105,"it's better if you're thrown from the car.
"
34106,"- Alright, alright, let's do this!
"
34107,"- Ok.
"
34108,"- 18th and East End.
"
34109,"- I don't take passengers.
"
34110,"- Hey! The law says you have to accept any fare.
"
34111,"- No, you don't understand.
"
34112,"This isn't a real cab.
"
34113,"Alright, I gotta report you.
"
34114,"What's your medallion number?
"
34115,"My medallion number is :
"
34116,"- Get out of the cab!
"
34117,"- What?
"
34118,"- Get out of the cab!
"
34119,"- Get out of the cab!
"
34120,"Hey, guys. Check this out!
"
34121,"- No!
"
34122,"- Ok.
"
34123,"- Oh, hey, can I give you guys
"
34124,"your house-warming present now?
"
34125,"- Now, that you can do.
"
34126,"I have a question.
"
34127,"Without looking under the diapers,
"
34128,"can you tell them apart?
"
34129,"Ofcourse I can, I'm their mother!
"
34130,"Ok, which one is that one?
"
34131,"That's Jack.
"
34132,"Jack's gonna have a tough
"
34133,"time in high schoole with that vagina!
"
34134,"Chick Jr.?
"
34135,"Duck Jr.?
"
34136,"Don't hide from mama!
"
34137,"- You can open your eyes now.
"
34138,"- Are we off the bridge?
"
34139,"- Yes.
"
34140,"- Is the old woman on the bicycle still alive?
"
34141,"- Yes, she jumped right back up.
"
34142,"- Oh my God, Phoebe, slow down!
"
34143,"- Do you wanna get to Rachel in time?
"
34144,"- Yes, but I don't wanna die in your cab!
"
34145,"- You should have thought of
"
34146,"that before you got in!
"
34147,"Toll-booth.
"
34148,"- What?
"
34149,"- Toll-booth!
"
34150,"Four bucks. There are quarters
"
34151,"in the glove compartment.
"
34152,"- Hurry!
"
34153,"- Damn, that window is clean.
"
34154,"- We were wondering 
"
34155,"what was taking so long with the gift,
"
34156,"but now we understand you were doing this!
"
34157,"- Okay, I wanted to surprise you, but
"
34158,"for your house-warming gift, 
"
34159,"I got you a baby-chick and a baby-duck!
"
34160,"- Really?
"
34161,"You got us a chick and a duck?
"
34162,"- Oh, great! Just what you 
"
34163,"want for a new house with infants.
"
34164,"Bird feces.
"
34165,"- Yeah, they must have jumped off the table,
"
34166,"'cause now they're gone!
"
34167,"- Oh, don't worry, we'll find them.
"
34168,"- Actually, I'm gonna go check on the twins.
"
34169,"- Oh God! What did I just step on?
"
34170,"- It's okay, it's just an egg roll.
"
34171,"- You stepped on my egg roll?
"
34172,"- I'm sorry, I didn't know to look
"
34173,"for Chinese food on the floor!
"
34174,"- Just put it on a plate and leave!
"
34175,"- Okay, let's find these birds.
"
34176,"- Okay.
"
34177,"- Wait, wait. Do you hear that?
"
34178,"- Oh! They're in the table!
"
34179,"- Well, that can't be good!
"
34180,"- We gotta get them out of there!
"
34181,"- How?
"
34182,"- Oh, oh! Maybe we can lure 
"
34183,"them out. You know any birdcalls?
"
34184,"- Oh, tons, I'm quite the woodsman.
"
34185,"- Well, maybe we can just tip the table a little.
"
34186,"- Joey, wait! The ball!
"
34187,"- Oh God!
"
34188,"- So what do we do?
"
34189,"- I don't know.
"
34190,"- Maybe we can open this up somehow.
"
34191,"- Okay.
"
34192,"- No... It's all glued together.
"
34193,"- Does that mean we have to bust it open?
"
34194,"- I don't know. Maybe.
"
34195,"- Oh my God!
"
34196,"- I know! It's..
"
34197,"It's the foosball table.
"
34198,"- All right, you know what? 
"
34199,"We don't have a choice.
"
34200,"It's like I would have said in 
"
34201,"that sci-fi movie,
"
34202,"if I'd gotten the part.
"
34203,"""Those are our men in there,
"
34204,"we have to get them out!
"
34205,"Even if I have to sacrifice the most 
"
34206,"important thing in my life...
"
34207,"... my time-machine.""
"
34208,"- Did that movie ever get made?
"
34209,"- It did not.
"
34210,"- Ross, where are you going?
"
34211,"- To talk to Rachel,
"
34212,"isn't that why we took a ride in the death-cab?
"
34213,"- What? are you just gonna walk up
"
34214,"to her at the gate?
"
34215,"Have you never chased anyone
"
34216,"through the airport before?
"
34217,"- Not since my cop-show got cancelled.
"
34218,"- You have to get a ticket to get past security.
"
34219,"- What? We're never gonna make it!
"
34220,"- Not with that attitude! Now, haul ass!
"
34221,"-  Okay, if you could all walk slower,
"
34222,"that'd be great.
"
34223,"Madame, your passport please?
"
34224,"- Oh my God! I was so afraid I wasn't gonna 
"
34225,"remember any of my high-school French,
"
34226,"but I understood every word you just said!
"
34227,"Your boarding pass, please.
"
34228,"- Oh, shoot. I had it. Oh, 
"
34229,"I can't believe this.
"
34230,"- Madame, if you don't have your boarding pass...
"
34231,"- I have it, I have it, I have it.
"
34232,"okay, I can't find it, but I remember
"
34233,"that I was in seat 32C,
"
34234,"because that's my bra-size.
"
34235,"- Madame, you must have your boarding pass..
"
34236,"- Okay, fine!
"
34237,"But you know what? If I was in 36D,
"
34238,"we would not be having this problem.
"
34239,"- Hey, I need a ticket.
"
34240,"- Just one?
"
34241,"I drive you all the way down here, 
"
34242,"and I don't get to see how it works out?
"
34243,"- Fine, two tickets, I need two tickets.
"
34244,"- We're on our honeymoon.
"
34245,"- And the destination?
"
34246,"- I don't care. Whatever is the cheapest.
"
34247,"- I'm so lucky I married you.
"
34248,"- Oh! Shoot! Damn it! Where is it?
"
34249,"Oh! Oh! I found it! I found it!
"
34250,"- Hah! I found it! 
"
34251,"I told you I would find it! In your face!.
"
34252,"You're a different person.
"
34253,"- Okay, flight 421 to Paris.
"
34254,"I don't see it, do you see it?
"
34255,"- No, did we miss it?
"
34256,"- No, That's impossible. It doesn't
"
34257,"leave for another 20 minutes.
"
34258,"- Maybe we have the flight-number wrong. God.
"
34259,"- Hello.
"
34260,"- Hey, it's me. Here's Ross.
"
34261,"- What? Hey, hey, listen..
"
34262,"- Oh my God! Ross, you wouldn't believe
"
34263,"the cute little noises the twins are making.
"
34264,"- Listen.
"
34265,"- Monica !
"
34266,"- Oh, I'm sorry. Shoot, they
"
34267,"were doing it before.
"
34268,"- That's alright. Listen, listen.
"
34269,"- Oh, wait! Here they go again.
"
34270,"- Isn't that cute?
"
34271,"- That is precious!
"
34272,"Listen! I need Rachel's flight information.
"
34273,"It's flight 421. Leaves at 8:40.
"
34274,"- Yes, that's what I have.
"
34275,"It's not on the board.
"
34276,"- That's what it says here.
"
34277,"Flight 421, leaves at 8:40, Newark airport.
"
34278,"- What?
"
34279,"- Newark airport.
"
34280,"Why, where are you?
"
34281,"- JFK.
"
34282,"Don't worry, you guys,
"
34283,"we're gonna get you out of there!
"
34284,"- And we're also gonna buy you
"
34285,"tiny, bird hearing-aids.
"
34286,"- Okay. Here goes!
"
34287,"- What's the matter?
"
34288,"- I need to say goodbye to the table first.
"
34289,"- I understand.
"
34290,"Table,
"
34291,"you have given us so many great times.
"
34292,"And you guys, Jordan, Victor, Joel... 
"
34293,"All of you guys, What can I say?
"
34294,"You guys...
"
34295,"...make us...
"
34296,"look good.
"
34297,"- You wanna say anything?
"
34298,"- I don't know.
"
34299,"Except that, for one last time...
"
34300,"Good game, good game, good game...
"
34301,"good game.
"
34302,"- Okay, here we go.
"
34303,"I can't do it.
"
34304,"- Well, I can't do it either.
"
34305,"- Hey! Did you find them?
"
34306,"- Yeah, they're stuck inside the table!
"
34307,"-  We have to bust it open,
"
34308,"but neither of us can do it!
"
34309,"- Oh, well sure. This gotta be so hard.
"
34310,"I'll do it. Gimme!
"
34311,"- Phoebe!
"
34312,"Wow! No, no, no!
"
34313,"-  Well, I've never gone this fast before!
"
34314,"-  Phoebe, forget it, okay?
"
34315,"Newark is like an hour away.
"
34316,"...There's no way we're gonna make it in time.
"
34317,"- She's got her cell, you could call her.
"
34318,"- I am not doing this over the phone.
"
34319,"- You don't have any other choice!
"
34320,"- Hello?
"
34321,"- Rachel? Oh, good.
"
34322,"- Hey, by the way, did you just get on the plane?
"
34323,"- Yeah.
"
34324,"For what it's worth, we would have caught
"
34325,"her if we were at the right airport.
"
34326,"- Uh, Rach, hang on.
"
34327,"- Phoebe? Is everything okay?
"
34328,"- Uhm, actually no. No, you've...
"
34329,"- You have to get off the plane.
"
34330,"- What? Why?
"
34331,"- I have this feeling that
"
34332,"something's wrong with it.
"
34333,"... Something is wrong with the left phalange.
"
34334,"- Oh, honey, I'm sure there's nothing
"
34335,"wrong with the plane.
"
34336,"- Alright, look, I have to go.
"
34337,"I love you, and I will call
"
34338,"you the minute I get to Paris..
"
34339,"Uhm, what was that?
"
34340,"- Oh, that was just my crazy friend. 
"
34341,"She told me I should get off the plane,
"
34342,"because she had a feeling that there
"
34343,"was something wrong with the left phalange.
"
34344,"Okay, that doesn't sound good.
"
34345,"- I wouldn't worry about it.,
"
34346,"She's always coming up with stuff like this,
"
34347,"and you know what? She's almost never right.
"
34348,"- But she is sometimes?
"
34349,"- Well...
"
34350,"- Wait, what are you doing?
"
34351,"- Well, I can't take this plane now.
"
34352,"Excuse me, sir?
"
34353,"- where are you going?
"
34354,"- I have to get off this plane, okay?
"
34355,"Her friend has a feeling..
"
34356,"...something's wrong with the left phalange.
"
34357,"- Could I get some peanuts?
"
34358,"- What's wrong with the plane?
"
34359,"- There's nothing wrong with the plane.
"
34360,"- Yeah! The left phalange!
"
34361,"- There is no phalange!
"
34362,"- Oh my God.
"
34363,"This plane doesn't even have a phalange!
"
34364,"- I'm not flying on it!
"
34365,"- Ma'am, please sit down!
"
34366,"- What's going on?
"
34367,"- We're all getting off.
"
34368,"There is no phalange!
"
34369,"- This is ridiculous! I...
"
34370,"- Yeah, okay.
"
34371,"- Alright. My job here is done.
"
34372,"- That was... Impressive.
"
34373,"- Yeah, you didn't even use the tools
"
34374,"for most of it!
"
34375,"- Yeah, they were just slowing me down.
"
34376,"Alright, I have to get back to the babies.
"
34377,"I'll see you girls later.
"
34378,"- Sorry about the table, man.
"
34379,"- You gonna buy a new one?
"
34380,"- Probably not.
"
34381,"...Nah. I don't know how much I'm gonna
"
34382,"wanna play after you go.
"
34383,"- Well, at least we got these little guys out.
"
34384,"- Aww, we were worried about you!
"
34385,"I guess I better get used to things
"
34386,"crapping in my hand, huh?
"
34387,"-  I'm gonna miss these little guys.
"
34388,"It was nice having birds around again.
"
34389,"- Hey, you know what?
"
34390,"Maybe we should keep them here with you.
"
34391,"- What?
"
34392,"- Yeah, I mean we've got a lot going on right now.
"
34393,"And, plus, here they'd have their own room.
"
34394,"- I could get a goose!
"
34395,"You know, I think you're set with the poultry.
"
34396,"- Thanks man.
"
34397,"Did you hear that, you guys?
"
34398,"You're gonna get to stay here!
"
34399,"And, and it's good, you know, 'cause,
"
34400,"'cause now you have a reason to come visit.
"
34401,"- I think there may be another reason.
"
34402,"So...
"
34403,"awkward hug or...
"
34404,"...lame cool guy handshake?
"
34405,"- Uh, lame cool guy handshake, yeah.
"
34406,"- Ma'am, I assure you, the plane is fine.
"
34407,"- And you fixed the phalange?
"
34408,"- Yes, the phalange is fixed.
"
34409,"As a matter of fact, we put a whole lot of
"
34410,"extra phalanges onboard, just in case.
"
34411,"- Where is she?
"
34412,"- I don't see her.
"
34413,"- There she is!
"
34414,"- excuse me, sir, do you have a boarding pass?
"
34415,"- No, no, I just have to talk to someone.
"
34416,"- I'm sorry, you cannot go any
"
34417,"further without a boarding pass.
"
34418,"- No, no, no, but...
"
34419,"- Oh my God... What.. What
"
34420,"are you guys doing here?
"
34421,"- Okay, you're on.
"
34422,"- What? What? Ross, you're scaring me.
"
34423,"What's going on?
"
34424,"- Okay, the thing is..
"
34425,"- Don't go.
"
34426,"- What?
"
34427,"- Please, please stay with me.
"
34428,"I am so in love with you.
"
34429,"Please, don't go.
"
34430,"- Oh my God.
"
34431,"- I know, I know. I shouldn't have
"
34432,"waited 'till now to say it, but I'm..
"
34433,"That was stupid, okay? I'm sorry,
"
34434,"but I'm telling you now.
"
34435,"I love you.
"
34436,"Do not get on this plane.
"
34437,"- Miss? Are you boarding the plane?
"
34438,"- Hey, hey. I know you love me.
"
34439,"... I know you do.
"
34440,"- Miss?
"
34441,"- I have to get on the plane.
"
34442,"- No, you don't.
"
34443,"- Yes, I do.
"
34444,"- No, you don't.
"
34445,"- They're waiting for me, Ross.
"
34446,"I can't do this right now, I'm sorry.
"
34447,"- I'm sorry.
"
34448,"- I'm so sorry.
"
34449,"- I really thought she'd stay.
"
34450,"- I'm sorry.
"
34451,"- Well, that's it.
"
34452,"Everything's packed.
"
34453,"- Wow, this is weird.
"
34454,"- I know.
"
34455,"- Yeah.
"
34456,"- Uh, does this mean there's nothing to eat?
"
34457,"- I put three lasagnas in your freezer.
"
34458,"- I love you!
"
34459,"- So did you guys make it in time?
"
34460,"- Yeah, yeah, he talked to her,
"
34461,"but she got on the plane anyway.
"
34462,"- Where's Ross?
"
34463,"- He went home,
"
34464,"He didn't want to see anybody.
"
34465,"- Ross, hi.
"
34466,"It's me. ...
"
34467,"..I just got back on the plane.
"
34468,"And I just feel awful...
"
34469,"...That is so not how I wanted things to end with us...
"
34470,"...It's just that I wasn't expecting to see you
"
34471,"and all of a sudden you're there and saying these things... And... 
"
34472,"And now I'm just sitting here and thinking
"
34473,"...of all the stuff I should have said, and I didn't.
"
34474,"I mean, I didn't even get to tell you that I love you too...
"
34475,"...Because of course I do.
"
34476,"... I love you....
"
34477,"...I love you...
"
34478,"...I love you...
"
34479,"What am I doing?
"
34480,"I love you! 
"
34481,"Oh, I've gotta see you.
"
34482,"I've gotta get off this plane.
"
34483,"- Oh my God!
"
34484,"- Excuse me?
"
34485,"- Miss? Please, sit down!
"
34486,"- I'm sorry. I'm really sorry
"
34487,"but I need to get off the plane,
"
34488,".....okay? I need to tell someone that I love love them.
"
34489,"- Miss, I can't let you off the plane.
"
34490,"- Let her off the plane!
"
34491,"- I am afraid you are gonna have to take a seat..
"
34492,"- Oh, please, miss, you don't understand!
"
34493,"- Try to understand!
"
34494,"- Oh, come on, miss, isn't there any way
"
34495,"that you can just let me off...
"
34496,"- No! No!
"
34497,"Oh my God. Did she get off the plane?
"
34498,"Did she get off the plane?
"
34499,"- I got off the plane.
"
34500,"- You got off the plane.
"
34501,"- I do love you.
"
34502,"- I love you too, and I'm never letting you go again.
"
34503,"- Okay. 'Cause this is where I wanna be,
"
34504,"okay? No more messing around.
"
34505,"I don't wanna mess this up again.
"
34506,"we're done being stupid.
"
34507,"- Okay. You and me, alright? This is it.
"
34508,"- This is it. Unless we're on a break.
"
34509,"- Don't make jokes now.
"
34510,"- Okay, please be careful with that.
"
34511,"It was my grandmother's. Be careful.
"
34512,"- If that falls off the truck,
"
34513,"it wouldn't be the worst thing.
"
34514,"- I know...
"
34515,"...It seems smaller somehow.
"
34516,"- Has it always been purple?
"
34517,"- Look around, you guys...
"
34518,"this was your first home.
"
34519,"...And it was a happy place...
"
34520,"....filled with love and laughter...
"
34521,".. But more important..
"
34522,".. because of rent control,
"
34523,"it was a friggin' steal!
"
34524,"- Hey, do you realise that at one time or another we all lived in this apartment?
"
34525,"- Oh yeah !
"
34526,"- That's true.
"
34527,"- Uh, I haven't.
"
34528,"- Wait a minute.
"
34529,"What about that
"
34530,"summer during college that you lived with grandma,
"
34531,"And you tried to make it as a dancer?
"
34532,"- Do you realise we almost made
"
34533,"it ten years without that coming up?
"
34534,"- Oh, honey, I forgot. I promised Treeger
"
34535,"that we'd leave our keys.
"
34536,"I guess this is it.
"
34537,"Yeah.
"
34538,"- Yeah. I guess so.
"
34539,"- This is harder than I thought it would be.
"
34540,"- Oh, it's gonna be okay.
"
34541,"- Do you guys have to go to the new
"
34542,"house right away, or do you have some time?
"
34543,"- We got some time.
"
34544,"- Okay, should we get some coffee?
"
34545,"- Sure.
"
34546,"Where?

34548,"[CAR HORNS HONKING]
"
34549,"There's nothing to tell.
"
34550,"It's just some guy I work with.
"
34551,"Come on.
"
34552,"You're going out with a guy.
"
34553,"There's gotta be something
"
34554,"wrong with him.
"
34555,"So does he have a hump
"
34556,"and a hair piece?
"
34557,"Wait. Does he eat chalk?
"
34558,"I don't want her to go through
"
34559,"what I went through with Carl. Oh.
"
34560,"Okay, everybody relax.
"
34561,"This is not even a date.
"
34562,"It's just two people going out
"
34563,"to dinner and not having sex.
"
34564,"Sounds like a date to me.
"
34565,"I'm back in high school,
"
34566,"in the middle of the cafeteria...
"
34567,"...and I realize I'm totally naked.
"
34568,"- Oh, yeah.
"
34569,"- I've had that dream.
"
34570,"Then I look down and I realize
"
34571,"there is a phone...
"
34572,"...there.
"
34573,"- Instead of...
"
34574,"- That's right!
"
34575,"MONICA: That one, I've never had.
"
34576,"PHOEBE: No.
"
34577,"All of a sudden,
"
34578,"the phone starts to ring.
"
34579,"And it turns out it's my mother.
"
34580,"Which is very, very weird
"
34581,"because she never calls me.
"
34582,"Hi.
"
34583,"This guy says ""hello,""
"
34584,"I wanna kill myself.
"
34585,"Are you okay, sweetie?
"
34586,"I feel like someone grabbed my small
"
34587,"intestine, pulled it out of my mouth...
"
34588,"...and tied it around my neck.
"
34589,"- Cookie?
"
34590,"Carol moved her stuff out today.
"
34591,"PHOEBE & JOEY:
"
34592,"Oh.
"

"
34594,"- Thanks.

"
34596,"No. No, don't!
"
34597,"Stop cleansing my aura.
"
34598,"Just leave my aura alone, okay?
"
34599,"I'll be fine. All right? Really.
"
34600,"I hope she'll be very happy.
"
34601,"- No, you don't.
"
34602,"- No, I don't.
"
34603,"To hell with her. She left me!
"
34604,"And you never knew she was a lesbian.
"
34605,"No! Okay?
"
34606,"Why does everyone
"
34607,"keep fixating on that?
"
34608,"She didn't know. How should I know?
"
34609,"Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian.
"
34610,"Did I say that out loud?
"
34611,"All right, Ross. Look, you're feeling
"
34612,"a lot of pain right now.
"
34613,"You're angry. You're hurting.
"
34614,"Can I tell you what the answer is?
"
34615,"Strip joints!
"
34616,"Come on, you're single.
"
34617,"Have some hormones.
"
34618,"See, but I don't want
"
34619,"to be single, okay?
"
34620,"I just wanna be married again.
"

"
34622,"Rachel?
"
34623,"Oh, God, Monica! Hi! Thank God!
"
34624,"I went to your building and
"
34625,"this guy with a hammer said...
"
34626,"...that you might be here, and you are.
"
34627,"- Can I get you some coffee?
"
34628,"- Decaf.
"
34629,"Okay, everybody, this is Rachel,
"
34630,"another Lincoln High survivor.
"
34631,"This is everybody.
"
34632,"This is Chandler and Phoebe...
"
34633,"...and Joey. And remember
"
34634,"my brother, Ross?
"
34635,"- Sure!
"
34636,"- Hey.
"
34637,"- Hi.
"
34638,"- Oh, God.
"
34639,"[SIGHS]
"
34640,"So you wanna tell us now, or are we
"
34641,"waiting for four wet bridesmaids?
"
34642,"Oh, God! Well, it started about
"
34643,"a half-hour before the wedding.
"
34644,"I was in this room
"
34645,"with all the presents...
"
34646,"...and I was looking
"
34647,"at this gravy boat.
"
34648,"This really gorgeous
"
34649,"Limoges gravy boat.
"
34650,"When all of a sudden...
"
34651,"Sweet 'N Low?
"
34652,"- I realized...
"
34653,"...I was more turned on by
"
34654,"this gravy boat than by Barry.
"
34655,"Then I got really freaked out,
"
34656,"and that's when it hit me:
"
34657,"How much Barry looks
"
34658,"like Mr. Potato Head.
"
34659,"You know, I mean, I always knew
"
34660,"he looked familiar, but...
"
34661,"Anyway, I just had to get out of there,
"
34662,"and I started wondering:
"
34663,"""Why am I doing this?""
"
34664,"And ""Who am I doing this for?""
"
34665,"Anyway, I just didn't know where to go,
"
34666,"and I know you and I have drifted apart...
"
34667,"...but you're the only person
"
34668,"I know in the city.
"
34669,"Who wasn't invited to the wedding.
"
34670,"Oh, I was kind of hoping that
"
34671,"wouldn't be an issue.
"
34672,"[SPEAKING IN SPANISH
"
34673,"ON TV]
"
34674,"I'm guessing he bought her
"
34675,"the big pipe organ...
"
34676,"...and she's really not
"
34677,"happy about it.
"
34678,"Daddy, I just... I can't marry him.
"
34679,"I'm sorry.
"
34680,"I just don't love him.
"
34681,"Well, it matters to me.
"
34682,"CHANDLER:
"
34683,"She should not be wearing those pants.
"
34684,"I say push her down the stairs.
"
34685,"ALL: Push her down the stairs!
"
34686,"Push her down the stairs!
"
34687,"[ALL CHEER AND APPLAUD]
"
34688,"Come on, Daddy, listen to me!
"
34689,"It's like all of my life, everyone's
"
34690,"always told me, ""You're a shoe!
"
34691,"You're a shoe! You're a shoe!
"
34692,"You're a shoe!""
"
34693,"Then today I stopped and said,
"
34694,"""What if I don't wanna be a shoe?
"
34695,"What if I wanna be a purse?
"
34696,"You know?
"
34697,"Or a hat?""
"
34698,"I don't want you to buy me a hat,
"
34699,"I am a hat.
"
34700,"It's a metaphor, Daddy!
"
34701,"You can see where he'd have trouble.
"
34702,"Look, Daddy, it's my life.
"
34703,"Well, maybe I'll just stay
"
34704,"here with Monica.
"
34705,"I guess we've established
"
34706,"she's staying with Monica.
"
34707,"Well, maybe that's my decision.
"
34708,"Well, maybe I don't need your money.
"
34709,"Wait! Wait! I said maybe!
"
34710,"Okay. Just breathe, that's it.
"
34711,"Just try to think of nice, calm things.
"
34712,"[SINGING] Raindrops on roses
"
34713,"And whiskers on kittens

"
34717,"With string

34718,"I'm all better now.

34719,"I helped.

"
34724,"you can always come to Joey.
"
34725,"Me and Chandler live right
"
34726,"across the hall. And he's away a lot.
"
34727,"Joey, stop hitting on her.
"
34728,"It's her wedding day.
"
34729,"What? Like there's a rule or something?
"
34730,"[INTERCOM BUZZES]

34731,"Please don't do that again.

34734,"- Buzz him in.

34735,"- Who's Paul?

"
34765,"Well, I was supposed to be headed
"
34766,"for Aruba on my honeymoon...
"
34767,"...so, nothing.
"
34768,"Right. You're not even
"
34769,"getting your honeymoon.
"
34770,"God. No, no. Although, Aruba. Heh.
"
34771,"This time of year? Eh.
"
34772,"Talk about your...
"
34773,"...big lizards.
"

"
34775,"like being alone tonight...
"
34776,"...Joey and Chandler are
"
34777,"helping me with my furniture.
"
34778,"Yes, and we're very excited about it.
"
34779,"Actually, thanks, but I'm just gonna
"
34780,"hang out here tonight.
"

"
34783,"Hey, Pheebs, you wanna help?
"
34784,"Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to.
"
34785,"I'm supposed to attach a bracket-y
"
34786,"thing to the side things...
"
34787,"...using a bunch of these
"
34788,"little worm guys.
"
34789,"I have no bracket-y thing,
"
34790,"I see no worm guys whatsoever...
"
34791,"...and I cannot feel my legs.
"
34792,"What's this?
"
34793,"I have no idea.
"
34794,"- Done with the bookcase.
"
34795,"- All finished.
"
34796,"This was Carol's favorite beer.
"
34797,"She always drank it out of the can.
"
34798,"I should have known.
"
34799,"Hey. Ross, let me ask you a question.
"
34800,"She got the furniture,
"
34801,"the stereo, the good TV.
"
34802,"What did you get?
"
34803,"You guys.
"
34804,"- Oh, God. Oh, my God.
"
34805,"- You got screwed.
"
34806,"- Oh, my God.
"
34807,"- I know, I know. I'm such an idiot.
"
34808,"I should've caught on when she went to
"
34809,"the dentist four and five times a week.
"
34810,"I mean, how clean can teeth get?
"
34811,"My brother's going through that.
"
34812,"He's such a mess.
"
34813,"How did you get through it?
"
34814,"He might try accidentally breaking
"
34815,"something valuable of hers.
"
34816,"- Say her...
"
34817,"- Leg?
"
34818,"Heh. That's one way of going through it,
"
34819,"yeah.
"
34820,"Me, I went for the watch.
"
34821,"- You actually broke her watch?
"
34822,"- Mm.
"
34823,"Barry, I'm sorry. I am so sorry.
"
34824,"You probably think it's about making
"
34825,"love with your socks on, but it isn't.
"
34826,"It isn't, it's about me. And I...
"
34827,"[SIGHS]
"
34828,"Hi. Machine cut me off again.
"
34829,"Anyway...
"
34830,"You know what's scary? What if
"
34831,"there's only one woman for everybody?
"
34832,"I mean, what if you get one
"
34833,"woman, and that's it?
"
34834,"Unfortunately, in my case,
"
34835,"there was only one woman for her.
"
34836,"What are you talking about?
"
34837,"One woman.
"
34838,"That's like saying there's only
"
34839,"one flavor of ice cream for you.
"
34840,"Let me tell you something, Ross.
"
34841,"There's lots of flavors out there.
"
34842,"There's rocky road and cookie dough
"
34843,"and bing cherry vanilla.
"
34844,"You can get them with jimmies
"
34845,"or nuts or whipped cream.
"
34846,"This is the best thing that
"
34847,"ever happened to you.
"
34848,"You got married. You were like, what, 8?
"
34849,"Welcome back to the world. Grab a spoon.
"
34850,"I honestly don't know
"
34851,"if I'm hungry or horny.
"
34852,"Then stay out of my freezer.
"
34853,"Ever since she walked out on me, I...
"
34854,"What? What?
"
34855,"You wanna spell it out with noodles?
"
34856,"No, it's more of a fifth date
"
34857,"kind of revelation.
"
34858,"Oh, so there's gonna be a fifth date?
"
34859,"Isn't there?
"
34860,"Yeah, yeah. I think there is.
"
34861,"What were you gonna say?
"

"
34873,"Two years.
"
34874,"Wow!
"

"
34878,"Yeah.
"
34879,"Yeah, I do.
"
34880,"I, Joanie, take you, Charles,

35297,"You remember the Lugwins?
"
35298,"The big one had a thing for you,
"
35299,"didn't she?
"
35300,"They all had a thing for him.
"
35301,"Oh, Mom.
"
35302,"I'm sorry.
"
35303,"Why is this girl going to call me?
"
35304,"Oh, she just graduated, and she wants
"
35305,"to be something in cooking or food...
"
35306,"...or I don't know.
"
35307,"Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant,
"
35308,"so...
"
35309,"No, Mom. I don't have a restaurant.
"
35310,"I work in a restaurant.
"
35311,"Well, they don't have to know that.
"
35312,"Ross, could you come and help me
"
35313,"with the spaghetti.
"
35314,"Yes.
"
35315,"Oh, we're having spaghetti. That's...
"
35316,"...easy.
"
35317,"I know this is going to sound
"
35318,"unbelievably selfish on my part...
"
35319,"...but were you planning on bringing
"
35320,"up the whole baby/lesbian thing?
"
35321,"Because I think it might take
"
35322,"some of the heat off me.
"
35323,"What that Rachel did to her life.
"
35324,"We ran into her parents at the club.
"
35325,"They were not playing very well.
"
35326,"I'm not gonna tell you
"
35327,"what they spent on that wedding...
"
35328,"...but $40,000 is a lot of money.
"
35329,"Well, at least she had the chance
"
35330,"to leave a man at the altar.
"
35331,"- What's that supposed to mean?
"
35332,"- Nothing.
"
35333,"- It's an expression.
"
35334,"- No, it's not.
"
35335,"Don't listen to your mother.
"
35336,"You're independent
"
35337,"and you always have been.
"
35338,"Even when you were a kid,
"
35339,"and you were chubby...
"
35340,"...and you had no friends,
"
35341,"you were just fine.
"
35342,"You'd read alone in your room.
"
35343,"And your puzzles...
"
35344,"Look, there are people, like Ross,
"
35345,"who need to shoot for the stars.
"
35346,"With his museum and his papers
"
35347,"getting published.
"
35348,"Other people are satisfied
"
35349,"with staying where they are.
"
35350,"I'm telling you, these are the people
"
35351,"who never get cancer.
"
35352,"And I read about these women
"
35353,"trying to have it all, and I thank God...
"
35354,"...our little Harmonica
"
35355,"doesn't seem to have that problem.
"
35356,"So, Ross, what's going on with you?
"
35357,"Any stories? No news, no little
"
35358,"anecdotes to share with the folks?
"
35359,"Okay, okay.
"
35360,"Ahem. Look, I, uh... I realize you guys
"
35361,"have been wondering...
"
35362,"...what exactly happened
"
35363,"between Carol and me.
"
35364,"And so, well, here's the deal.
"
35365,"Carol's a lesbian.
"
35366,"She's living with a woman named Susan.
"
35367,"She's pregnant with my child.
"
35368,"And she and Susan
"
35369,"are going to raise the baby.
"
35370,"And you knew about this?
"
35371,"Your folks are really that bad, huh?
"
35372,"Well, you know, these people are pros.
"
35373,"They know what they're doing.
"
35374,"They take their time.
"
35375,"They get the job done.
"
35376,"Boy, I know they say that
"
35377,"you can't change your parents.
"
35378,"Boy, if you could, I'd want yours.
"
35379,"Must pee.
"
35380,"You know, it's even worse
"
35381,"when you're twins.
"
35382,"- You're a twin?
"
35383,"- Oh, yeah. We don't speak.
"
35384,"She's like this high-powered,
"
35385,"driven, career-type.
"
35386,"- What does she do?
"
35387,"- She's a waitress.
"
35388,"All right. You guys,
"
35389,"I kind of gotta clean up now.
"
35390,"Chandler, you're an only child, right?
"
35391,"You don't have any of this.
"
35392,"Well, no, although I did
"
35393,"have an imaginary friend...
"
35394,"...who my parents actually preferred.
"
35395,"RACHEL:
"
35396,"Hit the lights, please.
"
35397,"How long was I in there?
"
35398,"I'm just cleaning up.
"
35399,"Oh, do you, uh...?
"
35400,"Do you need any help?
"
35401,"Um, okay, sure. Thanks.
"
35402,"[SIGHS]
"
35403,"Anyway...
"
35404,"So you nervous about Barry tomorrow?
"
35405,"- Oh, a little.
"
35406,"- Mm-hm.
"
35407,"- A lot.
"
35408,"- Mm-hm.
"
35409,"So got any advice?
"
35410,"You know, as someone
"
35411,"who's recently been dumped.
"
35412,"Well, you may want to steer clear
"
35413,"of the word ""dumped.""
"
35414,"Chances are he's going to be this
"
35415,"broken shell of a man. You know?
"
35416,"So you should try not to look too terrific.
"
35417,"I know it'll be hard.
"
35418,"Or, you know, hey, I'll go down there,
"
35419,"and I'll give Barry back his ring.
"
35420,"And you can go with Carol
"
35421,"and Susan to the OB-GYN.
"
35422,"You've got Carol tomorrow.
"
35423,"When did it get so complicated?
"
35424,"Got me.
"
35425,"- Remember when we were in high school?
"
35426,"- Yeah.
"
35427,"I mean, didn't you think
"
35428,"you' were gonna meet someone...
"
35429,"...fall in love, and that'd be it?
"
35430,"[SCOFFS]
"
35431,"- Ross?
"
35432,"- Yes, yes.
"
35433,"Oh. Man. I never thought I'd be here.
"
35434,"[ROSS CHUCKLES]
"
35435,"Me neither.
"
35436,"Hi. Sorry I'm late. I got stuck at work.
"
35437,"There was this big
"
35438,"dinosaur thing. Anyway...
"
35439,"Hi.
"
35440,"- Ross, you remember Susan.
"
35441,"- How could I forget?
"
35442,"Ross.
"
35443,"Hello, Susan. Good shake, good shake.
"
35444,"So, uh, we're just waiting for?
"
35445,"- Dr. Oberman.
"
35446,"- Dr. Oberman. Okay, and is he...?
"
35447,"- She.
"
35448,"- Of course, ""she.""
"
35449,"She, uh, familiar
"
35450,"with our special situation?
"
35451,"Yes, and she's very supportive.
"
35452,"Great. Okay, that's great. Heh.
"
35453,"No, I'm...
"
35454,"CAROL:
"
35455,"Thanks.
"
35456,"Quack, quack...
"
35457,"...quack, quack, quack.
"
35458,"Ross?
"
35459,"That opens my cervix.
"
35460,"- Barry?
"
35461,"BARRY: Come on in.
"
35462,"Are you sure?
"
35463,"BARRY: It's fine, it's fine.
"
35464,"Robbie's gonna be here for hours.
"
35465,"Huh?
"
35466,"So how are you doing?
"
35467,"I'm...
"
35468,"I'm okay.
"
35469,"You look great.
"
35470,"Yeah, well...
"
35471,"RECEPTIONIST [OVER SPEAKER]:
"
35472,"Dr. Farber, Jason Greenspan's gagging.
"
35473,"Be right there. I'll be back in a second.
"
35474,"I dumped him.
"
35475,"Okay.
"
35476,"Oh!
"
35477,"- Ross.
"
35478,"- So, um...? So how's this going to work...
"
35479,"...ahem, you know, with us?
"
35480,"You know, when, like, important
"
35481,"decisions have to be made?
"
35482,"Give me a ""for instance.""
"
35483,"Well, I don't know. Okay, okay.
"
35484,"- How about with the baby's name?
"
35485,"- Marlon...
"
35486,"- Marlon.
"
35487,"...if it's a boy. Minnie, if it's a girl.
"
35488,"As in ""Mouse""?
"
35489,"As in my grandmother.
"
35490,"Still, you say ""Minnie,""
"
35491,"you hear ""Mouse.""
"
35492,"How about, um...
"
35493,"How about ""Julia""?
"
35494,"Julia.
"
35495,"We agreed on Minnie.
"
35496,"It's funny, um, we agreed
"
35497,"we'd spend our lives together.
"
35498,"Things change. Roll with the punches.
"
35499,"I believe Julia's on the table.
"
35500,"Oh. Sorry about that.
"
35501,"So, what have you been up to?
"
35502,"Oh. Not much.
"
35503,"- I got a job.
"
35504,"- Hey, that's great.
"
35505,"Why are you so tan?
"
35506,"Oh, I, uh...
"
35507,"I went to Aruba.
"
35508,"Oh, no.
"
35509,"You went on our honeymoon alone?
"
35510,"No.
"
35511,"See, uh, I went with...
"
35512,"- Now, this may hurt.
"
35513,"- Me?
"
35514,"No.
"
35515,"I went with Mindy.
"
35516,"Mindy?
"
35517,"My maid of honor, Mindy?
"
35518,"Yeah, well, we're kind of a thing now.
"
35519,"[CHUCKLES]
"
35520,"Well, I'm...
"
35521,"You got plugs.
"
35522,"Careful, careful.
"
35523,"They haven't quite taken yet.
"
35524,"And you got lenses.
"
35525,"But you hate sticking
"
35526,"your finger in your eye.
"
35527,"Not for her.
"
35528,"Oh.
"
35529,"Listen, I really wanted to thank you.
"
35530,"Okay.
"
35531,"About a month ago, I wanted to hurt you...
"
35532,"...more than I've ever
"
35533,"wanted to hurt anyone in my life.
"
35534,"And I'm an orthodontist.
"
35535,"Wow.
"
35536,"You know, you were right.
"
35537,"I mean, I thought we were happy.
"
35538,"We weren't happy.
"
35539,"But with Mindy...
"
35540,"...now I'm happy.
"
35541,"- Spit.
"
35542,"- What?
"
35543,"Me.
"
35544,"Anyway, um...
"
35545,"I guess, uh... I guess this belongs to you.
"
35546,"And thank you for giving it to me.
"
35547,"Well, thank you for giving it back.
"
35548,"Hello.
"
35549,"Oh, please. What's wrong with Helen?
"
35550,"Helen Geller?
"
35551,"- I don't think so.
"
35552,"- Hello, it's not gonna be Helen Geller.
"
35553,"Thank you.
"
35554,"No. I mean, it's not Geller.
"
35555,"What, it's gonna be Helen Willick?
"
35556,"No, actually, um, we talked about
"
35557,"Helen Willick Bunch.
"
35558,"Well, wait a minute.
"
35559,"Why is she in the title?
"
35560,"Because it's my baby too.
"
35561,"That's funny. Really? I don't remember
"
35562,"you making any sperm.
"
35563,"And we all know what
"
35564,"a challenge that is.
"
35565,"- Uh-huh. See?
"
35566,"- All right, you two, stop it.
"
35567,"No, no. She gets a credit.
"
35568,"Hey, I'm in there too.
"
35569,"Honestly. You're not actually suggesting
"
35570,"Helen Willick Bunch Geller.
"
35571,"I think that borders on child abuse.
"
35572,"Of course not.
"
35573,"I'm suggesting Geller Willick Bunch.
"
35574,"Oh, no. No, no, no.
"
35575,"You see what he's doing?
"
35576,"He knows no one
"
35577,"is gonna say all those names.
"
35578,"He knows they'll wind up calling her Geller.
"
35579,"Then he gets his way.
"
35580,"My way? You think this is my way?
"
35581,"Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined
"
35582,"this moment in my life being...
"
35583,"...this is not my way. You know what?
"
35584,"This is too hard.
"
35585,"Knock, knock.
"
35586,"How are we today? Any nausea?
"
35587,"- A little.
"
35588,"- Just a little.
"
35589,"Well, I was just wondering about the
"
35590,"mother-to-be, but, uh, thanks for sharing.
"
35591,"Uh, lie back.
"
35592,"You know what? I'm gonna go.
"
35593,"Um, I don't think I can be involved
"
35594,"in this particular family thing.
"
35595,"[BABY'S HEART BEATING
"
35596,"OVER SONOGRAM]
"
35597,"Oh, my God.
"
35598,"Look at that.
"
35599,"I know.
"
35600,"Well, isn't that amazing?
"
35601,"What are we supposed
"
35602,"to be seeing here?
"
35603,"I don't know, but I think it's about
"
35604,"to attack the Enterprise.
"
35605,"You know, if you tilt your head
"
35606,"to the left and relax your eyes...
"
35607,"...it kind of looks like an old potato.
"
35608,"Then don't do that, all right?
"
35609,"Monica?
"
35610,"What do you think?
"
35611,"Mm-hm.
"
35612,"Are you welling up?
"
35613,"- No.
"
35614,"- You are.
"
35615,"- You are. You're welling up.
"
35616,"- No, I'm not.
"
35617,"- You're gonna be an aunt.
"
35618,"- Oh, shut up.
"
35619,"Hi, Mindy.
"
35620,"Hi, it's Rachel.
"
35621,"Yeah, I'm fine. I saw Barry today.
"
35622,"Oh, yeah, yeah, he told me.
"
35623,"No, it's okay. Really, it's okay.
"
35624,"I hope you two are very happy.
"
35625,"I really do.
"
35626,"And, Min, you know,
"
35627,"if everything works out...
"
35628,"...and you guys end up getting
"
35629,"married and having kids and everything...
"
35630,"...I just hope they have his
"
35631,"old hairline and your old nose.
"
35632,"Okay, I know it was a cheap shot,
"
35633,"but I feel so much better now.
"
35634,"- Hi, guys.
"
35635,"JOEY: Hey, Phoebe.
"
35636,"Hey, oh, how did it go?
"
35637,"Um, not so good.
"
35638,"He walked me to the subway and said,
"
35639,"""We should do this again.""
"
35640,"- Ouch.
"
35641,"- What? He said, ""We should do it again.""
"
35642,"That's good, right?
"
35643,"Uh, no. Loosely translated,
"
35644,"""We should do this again,"" means:
"
35645,"""You will never see me naked.""
"
35646,"Since when?
"
35647,"Since always. It's, like, dating language.
"
35648,"You know, like, ""It's not you,""
"
35649,"means, ""It is you.""
"
35650,"""You're such a nice guy,"" means:
"
35651,"""I'm gonna be dating
"
35652,"leather-wearing alcoholics...
"
35653,"...and complaining about them to you.""
"
35654,"Or, you know, um, ""I think we should see
"
35655,"other people,"" means:
"
35656,"""Ha, ha, I already am.""
"
35657,"And everybody knows this?
"
35658,"Oh, yeah. Cushions the blow.
"
35659,"Like when you're a kid
"
35660,"and your parents put your dog to sleep...
"
35661,"...and they tell you it went off
"
35662,"to live on some farm.
"
35663,"That's funny.
"
35664,"No, because, uh, our parents actually did...
"
35665,"...uh, send our dog off to live on a farm.
"
35666,"Uh, Ross?
"
35667,"Ha, ha. Hello.
"
35668,"The Milner's farm in Connecticut?
"
35669,"The Milners,
"
35670,"they had this unbelievable farm.
"
35671,"They had horses and rabbits
"
35672,"that he could chase.
"
35673,"And it was...
"
35674,"Oh, my God. Chi-Chi.
"
35675,"CHANDLER: ""So how does it feel
"
35676,"knowing you're about to die?""
"
35677,"Warden, in five minutes
"
35678,"my pain will be over.
"
35679,"But you'll have to live with the knowledge
"
35680,"that you sent an honest man to die.
"
35681,"- Hey, that was really good.
"
35682,"- Yeah?
"
35683,"- Yeah.
"
35684,"- Thanks. Let's keep going.
"
35685,"Okay. ""So, what do you want
"
35686,"from me, Dimon? Huh?""
"
35687,"I just wanna go back to my cell,
"
35688,"because in my cell, I can smoke.
"
35689,"""Smoke away.""
"
35690,"Heh.
"
35691,"[COUGHING]
"
35692,"I think this is probably why Dimon
"
35693,"smokes in his cell alone.
"
35694,"- What?
"
35695,"- Relax your hand.
"
35696,"Let your wrist go.
"
35697,"- Not so much.
"
35698,"- Whoa.
"
35699,"Hey.
"
35700,"All right. Now try taking a puff.
"
35701,"Right.
"
35702,"- Okay, no, give it to me.
"
35703,"- No, no, no. I'm not giving you a cigarette.
"
35704,"No, it's fine. It's fine. Look, do you want
"
35705,"to get this part or not? Here.
"
35706,"All right. Now, don't think
"
35707,"of it as a cigarette.
"
35708,"Think of it as the thing
"
35709,"that has been missing from your hand.
"
35710,"When you're holding it, you feel right.
"
35711,"- You feel complete.
"
35712,"- You miss it?
"
35713,"No, not so much.
"
35714,"All right. Now we smoke.
"
35715,"Oh, my God.
"
35716,"No, no, no.
"
35717,"They say it's the same as the distance
"
35718,"from the tip of a guy's thumb...
"
35719,"...to the tip of his index finger.
"
35720,"That's ridiculous.
"
35721,"Can I use either thumb?
"
35722,"All right. Don't tell me, don't tell me.
"
35723,"Decaf cappuccino for Joey.

35727,"- I'm getting pretty good at this.
"
35728,"- Excellent. That's very good.
"
35729,"Good for me.
"
35730,"[MUMBLING]
"
35731,"- You okay, Phoebe?
"
35732,"- Yeah, no, it's not even worth...
"
35733,"It's my bank.
"
35734,"What did they do to you?
"
35735,"It's nothing, it's just... Okay.
"
35736,"I'm going through my mail,
"
35737,"and I open up their monthly ""statement.""
"
35738,"Easy.
"
35739,"And there's 500 extra dollars
"
35740,"in my account.
"
35741,"Oh, Satan's minions at work again.
"
35742,"Yes, because now I have to go down there
"
35743,"and deal with them...
"
35744,"- What are you talking about? Keep it.
"
35745,"- It's not mine.
"
35746,"I didn't earn it.
"
35747,"If I kept it, it would be like stealing.
"
35748,"Yeah, but if you spent it,
"
35749,"it would be like shopping.
"
35750,"Okay. Okay.
"
35751,"Let's say I bought
"
35752,"a really great pair of shoes.
"
35753,"Do you know what I'd hear
"
35754,"with every step I took?
"
35755,"""Not mine. Not mine. Not mine.""
"
35756,"And even if I was happy, okay,
"
35757,"and skipping...
"
35758,"...I'd hear, ""Not mine. Not mine.""
"
35759,"We're with you. We got it.
"
35760,"Okay, I'd never be able to enjoy it.
"
35761,"It'd be like this giant karmic debt.
"
35762,"Chandler, what are you doing? Hey.
"
35763,"What are you doing?
"
35764,"Oh, gross.
"
35765,"- What is this?
"
35766,"- I'm smoking. I'm smoking. I'm smoking.
"
35767,"I can't believe you.
"
35768,"You've been so good for three years.
"
35769,"And this is my reward.
"
35770,"Hold on a second. Just think about what
"
35771,"you went through the last time you quit.
"
35772,"Okay, so this time I won't quit.
"
35773,"- Put it out.
"
35774,"- All right. I'm putting it out.
"
35775,"Oh, no.
"
35776,"I can't drink this now.
"
35777,"All right, I'm gonna go change.
"
35778,"I've got a date.
"
35779,"Is this Alan again? How's it going?
"
35780,"It's going pretty good, you know?
"
35781,"It's nice and we're having fun.
"
35782,"- So when do we get to meet the guy?
"
35783,"ROSS: Yeah.
"
35784,"Let's see, today's Monday...
"
35785,"- Never.
"
35786,"- Come on.
"
35787,"- No, not after what happened with Steve.
"
35788,"- What are you talking about?
"
35789,"[LISPING]
"
35790,"We love Steve. Steve was sexy.
"
35791,"[IN NORMAL VOICE]
"
35792,"Sorry.
"
35793,"Look, I don't know how I feel about him yet.
"
35794,"Give me a chance to figure it out.
"
35795,"Well, then can we meet him?
"
35796,"No.
"
35797,"[LISPING]
"
35798,"Sorry.
"
35799,"Why should I let them meet him?
"
35800,"I bring a guy home and within five minutes
"
35801,"they're all over him.
"
35802,"I mean, they're like coyotes picking off
"
35803,"the weak members of the herd.
"
35804,"Listen, as someone who's seen
"
35805,"more than her share of bad beef...
"
35806,"...I'll tell you, that is not
"
35807,"such a terrible thing.
"
35808,"Come on, they're your friends.
"
35809,"They're looking out after you.
"
35810,"I know, I know. I wish that once I'd
"
35811,"bring a guy home they actually liked.
"
35812,"Well, you do realize that the odds
"
35813,"of that happening are a little slimmer...
"
35814,"...if they never get to meet the guy.
"
35815,"Let it go, Ross.
"
35816,"Yeah? Well, you didn't know Chi-Chi.
"
35817,"MONICA:
"
35818,"Do you all promise?
"
35819,"- Yeah, we promise. We'll be good.
"
35820,"JOEY: We promise.
"
35821,"Chandler, do you promise to be good?
"
35822,"[THUNDER CRASHING]
"
35823,"You can come in, but your filter tip
"
35824,"little buddy has to stay outside.
"
35825,"ROSS:
"
35826,"Hey, Pheebs.
"
35827,"""Dear Ms. Buffay: Thank you
"
35828,"for calling attention to our error.
"
35829,"We have credited your account $500.
"
35830,"We're sorry for the inconvenience...
"
35831,"...and hope you'll accept
"
35832,"this football phone...
"
35833,"...as our free gift."" Do you believe this?
"
35834,"Now I have $1000 and a football phone.
"
35835,"What bank is this?
"
35836,"[DOOR BUZZES]
"
35837,"Okay, it's him.
"
35838,"- Who is it?
"
35839,"ALAN: Alan.
"
35840,"Chandler. He's here.
"
35841,"Okay, please be good. Please?
"
35842,"I mean, remember how much
"
35843,"you like me.
"
35844,"[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
"
35845,"Hi. Alan, this is everybody.
"
35846,"Everybody, this is Alan.
"
35847,"- Hi.
"
35848,"GROUP: Hey.
"
35849,"[LISPING] I've heard so much
"
35850,"about all you guys.
"
35851,"MONICA:
"
35852,"Thanks, I'll call you tomorrow.
"
35853,"Okay.
"
35854,"Okay, let's let the Alan-bashing begin.
"
35855,"Who's gonna take the first shot?
"
35856,"Hmm?
"
35857,"Come on.
"
35858,"I'll go.
"
35859,"Let's start with the way
"
35860,"he kept picking at...
"
35861,"You know, I'm sorry, I can't do this.
"
35862,"Can't do it. We loved him.
"
35863,"GROUP: We loved him.
"
35864,"- Wait a minute.
"
35865,"We're talking about someone
"
35866,"that I'm going out with?
"
35867,"GROUP: Yes.
"
35868,"- And did you notice?
"
35869,"GROUP:
"
35870,"Yeah.
"
35871,"Know what was great?
"
35872,"The way his smile was kind of crooked.
"
35873,"Yes, yes. Like the man in the shoe.
"
35874,"What shoe?
"
35875,"From the nursery rhyme.
"
35876,"""There was a crooked man
"
35877,"who had a crooked smile...
"
35878,"...who lived in a shoe for a while...""
"
35879,"So I think Alan...
"
35880,"...will become the yardstick...
"
35881,"...against which all future boyfriends
"
35882,"will be measured.
"
35883,"What future boyfriends?
"
35884,"No, no. I think this could be,
"
35885,"you know, ""it.""
"
35886,"- Really?
"
35887,"- Oh, yeah.
"
35888,"I'd marry him just for his
"
35889,"David Hasselhoff impression alone.
"
35890,"You know I'm gonna be doing that
"
35891,"at parties, right?
"
35892,"- You know what I like most about him?
"
35893,"- What?
"
35894,"The way he makes me feel about myself.
"
35895,"ALL:
"
35896,"Yeah.
"
35897,"Hi.
"
35898,"How was the game?
"
35899,"Well...
"
35900,"- We won!
"
35901,"- We won! Thank you! Yeah.
"
35902,"Fantastic. I have one question:
"
35903,"How is that possible?
"
35904,"- Alan.
"
35905,"- He was unbelievable.
"
35906,"He was like that Bugs Bunny cartoon
"
35907,"where Bugs is playing all the positions.
"
35908,"But instead of Bugs, it was first base, Alan.
"
35909,"Second base, Alan...
"
35910,"I mean, it was like he made us
"
35911,"into a team.
"
35912,"Yep. We sure showed
"
35913,"those Hasidic jewelers...
"
35914,"...a thing or two about softball.
"
35915,"- Nice.
"
35916,"Can I ask you guys a question?
"
35917,"Do you ever think that Alan
"
35918,"is maybe sometimes...
"
35919,"- What?
"
35920,"- I don't know. A little too Alan?
"
35921,"Oh, no. That's not possible.
"
35922,"You can never be too Alan.
"
35923,"Yeah, it's his innate Alan-ness
"
35924,"that we adore.
"
35925,"- I, personally, could have a gallon of Alan.
"
35926,"- Oh!
"
35927,"- Hey, Lizzy.
"
35928,"- Hey, Weird Girl.
"
35929,"- I brought you alphabet soup.
"
35930,"- Did you pick out the vowels?
"
35931,"Yes, but I left in the Y's.
"
35932,"Because, you know, ""Sometimes Y.""
"
35933,"Um, I also have something else for you.
"
35934,"Saltines?
"
35935,"No, but would you like $1000
"
35936,"and a football phone?
"
35937,"What?
"
35938,"Oh, my God.
"
35939,"- Oh, my God. There's really money in here.
"
35940,"- I know.
"
35941,"Weird Girl, what are you doing?
"
35942,"Oh, I want you to have it. I don't want it.
"
35943,"No, no. I have to give you something.
"
35944,"No, it's fine. You don't...
"
35945,"Do you want my tinfoil hat?
"
35946,"No, because you need that.
"
35947,"No, it's okay. Thanks.
"
35948,"Please. Let me do something.
"
35949,"Okay, all right. I'll tell you what.
"
35950,"You buy me a soda
"
35951,"and then we're even. Okay?
"
35952,"- Okay.
"
35953,"PHOEBE: Okay.
"
35954,"Keep the change.
"
35955,"Thanks, Lizzy.
"
35956,"Sure you don't want a pretzel?
"
35957,"- No, I'm fine. Thanks.
"
35958,"- See you.
"
35959,"Huh.
"
35960,"A thumb?
"
35961,"GROUP:
"
35962,"Ew.
"
35963,"I know, I know.
"
35964,"I opened it up and there it was...
"
35965,"...just floating in there,
"
35966,"like this tiny little hitchhiker.
"
35967,"Maybe it's a contest, you know?
"
35968,"Like ""Collect all five.""
"
35969,"Does, um, anyone wanna see?
"
35970,"No, thanks.
"
35971,"- Oh, hey, don't do that. Come on.
"
35972,"- Cut that out.
"
35973,"It's worse than the thumb.
"
35974,"Hey, this is so unfair.
"
35975,"- Why is it unfair?
"
35976,"- So I have a flaw. Big deal.
"
35977,"Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking
"
35978,"isn't annoying?
"
35979,"And Ross, with his over-pronouncing
"
35980,"every single word.
"
35981,"And Monica, with that snort
"
35982,"when she laughs.
"
35983,"I mean, what the hell is that thing?
"
35984,"I accept all those flaws.
"
35985,"Why can't you accept me for this?
"
35986,"Does the knuckle-cracking
"
35987,"bother everybody, or just him?
"
35988,"Well...
"
35989,"...I could live without it.
"
35990,"Huh.
"
35991,"Well, is it, like, a little annoying? Or
"
35992,"is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?
"
35993,"Now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, all right?
"
35994,"I think it's endearing.
"
35995,"Oh, you do, do you?
"
35996,"[LAUGHING]
"
35997,"[SNORTS]
"
35998,"You know, there's nothing wrong
"
35999,"with speaking correctly.
"
36000,"Indeed there isn't.
"
36001,"I should really get back to work.
"
36002,"Yeah, otherwise someone might
"
36003,"get what they actually ordered.
"
36004,"Oh. The hair comes out
"
36005,"and the gloves come off.
"
36006,"[GROUP SHOUTING]
"
36007,"Did you ever go out with a guy
"
36008,"your friends all really like?
"
36009,"No.
"
36010,"Okay. Well, I'm going out with a guy
"
36011,"my friends all really like.
"
36012,"We talking about the coyotes here?
"
36013,"Heh. All right. A cow got through.
"
36014,"Can you believe it?
"
36015,"It's just, you know what?
"
36016,"I just don't feel the thing.
"
36017,"I mean, they feel the thing.
"
36018,"I don't feel the thing.
"
36019,"Honey, you should always...
"
36020,"...feel the thing.
"
36021,"Listen, if that's how you feel
"
36022,"about the guy, Monica, dump him.
"
36023,"I know, it's just gonna be really hard.
"
36024,"Yeah, he's a big boy. He'll get over it.
"
36025,"No, he'll be fine.
"
36026,"It's the other five I'm worried about.
"
36027,"Do you have any respect for your body?
"
36028,"Don't you realize
"
36029,"what you're doing to yourself?
"
36030,"Hey, you know, I've had it
"
36031,"with you and your cancer...
"
36032,"...and your emphysema
"
36033,"and your heart disease.
"
36034,"The bottom line is, smoking is cool,
"
36035,"and you know it.
"
36036,"Ahem. Chandler?
"
36037,"It's Alan. He wants to speak to you.
"
36038,"Really? He does?
"
36039,"Hey, buddy. What's up?
"
36040,"Oh, she told you about that, huh?
"
36041,"Well, yeah. I have one now and then.
"
36042,"Well, yeah, now.
"
36043,"Well, it's not that bad...
"
36044,"Well, that's true.
"
36045,"Gee, you know, no one's
"
36046,"ever put it like that before.
"
36047,"Well, okay. Thanks.
"
36048,"God, he's good.
"
36049,"If only he were a woman.
"
36050,"Yeah.
"
36051,"CHANDLER:
"
36052,"Oh, Lamb Chop.
"
36053,"How old is that sock?
"
36054,"If I had a sock on my hand
"
36055,"for 30 years, it'd be talking too.
"
36056,"Okay, I think it's time to change
"
36057,"somebody's nicotine patch.
"
36058,"Hey.
"
36059,"Where's Joey?
"
36060,"Joey ate my last stick of gum,
"
36061,"so I killed him.
"
36062,"Do you think that was wrong?
"
36063,"- I think he's across the hall.
"
36064,"- Thanks.
"
36065,"There you go.
"
36066,"Ooh, I'm alive with pleasure now.
"
36067,"Hey, Pheebs, you gonna
"
36068,"have the rest of that Pop Tart?
"
36069,"Does anyone want the rest
"
36070,"of this Pop Tart?
"
36071,"Hey, I might.
"
36072,"I'm sorry.
"
36073,"You know, those stupid soda people
"
36074,"gave me $7000 for the thumb.
"
36075,"- Oh, my God.
"
36076,"- Seven thousand dollars?
"
36077,"And on my way over here,
"
36078,"I stepped in gum.
"
36079,"What is up with the universe?
"
36080,"What's going on?
"
36081,"Nothing. I just think it's nice
"
36082,"when we're all here together.
"
36083,"It's even nicer when everyone
"
36084,"gets to wear their underwear.
"
36085,"- Uh, Joey...
"
36086,"- Oh.
"
36087,"MONICA: Okay.
"
36088,"- Oh, come on.
"
36089,"Please, guys, we have to talk.
"
36090,"Wait, wait. I'm getting a dÃ©jÃ  vu.
"
36091,"No, I'm not.
"
36092,"- All right, we have to talk.
"
36093,"- There it is.
"
36094,"Okay, it's about Alan.
"
36095,"There's something you should know.
"
36096,"Oh, man, there's really
"
36097,"no easy way to say this. Uh...
"
36098,"I've decided to break up with Alan.
"
36099,"Is there somebody else?
"
36100,"No, no, no. It's just...
"
36101,"...you know, things change.
"
36102,"People change.
"
36103,"We didn't change.
"
36104,"So that's it? It's over?
"
36105,"Just like that?
"
36106,"You know, you let your guard down.
"
36107,"You know, you start to really care
"
36108,"about someone, and I just...
"
36109,"- Look, I could go on pretending...
"
36110,"- Okay.
"
36111,"No. No, that wouldn't be fair to me...
"
36112,"...it wouldn't be fair to Alan,
"
36113,"or to you.
"
36114,"Yeah, well, who wants fair?
"
36115,"I mean, I just want things back,
"
36116,"you know, the way they were.
"
36117,"- I'm sorry.
"
36118,"- Oh, she's sorry. I feel better.
"
36119,"I just can't believe this.
"
36120,"I mean, with the holidays coming up.
"
36121,"I wanted him to meet my family.
"
36122,"I'll meet someone else.
"
36123,"There'll be other Alans.
"
36124,"Yeah, right.
"
36125,"- Are you guys gonna be okay?
"
36126,"- Hey, hey. We'll be fine.
"
36127,"We're just gonna need a little time.
"
36128,"I understand.
"
36129,"Wow.
"
36130,"- I'm really sorry.
"
36131,"- Yeah. I mean, I'm sorry too.
"
36132,"But I gotta tell you, I'm a little relieved.
"
36133,"- Relieved?
"
36134,"- Yeah, well...
"
36135,"...I mean, I had a great time with you.
"
36136,"I just can't stand your friends.
"
36137,"Remember when we went
"
36138,"to Central Park and rented boats?
"
36139,"That was fun.
"
36140,"Yeah. He could row like a Viking.
"
36141,"- Hi.
"
36142,"GROUP: Hi.
"
36143,"So how'd it go?
"
36144,"- You know.
"
36145,"- Did he mention us?
"
36146,"He says he's really gonna
"
36147,"miss you guys.
"
36148,"ROSS:
"
36149,"You had a rough day, huh?
"
36150,"- Oh, you have no idea.
"
36151,"ROSS: Come here.
"
36152,"- That's it. I'm getting cigarettes.
"

36578,"Excuse me.
"
36579,"We've been here for over an hour...
"
36580,"...and people less sick than my friend
"
36581,"have gone in.
"
36582,"I mean, that guy with the toe thing?
"
36583,"Who's he sleeping with?
"
36584,"Oh, come on, Dora. Don't be mad.
"
36585,"I know we both said some things...
"
36586,"...we didn't mean...
"
36587,"...but that doesn't mean
"
36588,"we still don't love each other.
"
36589,"You know, I feel like I've lost her.
"
36590,"[YELLS]
"
36591,"- Lights still out?
"
36592,"- Yeah.
"
36593,"Well, maybe they're napping.
"
36594,"Heh. Please. They're having sex.
"
36595,"MONICA & PHOEBE:
"
36596,"Shut up.
"
36597,"So, what do you think George is like?
"
36598,"- I think he's shy.
"
36599,"- Oh, yeah?
"
36600,"Yeah. I think you have to draw him out.
"
36601,"And then when you do,
"
36602,"he's a preppy animal.
"
36603,"[ALL LAUGHING]
"
36604,"Come on.
"
36605,"I remember the moonlight coming in
"
36606,"through the open window...
"
36607,"...and her face
"
36608,"had the most incredible glow.
"
36609,"Yes, the moon, the glow,
"
36610,"the magical feeling.
"
36611,"You did this part.
"
36612,"Could I get some painkillers over here,
"
36613,"please?
"
36614,"He's right, enough already.
"
36615,"What is the big deal about today?
"
36616,"So you slept with her for the first time.
"
36617,"So what?
"
36618,"You slept with her
"
36619,"for seven years after that.
"
36620,"It's just a little more complicated
"
36621,"than that.
"
36622,"What? What is it? That she left you?
"
36623,"That she likes women?
"
36624,"That she left you for a woman
"
36625,"that likes women?
"
36626,"A little louder.
"
36627,"There's a man on the 12th floor in a coma
"
36628,"who didn't quite hear you.
"
36629,"Then what?
"
36630,"My first time with Carol was...
"
36631,"Was my...
"
36632,"[MUMBLES INDISTINCTLY]
"
36633,"What?
"
36634,"It was my first...
"
36635,"...time.
"
36636,"With Carol?
"
36637,"Oh.
"
36638,"So in your whole life,
"
36639,"you've only been with one?
"
36640,"Oh.
"
36641,"Oh, boy. Hockey was a big mistake.
"
36642,"There's a whole bunch of stuff
"
36643,"we could've done tonight.
"
36644,"Okay. Okay, I got one.
"
36645,"Do you remember that vegetarian pÃ¢tÃ©
"
36646,"that I made that you loved so much?
"
36647,"Uh-huh.
"
36648,"[MONICA & RACHEL GIGGLE]
"
36649,"Well, unless goose is a vegetable...
"
36650,"- Oh! Oh!
"
36651,"MONICA & RACHEL: Ha-ha-ha.
"
36652,"Okay, fine, fine.
"
36653,"Now I don't feel so bad
"
36654,"about sleeping with Jason Hurley.
"
36655,"- What? You slept with Jason?
"
36656,"- You had already broken up.
"
36657,"- How long?
"
36658,"- Just a couple hours.
"
36659,"Oh, that's nice.
"
36660,"Okay, okay, okay, I got one.
"
36661,"Anyway.
"
36662,"The valentine Tommy Rollerson left
"
36663,"in your locker was really from me.
"
36664,"Excuse me?
"
36665,"Oh, hello?
"
36666,"Like he was really gonna send you one.
"
36667,"She was a big girl.
"
36668,"[LAUGHS]
"
36669,"Really?
"
36670,"Well, at least big girls don't pee
"
36671,"in their pants in seventh grade.
"
36672,"I was laughing. You made me laugh.
"
36673,"Oh, my God.
"
36674,"There he is. There he is. There he is.
"
36675,"- Where?
"
36676,"- Right where we've been looking all night.
"
36677,"- Oh, he's so cute.
"
36678,"- Oh, George, baby, drop the towel.
"
36679,"- Come on, drop the towel.
"
36680,"RACHEL & PHOEBE: Drop the towel.
"
36681,"MONICA:
"
36682,"Please drop the towel. Drop it.
"
36683,"ALL:
"
36684,"Wow.
"
36685,"Man, can you believe he's only had sex
"
36686,"with one woman?
"
36687,"I think it's great.
"
36688,"You know, it's sweet. It's romantic.
"
36689,"Really?
"
36690,"No, are you kidding?
"
36691,"The guy's a freak. I judge him.
"
36692,"- Hey, man.
"
36693,"- Hey, buddy.
"
36694,"ROSS:
"
36695,"Ah? Ah?
"
36696,"Oh.
"
36697,"That's attractive.
"
36698,"Oh, I thought you were great
"
36699,"in Silence of the Lambs.
"
36700,"[JOEY LAUGHING]
"
36701,"Oh, come on, admit it,
"
36702,"all things considered, you had fun tonight.
"
36703,"Fun? Where was the fun?
"
36704,"Tell me specifically,
"
36705,"which part was the fun part?
"
36706,"Where's my puck?
"
36707,"- Oh. The kid has it.
"
36708,"- The kid?
"
36709,"Ahem. Excuse me, uh, that's my puck.
"
36710,"I found it.
"
36711,"Finders keepers, losers weepers.
"
36712,"You gotta do it, man.
"
36713,"Oh, yeah? Well, I'm rubber, you're glue.
"
36714,"Whatever you...
"
36715,"I can't do it.
"
36716,"- Listen, uh, give me back my puck.
"
36717,"- No.
"
36718,"- Yes, how about?
"
36719,"- No.
"
36720,"- No, come here. Just give me my puck.
"
36721,"- No, no, no.
"
36722,"SIZEMORE:
"
36723,"Hey, no roughhousing in my ER.
"
36724,"Give me my puck! Unh.
"
36725,"[GRUNTS]
"
36726,"Now, that was fun.
"
36727,"ROSS:
"
36728,"Okay, Monica.
"
36729,"Right foot, red.
"
36730,"Could've played Monopoly, but no.
"
36731,"[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
"
36732,"Thanks.
"
36733,"Okay, Pheebs. Right hand, blue.
"
36734,"- Good.
"
36735,"JOEY: Hmm?
"
36736,"[PHONE RINGS]
"
36737,"Hello?
"
36738,"- Oh. Rachel, it's the Visa-card people.
"
36739,"RACHEL: Oh, okay. Will you take my place?
"
36740,"All right. Yes, this is Rachel.
"
36741,"RACHEL: No.
"
36742,"- Oh.
"
36743,"Hello?
"
36744,"Oh, yeah. No, I know.
"
36745,"I haven't been using it much.
"
36746,"Oh, well, thanks, but I'm okay, really.
"
36747,"To the green, to the green.
"
36748,"MONICA: Oh, no.
"
36749,"- To the green.
"
36750,"I've got magic beans.
"
36751,"No, no, never mind.
"
36752,"CHANDLER:
"
36753,"To the left. To the left.
"
36754,"[ALL YELL]
"
36755,"I'm fine.
"
36756,"Would you let it go?
"
36757,"It's not a big deal.
"
36758,"ROSS: Not a big deal?
"
36759,"It's amazing.
"
36760,"You just reach in, there's one
"
36761,"little maneuver, and bam!
"
36762,"A bra. Right out the sleeve.
"
36763,"As far as I'm concerned...
"
36764,"...there is nothing a guy can do
"
36765,"that comes close. Right?
"
36766,"Come on!
"
36767,"You guys can pee standing up.
"
36768,"We can? Okay, I'm trying that.
"
36769,"You know what blows my mind?
"
36770,"Women can see breasts
"
36771,"anytime they want.
"
36772,"You just look down,
"
36773,"and there they are.
"
36774,"How you get any work done
"
36775,"is beyond me.
"
36776,"What I don't get is the way
"
36777,"guys can do so many mean things...
"
36778,"...and then not even care.
"
36779,"Multiple orgasms!
"
36780,"So Saturday night, the big night.
"
36781,"Date night!
"
36782,"Saturday night. Saturday night!
"
36783,"- No plans, huh?
"
36784,"- Not a one.
"
36785,"Not even, say,
"
36786,"breaking up with Janice?
"
36787,"Oh, right, right. Shut up.
"
36788,"Chandler, nobody likes
"
36789,"breaking up with someone.
"
36790,"- You just gotta do it.
"
36791,"- I know. But it's just so hard.
"
36792,"You're sitting with her.
"
36793,"She has no idea what's happening.
"
36794,"You finally get up
"
36795,"the courage to do it.
"
36796,"There's that awkward moment
"
36797,"when you've handed her the note.
"
36798,"Why do you have to break up with her?
"
36799,"Be a man. Just stop calling.
"
36800,"If you want, I'll do it with you.
"
36801,"Thanks, but she'd feel like
"
36802,"we were ganging up on her.
"
36803,"I mean you break up with Janice.
"
36804,"I'll break up with Tony.
"
36805,"You're breaking up with Tony?
"
36806,"I know. He's sweet, but it's just
"
36807,"not fun anymore.
"
36808,"I don't know if it's me or
"
36809,"his hunger strike. I don't know.
"
36810,"Does anybody want anything else?
"
36811,"Yeah. Last week you had a wonderful nutty,
"
36812,"chocolate-y, kind of cake-y pie thing that...
"
36813,"Nothing. I'm fine.
"
36814,"What's the matter?
"
36815,"Why so scrunchie?
"
36816,"It's my father. He wants to give me
"
36817,"a Mercedes convertible.
"
36818,"That guy, he burns me up.
"
36819,"Yeah, well, it's a Mercedes
"
36820,"if I move back home.
"
36821,"It was horrible!
"
36822,"He called me ""young lady.""
"
36823,"Ooh, I hate when my father
"
36824,"calls me that.
"
36825,"Did he give you that whole
"
36826,"""You're not up to this"" thing again?
"
36827,"Yeah, I got the extended disco
"
36828,"version with three choruses of:
"
36829,"""You'll never make it on your own.""
"
36830,"[SINGS]
"
36831,"Uh-huh, uh-huh
"
36832,"Hi, Joey.
"
36833,"Oh, my God. Angela.
"
36834,"Wow. Being dumped by you
"
36835,"obviously agrees with her.
"
36836,"- Are you gonna go over there?
"
36837,"- No.
"
36838,"Yeah. No.
"
36839,"Okay, but not yet.
"
36840,"I don't wanna seem too eager.
"
36841,"One Mississippi, two Mississippi...
"
36842,"...three Mississippi.
"
36843,"That seems pretty cool.
"
36844,"Hey, Angela.
"
36845,"Joey.
"
36846,"You look good.
"
36847,"Because I'm wearing a dress
"
36848,"that accents my boobs.
"
36849,"You don't say.
"
36850,"So, Rachel, what are you
"
36851,"doing tonight?
"
36852,"Big glamour night.
"
36853,"Me and Monica at Launderama.
"
36854,"Oh.
"
36855,"You wanna hear a freakish coincidence?
"
36856,"Guess who's doing laundry there too?
"
36857,"- Who?
"
36858,"- Me.
"
36859,"Was that not clear?
"
36860,"Hey, why don't...?
"
36861,"Why don't I just
"
36862,"join you both there?
"
36863,"Don't you have a laundry room
"
36864,"in your building?
"
36865,"Yes.
"
36866,"I do have a laundry room
"
36867,"in my building.
"
36868,"Um... But there's a rat problem.
"
36869,"Apparently, they're attracted to
"
36870,"the dryer sheets.
"
36871,"They're going in fine,
"
36872,"but they're coming out all...
"
36873,"...fluffy.
"
36874,"Anyway, 7-ish?
"
36875,"Sure.
"
36876,"Forget it, Joey.
"
36877,"I'm with Bob now.
"
36878,"Bob? Who the hell's Bob?
"
36879,"Bob is great.
"
36880,"He's smart, he's sophisticated,
"
36881,"and he has a real job.
"
36882,"You go on three auditions a month
"
36883,"and you call yourself an actor. But Bob...
"
36884,"Come on. We were great together.
"
36885,"And not just at the fun stuff,
"
36886,"but, like, talking too.
"
36887,"Sorry, Joey. You said,
"
36888,"""Let's just be friends.""
"
36889,"So guess what?
"
36890,"- What?
"
36891,"- We're just friends.
"
36892,"Fine. Fine.
"
36893,"So why don't the four of us go out and
"
36894,"have dinner tonight? You know, as friends.
"
36895,"What ""four of us""?
"
36896,"You and Bob,
"
36897,"and me and my girlfriend, um...
"
36898,"...Monica.
"
36899,"JOEY: Monica, I'm telling you, this guy
"
36900,"is perfect for you.
"
36901,"Forget it! Not after your cousin
"
36902,"who could belch the alphabet.
"
36903,"Come on, this guy's great.
"
36904,"His name's Bob. He's Angela's...
"
36905,"...ahem, brother.
"
36906,"He's smart, he's sophisticated...
"
36907,"...and he has a real job.
"
36908,"Me, I go on three auditions a month
"
36909,"and call myself an actor, but Bob is...
"
36910,"- Oh, God, help us.
"
36911,"- What?
"
36912,"Ugly Naked Guy is laying kitchen tile.
"
36913,"BOTH:
"
36914,"Ew!
"
36915,"Look, I'm asking a favor here.
"
36916,"I'm thinking if I do this
"
36917,"for her brother...
"
36918,"...maybe Angela will come back to me.
"
36919,"What's going on here?
"
36920,"You go out with tons of girls.
"
36921,"I know, but...
"
36922,"Look, I made a huge mistake.
"
36923,"I never should've broke up with her.
"
36924,"Will you help me? Please?
"
36925,"Okay. Bye.
"
36926,"Monica's not coming.
"
36927,"It's just gonna be me and Rachel.
"
36928,"[ROSS CHUCKLES]
"
36929,"Hold on there, camper.
"
36930,"You sure you've thought this through?
"
36931,"It's laundry. The thinking
"
36932,"through is pretty minimal.
"
36933,"It's just you and Rachel?
"
36934,"Just the two of you?
"
36935,"This is a date.
"
36936,"You're going on a date.
"
36937,"Nuh-uh.
"
36938,"Yeah-huh.
"
36939,"What are you saying?
"
36940,"I should shave again?
"
36941,"Pick up some wine? What?
"
36942,"Well, you may wanna rethink
"
36943,"the dirty underwear.
"
36944,"It's the first time she'll see your
"
36945,"underwear. You want it to be dirty?
"
36946,"No.
"
36947,"And the fabric softener?
"
36948,"Okay, okay.
"
36949,"Now, what is wrong with my Snuggles?
"
36950,"What? It says I'm a sensitive,
"
36951,"warm kind of guy.
"
36952,"You know, like a little fuzzy bear.
"
36953,"I can pick something else
"
36954,"up on the way.
"
36955,"MONICA:
"
36956,"Thank you.
"
36957,"So what does this Bob guy
"
36958,"look like? Is he tall, short?
"
36959,"Yep.
"
36960,"Which?
"
36961,"Which what?
"
36962,"You've never met Bob, have you?
"
36963,"No, but...
"
36964,"For all we know,
"
36965,"he could be horribly...
"
36966,"Horribly attractive.
"
36967,"I'll be shutting up now.
"
36968,"Where are they? Where are they?
"
36969,"This is nice. We never
"
36970,"do anything, just the two of us.
"
36971,"That's great. Maybe tomorrow we can
"
36972,"rent a car, run over some puppies.
"
36973,"Ew. I don't wanna do that.
"
36974,"- Here we go.
"
36975,"- Have a good breakup.
"
36976,"- Hey, Janice.
"
36977,"- My God, I am so glad you called me.
"
36978,"I had the most supremely awful day.
"
36979,"That's not good.
"
36980,"Can I get an espresso
"
36981,"and a latte over here, please?
"
36982,"We got the proofs from that
"
36983,"photo shoot with the vegetables.
"
36984,"They sucked.
"
36985,"I blew off the rest of the afternoon.
"
36986,"I went shopping.
"
36987,"And I got you...
"
36988,"JANICE:
"
36989,"I'm looking. I'm looking.
"
36990,"I'm looking.
"
36991,"- I got you...
"
36992,"- What?
"
36993,"- What?
"
36994,"- What did you get me there?
"
36995,"I got you...
"
36996,"...these.
"
36997,"Bullwinkle socks.
"
36998,"- That's so sweet.
"
36999,"- I knew you had the Rockys.
"
37000,"So you could wear
"
37001,"Bullwinkle and Bullwinkle...
"
37002,"...or wear Rocky and Rocky,
"
37003,"or you can mix and match.
"
37004,"Moose and squirrel.
"
37005,"Whatever you want.
"
37006,"I'm gonna get another espresso.
"
37007,"More latte?
"
37008,"No.
"
37009,"No, I'm still working on mine.
"
37010,"[JANICE LAUGHS OBNOXIOUSLY]
"
37011,"That's it?
"
37012,"Yeah, it was really hard.
"
37013,"Yeah, the hug looked pretty brutal.
"
37014,"Okay, you weren't there.
"
37015,"WOMAN:
"
37016,"Coming through! Move! Move!
"

"
37018,"using that machine.
"
37019,"Yeah, well, now you're kind of not.
"
37020,"But I saved it.
"
37021,"I put my basket on top.
"
37022,"- I'm sorry. Is that your basket?
"
37023,"- Yes.
"
37024,"It's really pretty.
"
37025,"Unfortunately, I don't see suds!
"
37026,"What?
"
37027,"No suds, no save, okay?
"
37028,"- What's going on?
"
37029,"- Hi.
"
37030,"Nothing. This horrible woman
"
37031,"just took my machine.
"
37032,"Was your basket on top?
"
37033,"- Yeah, but there were no suds.
"
37034,"- So?
"
37035,"You know, no suds, no save.
"
37036,"No suds, no... Excuse me.
"
37037,"Hold on a second!
"
37038,"This is my friend's machine.
"
37039,"Hey, hey, hey!
"
37040,"Her stuff wasn't in it!
"
37041,"Hey, hey, hey! That's not
"
37042,"the rule, and you know it!
"
37043,"All right. Show's over.
"
37044,"Nothing to see here.
"
37045,"Okay. Let's do laundry.
"
37046,"That was amazing!
"
37047,"I can't even send back soup.
"
37048,"Well, that's because you're
"
37049,"such a sweet, gentle...
"
37050,"Do you, uh?
"
37051,"Oh, hey. You must need detergent.
"
37052,"- What's that?
"
37053,"- Ãberweiss.
"
37054,"It's new. It's German.
"
37055,"It's extra tough!
"
37056,"Rach, do you...?
"
37057,"Are you gonna separate those?
"
37058,"Oh, God. Ugh.
"
37059,"Am I being like a total laundry spaz?
"
37060,"Am I supposed to use one machine
"
37061,"for shirts and another for pants?
"
37062,"Have you...?
"
37063,"Have you never done this before?
"
37064,"Well, not myself.
"
37065,"But I know other people that have.
"
37066,"Okay. You caught me.
"
37067,"I'm a laundry virgin.
"
37068,"Don't worry.
"
37069,"I'll use the gentle cycle.
"
37070,"[BOTH CHUCKLE]
"
37071,"Okay...
"
37072,"Basically, you wanna use
"
37073,"one machine for all your whites.
"
37074,"Whites. Okay.
"
37075,"- A whole other machine for your colors.
"
37076,"- Colors.
"
37077,"And then a third for your, uh...
"
37078,"...delicates.
"
37079,"And that would be your bras...
"
37080,"...and your underpanty things.
"
37081,"Okay, well,
"
37082,"these are white cotton panties.
"
37083,"Would they go with whites
"
37084,"or with delicates?
"
37085,"That would be a judgment call.

"
37093,"- Oh, my God!
"
37094,"What?
"

"
37096,"...falling.

"
37098,"So you and Angela, huh?
"
37099,"Yep. Pretty much.

"

"

"
37119,"...and has an emotional age beyond 8.
"
37120,"You know what else?
"
37121,"He's unbelievable in bed!
"
37122,"Wow!
"
37123,"My brother never even told me
"
37124,"when he lost his virginity.
"
37125,"Huh.
"
37126,"That's nice.
"
37127,"You can do this. It's like
"
37128,"pulling off a Band-Aid.
"
37129,"Just do it really fast,
"
37130,"and then the wound is exposed.

"

"
37771,"""Shut up! This is great!""

"
37777,"He's saying, you know,
"

"
37904,"Is it a vestibule?
"
37905,"Maybe it's an atrium?
"
37906,"Yeah, that is the part
"
37907,"to focus on, you idiot.
"
37908,"Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just stuck
"
37909,"at the bank in an ATM vestibule.
"
37910,"Jill says vestibule...
"
37911,"...I'm going with vestibule.
"
37912,"JILL:
"
37913,"I'm fine.
"
37914,"No, I'm not alone.
"
37915,"I don't know. Some guy.
"
37916,"Oh, some guy. I am some guy.
"
37917,"Hey, Jill, I saw you
"
37918,"with some guy last night.
"
37919,"Yes, he was some guy.
"
37920,"JOEY:
"
37921,"Hey, everyone.
"
37922,"Officiating at tonight's blackout
"
37923,"is Rabbi Tribbiani.
"
37924,"Chandler's old roommate was Jewish, and
"
37925,"these are the only candles we have...
"
37926,"...so happy Hanukkah.
"
37927,"PHOEBE: Ooh, look. Ugly Naked Guy
"
37928,"lit a bunch of candles.
"
37929,"ALL:
"
37930,"Ooh.
"
37931,"Oh!
"
37932,"Ooh. That had to hurt.
"
37933,"CHANDLER [THINKING]: All right, all right.
"
37934,"It's been 14 and a half minutes...
"
37935,"...and you still haven't said
"
37936,"one word. Oh, God.
"
37937,"Do something.
"
37938,"Just make contact. Smile.
"
37939,"There you go.
"
37940,"You're definitely scaring her.
"
37941,"Uh, would you like to call somebody?
"
37942,"Yeah, about 300 guys I went
"

"
37944,"Yeah, thanks.

"

"
37962,"What's up, man?
"
37963,"[MUMBLING]
"
37964,"I'm stuck...
"
37965,"...in an ATM vestibule...

"
37971,"[MUMBLES INDISTINCTLY]
"
37972,"[IN NORMAL VOICE] Yeah, like that thought
"
37973,"never entered my mind.
"
37974,"RACHEL:
"
37975,"Come on, somebody.
"
37976,"MONICA:
"
37977,"I'll go. I'll go.
"
37978,"Okay, um, senior year of college,
"
37979,"on a pool table.
"
37980,"JOEY: Ooh.
"
37981,"- Pool table?
"
37982,"That's my sister.
"
37983,"Okay, okay.
"
37984,"My weirdest place would have to be...
"
37985,"...the women's room on the second floor
"
37986,"of the New York City Public Library.
"
37987,"Oh, my God. What were you
"
37988,"doing in a library?
"
37989,"- Pheebs, what about you?
"
37990,"- Oh, um, Milwaukee.
"
37991,"Uh, Ross?

37992,"[CLEARS THROAT]
"
37993,"Disneyland, 1989.
"
37994,"""It's a small world after all.""
"
37995,"No way.
"
37996,"The, uh, ride broke down...
"
37997,"...so Carol and I went behind a couple
"
37998,"of those mechanical Dutch children.
"
37999,"They fixed the ride, and we were asked
"
38000,"never to return to the Magic Kingdom.
"
38001,"Ooh. Rachel?
"
38002,"I already went.
"
38003,"- You did not go.
"
38004,"- Yes, I did.
"
38005,"MONICA:
"
38006,"Tell us. Come on.
"
38007,"All right, uh, the weirdest place
"
38008,"would have to be...
"
38009,"...the foot of the bed.
"
38010,"- Step back.
"
38011,"- We have a winner.
"
38012,"I've never had a relationship
"
38013,"with that kind of passion.
"
38014,"Where you have to have somebody right
"
38015,"there in the middle of a theme park.
"
38016,"It was the only thing to do there
"
38017,"that didn't have a line.
"
38018,"Well, Barry wouldn't even kiss me
"
38019,"on a miniature-golf course.
"
38020,"- Come on.
"
38021,"- No.
"
38022,"He said we were holding up
"
38023,"the people behind us.
"
38024,"And you didn't marry him because?
"
38025,"Do you think there are people
"
38026,"that go through life...
"
38027,"...never having that kind of?
"
38028,"- Probably.
"
38029,"- Really?
"
38030,"I'll tell you something.
"
38031,"Passion is way overrated.
"
38032,"- Yeah, right.
"
38033,"- It is.
"
38034,"Eventually, it kind of burns out.
"
38035,"But hopefully what you're left
"
38036,"with is trust and security and, uh...
"
38037,"In my ex-wife's case,
"
38038,"lesbianism.
"
38039,"For all those people who miss out
"
38040,"on that, uh, passion thing...
"
38041,"...there's other good stuff.
"
38042,"Okay.
"
38043,"But, um, I don't think that'll be you.
"
38044,"- You don't?
"
38045,"- Mm-mm.
"
38046,"See, I see, uh...
"
38047,"...big passion in your future.
"
38048,"- Really?
"
38049,"- Mm-hm.
"
38050,"- You do?
"
38051,"- I do.
"
38052,"Ross, you're so great.
"
38053,"ROSS:
"
38054,"Ah.
"
38055,"It's never gonna happen.
"
38056,"- What?
"
38057,"- You and Rachel.
"
38058,"[CHUCKLES]
"
38059,"[STUTTERS]
"
38060,"Why not?
"
38061,"Because you waited too long
"
38062,"to make your move...
"
38063,"...and now you're in the ""Friend Zone.""
"
38064,"No, no, no.
"
38065,"I'm not in the Zone.
"
38066,"No, Ross.
"
38067,"You're mayor of the Zone.
"
38068,"Look, I'm taking my time, all right?
"
38069,"I'm laying the groundwork.
"
38070,"Every day I get
"
38071,"a little bit closer to, uh...
"
38072,"Priesthood.
"
38073,"Ross, I'm telling you, she has
"
38074,"no idea what you're thinking.
"
38075,"If you don't ask her out soon,
"
38076,"you'll end up stuck in the Zone forever.
"
38077,"I will, I will.
"
38078,"I'm waiting for the, uh, right moment.
"
38079,"What?
"
38080,"- What, now?
"
38081,"- Yeah.
"
38082,"What's messing you up?
"
38083,"The wine?
"
38084,"The candles? The moonlight? Huh?
"
38085,"You gotta go up to her and say,
"
38086,"""Look, Rachel, I think...""
"
38087,"- Shh!
"
38088,"- Shh!
"
38089,"- What are we shushing?
"
38090,"- We're shushing...
"
38091,"...because we're trying to
"
38092,"hear something.
"
38093,"- What?
"
38094,"- Uh, don't you hear that?
"
38095,"Ah.
"
38096,"- See?
"
38097,"- Huh.
"
38098,"- Would you like some gum?
"
38099,"- Oh. Is it sugarless?
"
38100,"- Uh, sorry, it's not.
"
38101,"- Then, no, thanks.
"
38102,"CHANDLER [THINKING]:
"
38103,"What the hell was that?
"
38104,"Mental note: If Jill Goodacre
"
38105,"offers you gum, you take it.

38127,"MONICA: Outside.
"
38128,"You can't go out there.
"
38129,"- Why not?
"
38130,"- Because of, uh, the reason.
"
38131,"And that would be?
"
38132,"I, uh... I can't tell you.
"
38133,"What's going on?
"
38134,"Okay, listen. You gotta promise you'll
"
38135,"never, ever tell Ross that I told you.
"
38136,"- About what?
"
38137,"- He's planning your birthday party.
"
38138,"Oh, my God. I love him.

"
38143,"- Oh, stop it. Joey already told me.
"
38144,"Well, he didn't tell me.
"
38145,"Don't look at me.
"
38146,"This is Ross' thing.

38149,"- You are not. We tell you stuff.
"
38150,"- Uh-huh.
"
38151,"I was the last one to know when Chandler

"

"

"
38253,"Ah. Well, there you go.
"
38254,"Last to know again.
"

"
38297,"...those three seconds were more exciting
"
38298,"than three weeks in Bermuda with Barry.
"
38299,"Did you rent mopeds?
"
38300,"Because I've heard...
"
38301,"Oh, it's not about that right now. Okay.
"
38302,"I know it's totally superficial,
"
38303,"and we have nothing in common...
"
38304,"...and we don't even speak

"
38306,"...but, God.
"
38307,"Paolo, hi.
"
38308,"- Ross.
"
38309,"- Listen, uh...
"
38310,"Listen, um, heh,
"
38311,"something you should, uh, know.

38315,"- Thing. Yes, thing.
"
38316,"- You have the sex?
"
38317,"- No.
"
38318,"No, no. Um, technically,
"
38319,"the sex is not being had. But that's, uh...
"
38320,"That's not the point.
"
38321,"The point is that, uh,
"
38322,"Rachel and I should be, uh...
"
38323,"Well, Rachel and I
"
38324,"should be together.
"
38325,"And if you get in the, uh...
"
38326,"- In bed?
"
38327,"- No.
"
38328,"Ha. No, not where I was going.
"
38329,"If you get in the way of us
"
38330,"becoming a thing...
"
38331,"...then, uh, I would be, well, very sad.
"
38332,"Oh.
"
38333,"So do you, um?
"
38334,"[BOTH SPEAK IN ITALIAN]

38346,"Look, look. The last candle's
"
38347,"about to burn out.
"
38348,"Ten, nine, eight, seven...
"
38349,"...minus 46, minus 47,
"
38350,"minus 48...
"
38351,"ROSS: Thank you.
"
38352,"MONICA: Thanks.
"
38353,"ROSS:
"
38354,"Kind of spooky without any lights.
"
38355,"[JOEY LAUGHS MANIACALLY]
"
38356,"[ALL LAUGH MANIACALLY]
"
38357,"ROSS:
"
38358,"Okay, guys, I have the definitive one.
"
38359,"[ROSS LAUGHS MANIACALLY]
"
38360,"[GROANS]
"
38361,"Uh, Ross...
"
38362,"This probably isn't the best time
"
38363,"to bring it up...
"
38364,"...but you have to throw
"
38365,"a party for Monica.
"
38366,"- This has been fun.
"
38367,"- Yes.
"
38368,"Yes. Thanks for, uh, letting me
"
38369,"use your phone...
"
38370,"...and for saving my life.
"
38371,"Well, goodbye, Chandler.
"
38372,"I had a great blackout.
"
38373,"See you.
"
38374,"Hi. Um, I'm account number 7143457.
"
38375,"And I don't know if you got any of that...
"
38376,"...but I would really
"
38377,"like a copy of the tape.
"
38378,"Hey, gorgeous. How's it going?
"
38379,"Dehydrated Japanese noodles
"
38380,"under fluorescent lights.
"
38381,"Does it get better than this?
"
38382,"Question: You're not dating, are you?
"
38383,"I met somebody who would be
"
38384,"perfect for you.
"
38385,"You see, perfect might be a problem.
"
38386,"Had you said co-dependent
"
38387,"or self-destructive...
"
38388,"- You want a date Saturday?
"
38389,"- Yes, please.
"
38390,"He is cute.
"
38391,"- He's funny. He's...
"
38392,"- He's a he?
"
38393,"Well, yeah.
"
38394,"Oh, God. I just...
"
38395,"You're nice... Oh, God.
"
38396,"Good, Shelly. Okay. I'm gonna go
"
38397,"flush myself down the toilet now.
"
38398,"Okay. Bye-bye.
"
38399,"CHANDLER: It's hard to enjoy noodles
"
38400,"after that. Is that ridiculous?
"
38401,"Can you believe she actually
"
38402,"thought that?
"
38403,"Um...
"
38404,"Yeah.
"
38405,"Well, when I first met you,
"
38406,"I thought maybe...
"
38407,"...possibly...
"
38408,"...you might be.
"
38409,"You did?
"
38410,"Then you spent Phoebe's birthday
"
38411,"party talking to my breasts...
"
38412,"...so then I figured maybe not.
"
38413,"Huh. Did, uh, any of the rest of you guys
"
38414,"think that when you first met me?
"
38415,"- I did.
"
38416,"- I think so.
"
38417,"- Not me.
"
38418,"- No, no, me neither.
"
38419,"Although, uh, back in college,
"
38420,"Susan Saladore did.
"
38421,"You're kidding.
"
38422,"- Did you tell her I wasn't?
"
38423,"- No.
"
38424,"It's because I wanted
"
38425,"to go out with her too.
"
38426,"So I told her, actually,
"
38427,"you were seeing Bernie Spellman...
"
38428,"...who also liked her.
"
38429,"Well, this is fascinating.
"
38430,"So, uh, what is it about me?
"
38431,"I don't know. Because you're smart,
"
38432,"you're funny...
"
38433,"Ross is smart and funny.
"
38434,"You ever think that about him?
"
38435,"- Ha, ha. Yeah, right.
"
38436,"- What is it?
"
38437,"Okay, I don't know. You just...
"
38438,"You have a quality.
"
38439,"- Yes, exactly.
"
38440,"- Right?
"
38441,"Yeah, a quality.
"
38442,"""A quality."" Good. I was worried
"
38443,"you were gonna be vague about this.
"
38444,"[PHONE RINGS]
"
38445,"Hello?
"
38446,"Oh. Rachel.
"
38447,"It's Paolo calling from Rome.
"
38448,"Oh, my God. Calling from Rome.
"
38449,"[SPEAKS IN ITALIAN]
"
38450,"So he's calling from Rome.
"
38451,"I could do that.
"
38452,"Just gotta go to Rome.
"
38453,"Monica, your dad just beeped in.
"
38454,"Can you make it quick?
"
38455,"I'm talking to Rome.
"
38456,"Hey, Dad. What's up?
"
38457,"Oh, God.
"
38458,"Ross, it's Nana.
"
38459,"Hey.
"
38460,"MONICA: How you doing?
"
38461,"ROSS: Hey, Dad.
"
38462,"So, uh, how's she doing?
"
38463,"The doctor says
"
38464,"it's a matter of hours.
"
38465,"- How are you, Mom?
"
38466,"- Me? I'm fine, fine.
"
38467,"I'm glad you're here.
"
38468,"What's with your hair?
"
38469,"What?
"
38470,"What's different?
"
38471,"Nothing.
"
38472,"Oh, maybe that's it.
"
38473,"She's unbelievable.
"
38474,"Her mother's...
"
38475,"Okay, relax, relax.
"
38476,"We are gonna be here a while,
"
38477,"it looks like.
"
38478,"We still have boyfriends
"
38479,"and your career to cover.
"
38480,"Oh, God.
"
38481,"The fuzzy little mints
"
38482,"at the bottom of her purse.
"
38483,"Oh.
"
38484,"Yeah, they were gross.
"
38485,"Oh, you know what I love?
"
38486,"Her Sweet 'N Lows.
"
38487,"How she was always stealing them
"
38488,"from restaurants.
"
38489,"Not just restaurants,
"
38490,"from our house.
"
38491,"Mrs. Geller?
"
38492,"ROSS:
"
38493,"She looks so small.
"
38494,"I know.
"
38495,"Well, at least she's with Pop-Pop
"
38496,"and Aunt Phyllis now.
"
38497,"Goodbye, Nana.
"
38498,"Bye, Nana.

"
38501,"Ross!
"
38502,"Nurse.
"
38503,"What is going on?
"
38504,"You know, uh, how the nurse said
"
38505,"Nana had passed?
"
38506,"Well, she's not quite.
"
38507,"- What?
"
38508,"- She's not passed.
"
38509,"She's present. She's back.
"
38510,"What's going on?
"
38511,"She may have died.
"
38512,"""She may have died""?
"
38513,"We're looking into it.
"
38514,"Uh, I'll go see.
"
38515,"[HEART MONITOR BEEPING]
"
38516,"This almost never happens.
"
38517,"[HEART MONITOR STOPS]
"
38518,"Now she's passed.
"
38519,"I just have to know, okay?
"
38520,"Is it my hair?
"
38521,"Yes, Chandler, that's exactly what it is.
"
38522,"It's your hair.
"
38523,"Yeah, you have homosexual hair.
"
38524,"RACHEL: Hey.
"
38525,"MONICA: Hi.
"
38526,"RACHEL:
"
38527,"So did she?
"
38528,"Twice.
"
38529,"Oh, that sucks.
"
38530,"You guys okay?
"
38531,"I don't know. It's weird.
"
38532,"I know she's gone,
"
38533,"but I just don't feel, uh...
"
38534,"Maybe that's because
"
38535,"she's not really gone.
"
38536,"No, no, she's gone.
"
38537,"We checked.
"
38538,"A lot.
"
38539,"No, I mean, maybe no one
"
38540,"ever really goes.
"
38541,"Ever since my mom died,
"
38542,"every now and then...
"
38543,"...I get this feeling that she's,
"
38544,"like, right here, you know?
"
38545,"Oh. And Debbie, my best friend
"
38546,"from junior high...
"
38547,"...got struck by lightning
"
38548,"on a miniature golf course.
"
38549,"I always get this strong
"
38550,"Debbie vibe...
"
38551,"...whenever I use
"
38552,"one of those little yellow pencils.
"
38553,"I miss her.
"
38554,"Aw. Here, Pheebs.
"
38555,"Want this?
"
38556,"- Oh, thanks.
"
38557,"- Sure.
"
38558,"I just sharpened her this morning.
"
38559,"See, I don't believe any of that.
"
38560,"I think when you're dead...
"
38561,"...you're dead. You're gone.
"
38562,"You're worm food.
"
38563,"So Chandler looks gay, huh?
"
38564,"I don't know who this is,
"
38565,"but it's not Debbie.
"
38566,"I thought it'd be a closed casket.
"
38567,"Well, that doesn't mean
"
38568,"she can't look nice.
"
38569,"Sweetie, you think
"
38570,"you can get in there?
"
38571,"I don't see why not.
"
38572,"ROSS:
"
38573,"Here's my retainer.
"
38574,"I was just thinking...
"
38575,"...when my time comes...
"
38576,"- Dad.
"
38577,"Listen to me.
"
38578,"When my time comes,
"
38579,"I wanna be buried at sea.
"
38580,"You what?
"
38581,"I wanna be buried at sea.
"
38582,"It looks like fun.
"
38583,"Define ""fun.""
"
38584,"Come on. You'll make a day of it.
"
38585,"You'll get a boat, pack a lunch...
"
38586,"And then we throw your body in
"
38587,"the water. Gee, that does sound fun.
"
38588,"Everyone thinks they know me.
"
38589,"Everyone says, ""Jack Geller,
"
38590,"so predictable.""
"
38591,"Maybe after I'm gone, they'll say,
"
38592,"""Buried at sea? Huh.""
"
38593,"That's probably what they'll say.
"
38594,"I'd like that.
"
38595,"- Hey, gorgeous.
"
38596,"- Hey.
"
38597,"Look, I'm sorry about yesterday.
"
38598,"Don't worry about it. Apparently,
"
38599,"other people have made the same mistake.
"
38600,"Oh. Okay. Phew.
"
38601,"So, uh, what do you think it is about me?
"
38602,"I don't know what.
"
38603,"You just have...
"
38604,"...a quality.
"
38605,"- A quality. Right. Great.
"
38606,"It's a shame, because you and Lowell
"
38607,"would've made a great couple.
"
38608,"Lowell? Financial Services Lowell?
"
38609,"That's who you saw me with?
"
38610,"What? He's cute.
"
38611,"Well, yeah.
"
38612,"He's no Brian in Payroll.
"
38613,"Is Brian?
"
38614,"No. I don't know. The point is,
"
38615,"if you were gonna set me up...
"
38616,"...I'd like to think it'd be
"
38617,"with somebody like him.
"
38618,"Well, I think Brian's
"
38619,"a little out of your league.
"
38620,"Excuse me. You don't think
"
38621,"I could get a Brian?
"
38622,"Because I could get a Brian.
"
38623,"Believe you me.
"
38624,"I'm really not.
"
38625,"ROSS:
"
38626,"This one?
"
38627,"No.
"
38628,"I've shown you every dress we have.
"
38629,"Unless you want her to spend eternity
"
38630,"in a lemon-yellow pantsuit...
"
38631,"...go with the burgundy.
"
38632,"Whatever we pick, she would've
"
38633,"told us it's the wrong one.
"
38634,"You're right.
"
38635,"We'll go with the burgundy.
"
38636,"A fine choice. I'm coming out.
"
38637,"Wait. We need shoes.
"
38638,"Okay. Uh...
"
38639,"How about these?
"
38640,"That's really a day shoe.
"
38641,"And where she's going,
"
38642,"everyone else will be dressier?
"
38643,"Could we see something
"
38644,"in a slimmer heel?
"
38645,"Okay. I have nothing in an evening shoe
"
38646,"in the burgundy.
"
38647,"I can show you something
"
38648,"in a silver that may work.
"
38649,"No, it really should be burgundy.
"
38650,"- Unless we go with a different dress.
"
38651,"- Yes.
"
38652,"No, no, no. Watch this.
"
38653,"Wait, I may have something in the back.
"
38654,"Oh, my God.
"
38655,"Is everything all right, dear?
"
38656,"Yeah. Yeah.
"
38657,"Just Nana's stuff.
"
38658,"How we doing?
"
38659,"You guys ready?
"
38660,"Mom called to remind me
"
38661,"not to wear my hair up.

"
38663,"my best feature?
"
38664,"Some days it's all I can think about.
"
38665,"Hi. I'm sorry I'm late.
"
38666,"I couldn't find my bearings.
"
38667,"Heh. You mean your earrings?
"
38668,"What did I say?
"
38669,"[RACHEL CLEARS THROAT]
"
38670,"- Are these the shoes?
"
38671,"- Yes. Paolo sent them from Italy.
"
38672,"What? We, uh, don't have shoes here?
"
38673,"Morning. We ready to go?
"
38674,"Don't we look nice all dressed up?
"
38675,"It's stuff like that, isn't it?

38676,"- It was a beautiful service.
"
38677,"- It really was.

"
38790,"...would you tell her?
"
38791,"Tell her what?
"
38792,"How she drove you crazy,
"
38793,"picking on every little detail.
"
38794,"Like your hair, for example.
"
38795,"I'm not sure I know
"
38796,"what you're getting at.
"
38797,"Would things have been better
"
38798,"if you'd just told her the truth?
"
38799,"No.
"
38800,"I think some things are
"
38801,"better left unsaid.
"
38802,"I think it's nicer when people
"
38803,"just get along.
"
38804,"Ha.
"
38805,"More wine, dear?
"
38806,"Oh, I think so.
"
38807,"Those earrings look
"
38808,"really lovely on you.
"
38809,"Thank you.
"
38810,"They're yours.
"
38811,"Actually, they were Nana's.
"
38812,"MEN:
"
38813,"No!
"
38814,"Now I'm depressed.
"
38815,"Even more than I was.
"
38816,"Hey, who's this little naked guy?
"
38817,"Uh, that little naked guy would be me.
"
38818,"Aw. Look at the little thing.
"
38819,"Yes, fine.
"
38820,"That is my penis.
"
38821,"Can we be grownups now?
"
38822,"- Who are those people?
"
38823,"- Got me.
"
38824,"- That's Nana right there in the middle.
"
38825,"- Wow.
"
38826,"Yeah, let's see.
"
38827,"""Me and the gang at Java Joe's.""
"
38828,"Wow. Monica, you look just like
"
38829,"your grandmother.
"
38830,"How old was she there?
"
38831,"Let's see. ""1939.""
"
38832,"Uh, twenty-four, twenty-five.
"
38833,"Huh. It looks like a fun gang.
"
38834,"Ooh, look, look, look.
"
38835,"I got Monica naked.
"
38836,"Let me see.
"
38837,"No, no. That would be me again.
"
38838,"I'm, uh, just trying something.
"
38839,"- Hey, Lowell.
"
38840,"- Oh, hey, Chandler.
"
38841,"So how's it going in
"
38842,"Financial Services?
"
38843,"It's like Mardi Gras without
"
38844,"the papier-mÃ¢chÃ© heads.
"
38845,"How about you?
"
38846,"Good. Good. Listen, um, heh...
"
38847,"...I don't know what Shelly told you
"
38848,"about me, but, uh...
"
38849,"...I'm not.
"
38850,"I know. That's what I told her.
"
38851,"- Really?
"
38852,"- Yeah.
"
38853,"So you can tell?
"
38854,"Pretty much. Most of the time.
"
38855,"We have a kind of radar.
"
38856,"So you don't think I have...
"
38857,"...a quality?
"
38858,"Speaking for my people,
"
38859,"I'd have to say no.
"
38860,"By the way, your friend Brian
"
38861,"from Payroll? He is.
"
38862,"- He is?
"
38863,"- Yep.
"
38864,"And way out of your league.
"
38865,"Out of my league.
"
38866,"I could get a Brian. If I wanted to
"
38867,"get a Brian, I could get a Brian.
"
38868,"Hey, Brian.
"
38869,"Terry, I know I haven't worked here
"
38870,"very long...
"
38871,"...but I was wondering,
"
38872,"do you think it would be possible...
"
38873,"...if I got a $100 advance on my salary?
"
38874,"An advance?
"
38875,"It's so that I can spend Thanksgiving
"
38876,"with my family.
"
38877,"See, every year, we go skiing in Vail,
"
38878,"and normally my father pays for my ticket...
"
38879,"...but I've sort of started
"
38880,"this whole independent thing, you know...
"
38881,"...which is actually why I took this ""job.""
"
38882,"Rachel, Rachel, sweetheart.
"
38883,"You're a terrible, terrible waitress.
"
38884,"Really, really awful.
"
38885,"Okay, I hear what you're saying.
"
38886,"I'm with you.
"
38887,"Um...
"
38888,"But I'm trying really hard,
"
38889,"and I think I'm doing better.
"
38890,"I really do.
"
38891,"Does anybody need coffee?
"
38892,"MAN: Yeah, over here.
"
38893,"WOMAN: Yeah, I do.
"
38894,"Heh. Look at that.
"
38895,"Excuse me, sir?
"
38896,"Hi. You come in here all the time.
"
38897,"MAN: Uh-huh.
"
38898,"- I was just wondering...
"
38899,"...you think there's a possibility
"
38900,"you could give me an advance on my tips?
"
38901,"Huh? No.
"
38902,"RACHEL: Okay, okay. That's fine, fine.
"
38903,"Sorry about that spill before.
"
38904,"[SIGHS]
"
38905,"Only 98.50 to go.
"
38906,"- Hey. Hey.
"
38907,"ROSS & CHANDLER: Hey.
"
38908,"Ross, did you know that Mom and Dad
"
38909,"are going to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving?
"
38910,"What? No, they're not.
"
38911,"- Yes, they are. The Blymans invited them.
"
38912,"- You're wrong.
"
38913,"- I am not wrong.
"
38914,"- You're wrong.
"
38915,"No, I just talked to them.
"
38916,"I'm calling Mom.
"
38917,"- Hey, hey.
"
38918,"MONICA & CHANDLER: Hey.
"
38919,"- Hey.
"
38920,"- Coffee.
"
38921,"And this from the Cry for Help Department:
"
38922,"Are you wearing makeup?
"
38923,"Yes, I am.
"
38924,"As of today, I am officially
"
38925,"Joey Tribbiani, actor/model.
"
38926,"Thank you.
"
38927,"That's funny, I was thinking you look more
"
38928,"like Joey Tribbiani, man/woman.
"
38929,"What were you modeling for?
"
38930,"You know those posters
"
38931,"for the City Free Clinic?
"
38932,"Oh, wow. You're gonna be one of those
"
38933,"healthy, healthy, healthy guys?
"
38934,"- Ah?
"
38935,"- The asthma guy's really cute.
"
38936,"- Oh, he is.
"
38937,"RACHEL: Isn't he?
"
38938,"- You know which one you're gonna be?
"
38939,"- No, no.
"
38940,"But I hear Lyme disease is open,
"
38941,"so, you know...
"
38942,"Good luck, man. I hope you get it.
"
38943,"Thanks.
"
38944,"Well, you were right.
"
38945,"How can they do this to us, huh?
"
38946,"It's Thanksgiving.
"
38947,"Aw. Tell you what.
"
38948,"How about if I cook dinner at my place?
"
38949,"I'll make it just like Mom's.
"
38950,"Will you make the mashed potatoes
"
38951,"with the lumps?
"
38952,"You know they're not actually
"
38953,"supposed to...?
"
38954,"I'll work on the lumps.
"
38955,"- Joey, you're going home, right?
"
38956,"- Yeah.
"
38957,"And I assume, Chandler, you're still
"
38958,"boycotting all the Pilgrim holidays?
"
38959,"Yes, every single one of them.
"
38960,"Phoebe, you're gonna be
"
38961,"with your grandma?
"
38962,"Yeah, and her boyfriend.
"
38963,"But we're celebrating Thanksgiving
"
38964,"in December because he's lunar.
"
38965,"So you're free Thursday, then?
"
38966,"- Yeah. Oh, can I come?
"
38967,"- Yeah.
"
38968,"Rach, you still thinking
"
38969,"you're gonna make it to Vail?
"
38970,"Absolutely. Shoop, shoop, shoop.
"
38971,"- Only $102 to go.
"
38972,"- I thought it was 98.50.
"
38973,"Yeah, well, it was, but I broke a cup.
"
38974,"Well, I'm off to Carol's.
"
38975,"Ooh, ooh, why don't we invite her?
"
38976,"Ooh, ooh, because she's my ex-wife...
"
38977,"...and will probably wanna
"
38978,"bring her, ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner.
"
38979,"[SUSAN CHUCKLES]
"
38980,"Hi. Is Carol here?
"
38981,"- No, she's at a faculty meeting.
"
38982,"- Oh.
"
38983,"Well, I just came by to pick up my skull.
"
38984,"Well, not mine, but...
"
38985,"- Come in.
"
38986,"- Thanks.
"
38987,"Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class,
"
38988,"and I have to get it back to the museum.
"
38989,"What's it look like?
"
38990,"Kind of like a big face without skin.
"
38991,"Yes, heh, I'm familiar with the concept.
"
38992,"- We can just look for it.
"
38993,"- Okay.
"
38994,"Wow, you guys, heh, sure have a lot
"
38995,"of books about being a lesbian.
"
38996,"Well, you know,
"
38997,"you have to take a course.
"
38998,"Otherwise they don't let you do it.
"
38999,"Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle. A classic.
"
39000,"Actually, I'm reading it to the baby.
"
39001,"[CHUCKLES]
"
39002,"The baby that hasn't been born yet?
"
39003,"Uh, wouldn't that mean you're...
"
39004,"...crazy?
"
39005,"What, you don't think
"
39006,"they can hear sounds in there?
"
39007,"You're not serious.
"
39008,"I mean, you really talk to it?
"
39009,"Yeah, all the time.
"
39010,"I want the baby to know my voice.
"
39011,"Do you, uh...? Do you talk about me?
"
39012,"- Yeah, yeah. All the time.
"
39013,"- Really?
"
39014,"But, um, we just refer to you as
"
39015,"""Bobo the sperm guy.""
"
39016,"Look, if she's talking to it, I just think
"
39017,"I should get some belly time too.
"
39018,"I mean, not that I believe any of this.
"
39019,"Oh, I believe it.
"
39020,"I think the baby can totally hear everything.
"
39021,"- Really?
"
39022,"- I can show you.
"
39023,"This will seem a little weird.
"
39024,"But you put your head
"
39025,"inside this turkey...
"
39026,"...and then we'll all talk,
"
39027,"and you'll hear everything we say.
"
39028,"I'd just like to say
"
39029,"I'm totally behind this experiment.
"
39030,"In fact,
"
39031,"I'd very much like to butter your head.
"
39032,"ROSS: Hey.
"
39033,"MONICA: Hey, Rach.
"
39034,"- Did you make your money?
"
39035,"RACHEL: No, not even close.
"
39036,"Forget Vail. Forget seeing my family.
"
39037,"Forget shoop, shoop, shoop.
"
39038,"Uh, Rach...
"
39039,"...here's your mail.
"
39040,"Thanks. You can just put it on the table.
"
39041,"Heh. No.
"
39042,"Here's your mail.
"
39043,"Thanks. You can just put it on the table.
"
39044,"Would you just open it?
"
39045,"Oh, my God.
"
39046,"- Oh, you guys are great.
"
39047,"- Aw. Ha, ha.
"
39048,"RACHEL: Aw.
"
39049,"- We all chipped in.
"
39050,"- We did?
"
39051,"- You owe me 20 bucks.
"
39052,"Thank you. Thank you so much.
"
39053,"Chandler, here you go.
"
39054,"Got your traditional holiday feast.
"
39055,"Got your tomato soup...
"
39056,"...your grilled-cheese fixings,
"
39057,"and your family-size bag of Funyuns.
"
39058,"Wait, this is what you're having
"
39059,"for Thanksgiving dinner?
"
39060,"What is it with you and this holiday?
"
39061,"[SIGHS]
"
39062,"All right, I'm 9 years old.
"
39063,"- Aw.
"
39064,"- Aw, I hate this story.
"
39065,"We've just finished Thanksgiving dinner.
"
39066,"I have... And I remember this part vividly.
"
39067,"- A mouthful of pumpkin pie.
"
39068,"And this is the moment my parents
"
39069,"choose to tell me they're getting divorced.
"
39070,"Oh, my God.
"
39071,"It's very difficult to enjoy Thanksgiving
"
39072,"dinner once you've seen it in reverse.
"
39073,"Hi.
"
39074,"- We used to work together.
"
39075,"- We did?
"
39076,"Yeah, at Macy's.
"
39077,"You're the Obsession girl, right?
"
39078,"- Yes.
"
39079,"- I was the Aramis guy.
"
39080,"- Aramis? Aramis? Aramis?
"
39081,"- Oh.
"
39082,"Yeah, right.
"
39083,"I gotta tell you,
"
39084,"you're the best in the business.
"
39085,"- Get out.
"
39086,"JOEY: I'm serious.
"
39087,"You're amazing. You know when to spritz.
"
39088,"You know when to lay back.
"
39089,"Really?
"
39090,"You don't know what that means to me.
"
39091,"[CHUCKLES]
"
39092,"Mm, mm.
"
39093,"You smell great tonight.
"
39094,"Uh, what are you wearing?
"
39095,"Nothing.
"
39096,"[BOTH CHUCKLE]
"
39097,"Listen, do you wanna go get a drink
"
39098,"or something?
"
39099,"Yeah, that would be...
"
39100,"- What's wrong?
"
39101,"- I just remembered I have to do something.
"
39102,"Oh. What?
"
39103,"Um...
"
39104,"Leave.
"
39105,"JOEY:
"
39106,"Whoa. Wait, wait, wait.
"
39107,"[GASPS]
"
39108,"[ALL LAUGHING]
"
39109,"[ROSS CLEARS THROAT]
"
39110,"[CHANDLER CLEARS THROAT]
"
39111,"So I guess you all saw it.
"
39112,"- What?
"
39113,"- Saw what?
"
39114,"No, we're just laughing.
"
39115,"You know how laughter can be infectious.
"
39116,"[ALL LAUGHING]
"
39117,"Hey.
"
39118,"Set another place for Thanksgiving.
"
39119,"My entire family thinks I have VD.
"
39120,"Tonight, on a very special Blossom.
"
39121,"MONICA:
"
39122,"Mm, looking good. Okay.
"
39123,"Cider's mulling, turkey's turking,
"
39124,"yams are yamming.
"
39125,"What?
"
39126,"I don't know.
"
39127,"It's just not the same
"
39128,"without Mom in the kitchen.
"
39129,"Ugh. All right, that's it.
"
39130,"Get out of my way and stop annoying me.
"
39131,"Well, that's closer. That's...
"
39132,"I got the ticket, I got the ticket.
"
39133,"Five hours from now,
"
39134,"shoop, shoop, shoop.
"
39135,"Oh, you must stop shooping.
"
39136,"Okay, I'm gonna get my stuff.
"
39137,"Chandler, will you just come in, already?
"
39138,"No, thank you. I prefer to keep
"
39139,"a safe distance from all this merriment.
"
39140,"Look out. Incoming pumpkin pie.
"
39141,"[MIMICS PLANE ZOOMING]
"
39142,"Okay, we all laughed when you did it with
"
39143,"the stuffing, but that's not funny anymore.
"
39144,"Hey, Monica, I got a question.
"
39145,"I don't see any Tater Tots.
"
39146,"That's not a question.
"
39147,"But my mom always makes them.
"
39148,"It's like a tradition.
"
39149,"You get a little piece of turkey on your fork,
"
39150,"a little cranberry sauce, and a Tot.
"
39151,"I mean, it's bad enough
"
39152,"I can't be with my family...
"
39153,"...because of my disease.
"
39154,"All right, fine.
"
39155,"Tonight's potatoes
"
39156,"will be both mashed with lumps...
"
39157,"...and in the form of Tots.
"
39158,"Yes.
"
39159,"All right,
"
39160,"I'm off to talk to my unborn child.
"
39161,"- Ah.
"
39162,"- Okay, Mom never hit.
"
39163,"[MIXER WHIRRING]
"
39164,"PHOEBE:
"
39165,"Okay, all done.
"
39166,"What? Phoebe, did you whip the pota...?
"
39167,"Ross needs lumps.
"
39168,"Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, I just...
"
39169,"I thought we could have them whipped
"
39170,"and then add some peas and onions.
"
39171,"Why would we do that?
"
39172,"Then they'd be just like
"
39173,"my mom used to make it...
"
39174,"...you know, before she died.
"
39175,"Okay, three kinds of potatoes coming up.
"
39176,"Okay. Goodbye, you guys.
"
39177,"Thanks for everything.
"
39178,"Oh, God, look at... Sorry. I'm so sorry.
"
39179,"The most unbelievable thing has happened.
"
39180,"Underdog has gotten away.
"
39181,"- The balloon?
"
39182,"- No, no, the actual cartoon character.
"
39183,"Of course the balloon.
"
39184,"It's all over the news.
"
39185,"Before he reached Macy's...
"
39186,"...he broke free and was spotted
"
39187,"flying over Washington Square Park.
"
39188,"- I'm going to the roof. Who's with me?
"
39189,"- Well, I can't. I gotta go.
"
39190,"An 80-foot inflatable dog
"
39191,"loose over the city?
"
39192,"- How often does that happen?
"
39193,"- Almost never.
"
39194,"- Got the keys?
"
39195,"- Okay.
"
39196,"Any time you're ready.
"
39197,"Okay.
"
39198,"Okay, here we go.
"
39199,"Oh...
"
39200,"Okay, where am I talking to here?
"
39201,"I mean, uh...
"
39202,"Well, there is one way that seems to offer
"
39203,"a certain acoustical advantage, but...
"
39204,"Just aim for the bump.
"
39205,"Okay.
"
39206,"Okay, okay.
"
39207,"Okay, here goes.
"
39208,"You know, I... You know, I can't do this.
"
39209,"This is... It's too weird. I feel stupid.
"
39210,"All right, so don't do it. It's fine.
"
39211,"You don't have to do it
"
39212,"just because Susan does it.
"
39213,"Hello, baby. Hello, hello.
"
39214,"- That moment when we first saw
"
39215,"the giant dog shadow fall over the park?
"
39216,"But did they have to shoot him down?
"
39217,"I mean, that was just mean.
"
39218,"Okay, right about now the turkey
"
39219,"should be crispy on the outside...
"
39220,"...and juicy on the inside.
"
39221,"Why are we standing here?
"
39222,"We're waiting for you to open the door.
"
39223,"You've got the keys.
"
39224,"No, I don't.
"
39225,"Yes, you do.
"
39226,"When we left, you said, ""Got the keys.""
"
39227,"No, I didn't. I asked, ""Got the keys?""
"
39228,"No, no, no. You said, ""Got the keys.""
"
39229,"Either of you have the keys?
"
39230,"- The oven is on.
"
39231,"- Oh, I've gotta get my ticket.
"
39232,"- Wait. We have a copy of your key.
"
39233,"- Well, then get it, get it!
"
39234,"Hey, hey.
"
39235,"That tone won't make me go any faster.
"
39236,"- Joey.
"
39237,"- That one will.
"
39238,"ROSS:
"
39239,"And everyone's telling me:
"
39240,"""You gotta pick a major.
"
39241,"You gotta pick a major.""
"
39242,"So on a dare, I picked paleontology.
"
39243,"And you have no idea what I'm saying,
"
39244,"because, let's face it, you're a fetus.
"
39245,"You're just happy
"
39246,"you don't have gills anymore.
"
39247,"Look, you don't have to talk to it.
"
39248,"You can sing to it.
"
39249,"Oh, please.
"
39250,"I am not singing to your stomach, okay?
"
39251,"- How's it going?
"
39252,"ROSS: Shh, shh, shh.
"
39253,"[SINGING]
"
39254,"Here we come
"
39255,"Walkin' down the street
"
39256,"Get the funniest looks from
"
39257,"Everyone we meet
"
39258,"Hey, hey...
"
39259,"- Hey, uh, did you just feel that?
"
39260,"- I did.
"
39261,"- Well, does it always, uh...?
"
39262,"- No, no, that was the first.
"
39263,"- Keep singing. Keep singing.
"
39264,"ROSS: Oh.
"
39265,"[SINGING]
"
39266,"Hey, hey, you're my baby
"
39267,"And I can't wait to meet you
"
39268,"When you come out I'll buy you a bagel
"
39269,"And then we'll go to the zoo
"
39270,"[CAROL & SUSAN SHRIEK]
"
39271,"I felt it that time.
"
39272,"Hey, hey, I'm your daddy
"
39273,"I'm the one without any breasts
"
39274,"- Nope, not that one.
"
39275,"- Can you go any faster with that?
"
39276,"Hey, I got one keyhole
"
39277,"and about a zillion keys.
"
39278,"You do the math.
"
39279,"Why do you guys have so many keys
"
39280,"in there anyway?
"
39281,"For an emergency just like this.
"
39282,"All right, listen, smirky.
"
39283,"If it wasn't for your stupid balloon...
"
39284,"...I would be on a plane,
"
39285,"watching a woman do this right now.
"
39286,"But I'm not.
"
39287,"I swear you said you had the keys.
"
39288,"No. I wouldn't say I had the keys
"
39289,"unless I had the keys.
"
39290,"And I obviously did not have the keys.
"
39291,"Okay, all right, that's it.
"
39292,"Enough with the keys. No one say ""keys.""
"
39293,"Why would I have the keys?
"
39294,"Aside from the fact
"
39295,"that you said you did?
"
39296,"- But I didn't.
"
39297,"- Well, you should have.
"
39298,"MONICA: Why?
"
39299,"RACHEL: Because.
"
39300,"Why? Because everything
"
39301,"is my responsibility?
"
39302,"Isn't it enough
"
39303,"that I'm making Thanksgiving dinner?
"
39304,"Everyone wants a different kind of potato,
"
39305,"so I'm making different kinds of potatoes.
"
39306,"You know, does anybody care
"
39307,"what kind of potatoes I want?
"
39308,"No, no, no!
"
39309,"You know, just as long as Phoebe
"
39310,"gets her peas and onions...
"
39311,"...and Mario gets his Tots.
"
39312,"[SOBBING IN HIGH VOICE]
"
39313,"It's my first Thanksgiving, and I...
"
39314,"It's all burnt, and I can't...
"
39315,"[SOBS]
"
39316,"Okay, Monica,
"
39317,"only dogs can hear you now, so...
"
39318,"Look, the door's open. Here we go.
"
39319,"Oh, God.
"
39320,"- Ooh.
"
39321,"- Oh.
"
39322,"Well, the turkey's burnt.
"
39323,"Potatoes are ruined.
"
39324,"Potatoes are ruined. Potatoes are ruined.
"
39325,"[SINGING]
"
39326,"Here we come
"
39327,"Walkin' down the...
"
39328,"[ROSS HUMS]
"
39329,"This doesn't smell like Mom's.
"
39330,"No, it doesn't, does it?
"
39331,"But you wanted lumps, Ross?
"
39332,"Well, here you go, buddy. You got one.
"
39333,"Oh, God, this is great.
"
39334,"The plane is gone,
"
39335,"so I guess I'm stuck here with you guys.
"
39336,"Hey, we all had better plans, okay?
"
39337,"This was nobody's first choice.
"
39338,"Oh, really?
"
39339,"So why was I busting my ass...
"
39340,"...to make this delicious
"
39341,"Thanksgiving dinner?!
"
39342,"- You call that delicious?
"
39343,"- You be quiet!
"
39344,"[ALL SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY]
"
39345,"All right, stop it, stop it, stop it!

39346,"Now, this feels like Thanksgiving.
"
39347,"PHOEBE: Ew.
"
39348,"- What?
"
39349,"PHOEBE: Ugly Naked Guy's
"
39350,"taking his turkey out of the oven.
"
39351,"JOEY, ROSS & MONICA:
"
39352,"Eh.
"
39353,"PHOEBE:
"
39354,"Oh, my God. He's not alone.
"
39355,"Ugly Naked Guy...
"
39356,"...is having Thanksgiving dinner
"
39357,"with Ugly Naked Gal.
"
39358,"JOEY:
"
39359,"I gotta see this.
"
39360,"ALL:
"
39361,"Aw.
"
39362,"All right, Ugly Naked Guy.
"
39363,"Ooh, ugly naked dancing.
"
39364,"It's nice that he has someone.
"
39365,"Shall I carve?
"
39366,"By all means.
"
39367,"CHANDLER:
"
39368,"All right.
"
39369,"Okay, who wants light cheese
"
39370,"and who wants dark cheese?
"
39371,"I don't even wanna know
"
39372,"about the dark cheese.
"
39373,"- Does anybody wanna split this with me?
"
39374,"- Ooh, I will.
"
39375,"Mm. You guys have to make a wish.
"
39376,"- Make a wish?
"
39377,"- Come on, you know, Thanksgiving.
"
39378,"Ooh. You got the bigger half.
"
39379,"What did you wish for?
"
39380,"The bigger half.
"
39381,"All right, I'd like to propose a toast.
"
39382,"- A little toast here. Ding, ding, ding.
"
39383,"ALL: Mm.
"
39384,"This isn't exactly
"
39385,"the kind of Thanksgiving you planned...
"
39386,"...but for me this has been really great,
"
39387,"you know?
"
39388,"I think because it didn't involve divorce...
"
39389,"...or projectile vomiting.
"
39390,"I was just thinking,
"
39391,"if you'd gone to Vail...
"
39392,"...or if you guys had been with your family,
"
39393,"or if you didn't have...
"
39394,"...syphilis and stuff...
"
39395,"...we wouldn't be all together, you know?
"
39396,"So I guess what I'm trying to say...
"
39397,"...is that I'm very thankful
"
39398,"that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.
"
39399,"RACHEL & JOEY:
"
39400,"That's so sweet.

"
39410,"I'd like you to meet.
"
39411,"[PHOEBE & RACHEL GASP]
"
39412,"Wait, wait. What is that?
"
39413,"That would be Marcel. You wanna say hi?
"
39414,"No. No, I don't.
"
39415,"Oh, he is precious.
"
39416,"Where did you get him?
"
39417,"My friend Bethel rescued him
"
39418,"from some lab.
"
39419,"That is so cruel.
"
39420,"Why? Why would a parent
"
39421,"name their child Bethel?
"
39422,"Hey, that monkey's got a Ross
"
39423,"on his ass.
"
39424,"Ross, is he gonna live with you,
"
39425,"like, in your apartment?
"
39426,"Yeah. I mean, it's been kind of quiet
"
39427,"since Carol left, so...
"
39428,"Why don't you just get a roommate?
"
39429,"Ah, I don't know.
"
39430,"You reach a certain age...
"
39431,"...having a roommate
"
39432,"is just kind of pathe...
"
39433,"Uh, sorry, that's ""pathet,"" which is Sanskrit
"
39434,"for ""really cool way to live.""
"
39435,"You guys,
"
39436,"I'm doing all-new material tonight.
"
39437,"I have 12 new songs
"
39438,"about my mother's suicide...
"
39439,"...and one about a snowman.
"

39443,"ROSS: Hey, Joe.
"

"
39445,"Ah, I didn't get the job.
"
39446,"[GROUP GROANS]
"
39447,"How could you not get it?
"
39448,"You were Santa last year.
"
39449,"I don't know. Some fat guy's
"
39450,"sleeping with the store manager.
"
39451,"He's not even jolly. It's all political.
"
39452,"So, what are you gonna be?
"
39453,"I'm gonna be one of his helpers.
"
39454,"It's just such a slap in the face,
"
39455,"you know?
"
39456,"Do you guys know what you're doing
"
39457,"for New Year's?
"
39458,"[GROUP SHOUTING]
"
39459,"Gee, what?
"
39460,"What is wrong with New Year's?
"
39461,"Nothing for you. You have Paolo.
"
39462,"You don't have to face
"
39463,"the horrible pressures of this holiday...
"
39464,"...desperate scramble
"
39465,"to find anything with lips...
"
39466,"...just so can have somebody to kiss
"
39467,"when the ball drops. Man, I'm talking loud.
"
39468,"Well, for your information, Paolo's
"
39469,"gonna be in Rome this New Year's.
"
39470,"So I'll be just as pathetic
"
39471,"as the rest of you.
"
39472,"Yeah, you wish.
"
39473,"It's just that I'm sick of being a victim
"
39474,"of this Dick Clark holiday.
"
39475,"I say this year, no dates, we make a pact.
"
39476,"Just the six of us. Dinner.
"
39477,"- Sure.
"
39478,"- Fine.
"
39479,"You know, I was hoping
"
39480,"for a little more enthusiasm.
"
39481,"- Woo!
"
39482,"- Okay.
"
39483,"- Phoebe, you're on.
"
39484,"- Oh. Oh, good.
"
39485,"Okay, hi. Ladies and gentlemen,
"
39486,"back by popular demand...
"
39487,"...Miss Phoebe Buffay.
"
39488,"[CROWD CHEERING]
"
39489,"Thanks. Hi.
"
39490,"Um, ahem, I want to start with a song
"
39491,"that means a lot to me this time of year.
"
39492,"[SINGING]
"
39493,"I made a man with eyes of coal
"
39494,"And a smile so bewitchin'
"
39495,"How was I supposed to know
"
39496,"That my mom was dead in the kitchen?
"
39497,"La-la-la
"
39498,"My mother's ashes
"
39499,"Even her eyelashes
"
39500,"Are resting in a little yellow jar
"
39501,"- And sometimes when it's freezing
"
39502,"DAVID: I'm being honest here.
"
39503,"You don't agree.
"
39504,"- I feel a little sneezy
"
39505,"MAX: You're right.
"
39506,"And now I...
"
39507,"Excuse me? Excuse me?
"
39508,"Yeah, noisy boys.
"
39509,"Is it something that you'd like
"
39510,"to share with the group?
"
39511,"No. No, that's okay.
"
39512,"Come on, if it's important enough
"
39513,"to discuss while I'm playing...
"
39514,"...then I assume it's important enough
"
39515,"for everyone else to hear.
"
39516,"That guy's going home with a note.
"
39517,"[CLEARS THROAT]
"
39518,"- Nothing. I was just saying...
"
39519,"- Could you speak up?
"
39520,"Sorry.
"
39521,"I was just saying to my friend, you were
"
39522,"the most beautiful woman I'd ever seen.
"
39523,"- And you said Daryl Hannah...
"
39524,"- Darryl Hannah.
"
39525,"...was the most beautiful woman
"
39526,"that he'd ever seen in his life.
"
39527,"And I said, yeah, I liked her in Splash,
"
39528,"but not so much in Wall Street.
"
39529,"- I thought she had a hard quality.
"
39530,"- A hard quality.
"
39531,"And, uh, while Daryl Hannah is beautiful
"
39532,"in a conventional way...
"
39533,"...you are, uh, luminous
"
39534,"with a kind of delicate grace.
"
39535,"Then that's when you started yelling.
"
39536,"Okay, we're gonna take a short break.
"
39537,"I think that guy's going home
"
39538,"with more than a note.
"
39539,"ROSS:
"
39540,"Come here, Marcel. Sit here.
"
39541,"[MARCEL CHATTERING]
"
39542,"Pheebs, I can't believe
"
39543,"he hasn't kissed you yet.
"
39544,"I mean, God, by my sixth date
"
39545,"with Paolo...
"
39546,"...I mean, he had already named
"
39547,"both my breasts.
"
39548,"Ooh, did I just share too much?
"
39549,"Just a smidge.
"
39550,"David's, like, you know, a scientist guy.
"
39551,"He's very methodical.
"
39552,"- I think it's romantic.
"
39553,"- Me too. Oh!
"
39554,"Did you ever see
"
39555,"An Officer and a Gentleman?
"
39556,"MONICA:
"
39557,"Yeah.
"
39558,"Well, he's kind of like the guy
"
39559,"I went to see that with.
"
39560,"[INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE]
"
39561,"Except...
"
39562,"Except he's smarter and gentler
"
39563,"and sweeter.
"
39564,"I just... I just want to be with him
"
39565,"all the time.
"
39566,"You know, day and night.
"
39567,"And night and day.
"
39568,"And special occasions.
"
39569,"Wait a minute. I see where this is going.
"
39570,"You're gonna ask him to New Year's.
"
39571,"You're gonna break the pact.
"
39572,"She's gonna break the pact.
"
39573,"No, no, no.
"
39574,"Yeah, could I just?
"
39575,"- Yeah, because I already asked Janice.
"
39576,"RACHEL: You what?
"
39577,"Come on, this was a pact.
"
39578,"This was your pact.
"
39579,"I snapped, okay? I couldn't handle
"
39580,"the pressure and I snapped.
"
39581,"Yeah, but Janice?
"
39582,"That was, like, the worst breakup in history.
"
39583,"I'm not saying it was a good idea.
"
39584,"I'm saying I snapped.
"
39585,"Hi. Hi, sorry I'm late.
"
39586,"Too many jokes.
"
39587,"Must mock Joey.
"
39588,"Nice shoes, huh?
"
39589,"Aah, you're killing me.
"
39590,"Ross.
"
39591,"He's playing with my spatulas again.
"
39592,"Look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?
"
39593,"Do you always have to bring him here?
"
39594,"Look, I didn't want to leave him alone,
"
39595,"all right?
"
39596,"We had our first fight this morning.
"
39597,"I think it has to do with my working late.
"
39598,"I said some things that I didn't mean.
"
39599,"He threw some feces.
"
39600,"You know, if you're gonna work late,
"
39601,"I can look in on him for you.
"
39602,"Oh, that would be great. Okay.
"
39603,"But if you do, make sure it seems
"
39604,"like you're there to see him, okay?
"
39605,"And you're not, like, doing it
"
39606,"as a favor to me.
"
39607,"Okay. But if he asks, I'm not going to lie.
"
39608,"But you can't actually test this theory.
"
39609,"Because today's particle accelerators
"
39610,"are nowhere near powerful enough...
"
39611,"...to simulate these conditions.
"
39612,"- Okay. All right. I have a question then.
"
39613,"- Yeah.
"
39614,"Were you planning on kissing me ever?
"
39615,"Uh, that's definitely a valid question...
"
39616,"...and, uh, the answer...
"
39617,"...would be yes.
"
39618,"Yes, I was.
"
39619,"But see, I wanted it to be
"
39620,"this phenomenal kiss...
"
39621,"...that happened at this phenomenal
"
39622,"moment because, well, it's you.
"
39623,"Sure. Yeah.
"
39624,"Right. But, see, the longer I waited,
"
39625,"the more phenomenal the kiss had to be.
"
39626,"And now, we've reached a place...
"
39627,"...where it's just got to be
"
39628,"one of those things where I...
"
39629,"...sweep everything off the table
"
39630,"and throw you down on it.
"
39631,"And I'm not really
"
39632,"a sweeping sort of fella.
"
39633,"Oh, David, I think you are
"
39634,"a sweeping sort of fella.
"
39635,"I mean, you're a sweeper
"
39636,"trapped inside a physicist's body.
"
39637,"- Really.
"
39638,"- Oh, yeah. I'm sure of it.
"
39639,"You should just do it.
"
39640,"Just sweep and throw me. Heh.
"
39641,"- Now? Now?
"
39642,"- Right now. Just...
"

39655,"Look, I'm sorry, okay?
"
39656,"It's just that Chandler has somebody
"
39657,"and Phoebe has somebody.
"
39658,"I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby.
"
39659,"- Fun Bobby, your ex-boyfriend, Fun Bobby?
"
39660,"- Yeah.
"
39661,"You know more than one Fun Bobby?

"
39683,"Hey, you know,
"
39684,"this is so not what I needed now.
"
39685,"- What's the matter?
"
39686,"- Oh, it's Marcel.
"
39687,"He keeps shutting me out, you know?
"
39688,"He's walking around all the time,
"
39689,"dragging his hands.
"
39690,"That's so weird. I had such a blast
"
39691,"with him the other night.
"
39692,"- Really?
"
39693,"- Yeah, we played. We watched TV.
"
39694,"That juggling thing is amazing.
"
39695,"What, uh?
"
39696,"What juggling thing?
"
39697,"With the balled-up socks?
"
39698,"I figured you taught him that.
"
39699,"No.
"
39700,"You know, it wasn't that big a deal.
"
39701,"I mean, just balled-up socks.

"

"
40073,"But I get to see my son, who I love.

"
40076,"This is the way that I find out.
"
40077,"Most moms use the phone.
"
40078,"You know, don't take this wrong,
"
40079,"I just don't see you as a mom somehow.
"
40080,"- I don't mean that bad.
"
40081,"- Oh, no. I'm a fabulous mom.
"
40082,"I bought my son his first condoms.

"
40203,"Yeah, well, you don't have your racquet.
"
40204,"No. No, I don't,
"
40205,"because it's being restrung.

40207,"to bring me one.

"
40260,"...without me?
"

"
40858,"I've ever seen.
"
40859,"I know.

"

"
40887,"No, I'm sorry.
"

"

"
40897,"- Yes, good. Okay.

"

"

"
40901,"Because...
"
40902,"...he's gorgeous.
"
40903,"And he's charming.
"
40904,"- And when he looks at you...
"
40905,"- Okay. Okay, Pheebs.
"
40906,"The end.
"

"
40910,"it's much better that I know.
"
40911,"Uh, I just liked it better before.
"
40912,"It was better.
"

40921,"Yes.
"
40922,"Come on, Pheebs.
"
40923,"Whoo.
"
40924,"Well, it looks like, uh,
"
40925,"we kicked your butts.
"
40926,"No, no. She kicked our butts.
"
40927,"You could be on the Olympic
"
40928,"""Standing There"" team.
"
40929,"Come on. Two on one.
"
40930,"What are you still doing here?
"
40931,"She just broke up with the guy.
"
40932,"It's time for you to swoop in.
"
40933,"What? Now?
"
40934,"Yes. Now is when you swoop.
"
40935,"You gotta make sure
"
40936,"that when Paolo walks out...
"
40937,"...the first guy Rachel sees is you.
"
40938,"She's got to know
"
40939,"that you're everything he's not.
"
40940,"You're like... Like the anti-Paolo.
"
40941,"My Catholic friend is right.
"
40942,"She's distraught. You're there for her.
"
40943,"You pick up the pieces,
"
40944,"and then you usher in:
"
40945,"The Age of Ross.
"
40946,"[PAOLO SPEAKING IN ITALIAN]
"
40947,"RACHEL:
"
40948,"See this? See?
"
40949,"[SPEAKING IN ITALIAN]
"
40950,"- How's it going?
"
40951,"MONICA: Don't stare.
"
40952,"She just finished throwing
"
40953,"his clothes off the balcony.
"
40954,"Now there's just a lot of gesturing
"
40955,"and arm-waving.
"
40956,"Okay, that is either, ""How could you?""
"
40957,"Or ""Enormous breasts.""
"
40958,"Here he comes.
"
40959,"Uh, I am, uh...
"
40960,"...to say goodbye.
"
40961,"Oh, okay, bye-bye.
"
40962,"Paolo.
"
40963,"I really hate you for what you did to Rachel.
"
40964,"But I still have five of these...
"
40965,"...so heat it at 375
"
40966,"until the cheese bubbles.
"
40967,"[SPEAKING IN ITALIAN]
"
40968,"Paolo, I just wanna tell you...
"
40969,"...and I think I'd speak
"
40970,"for everyone when I say...
"
40971,"PHOEBE:
"
40972,"Oh. Just look at her.
"
40973,"Oh, you guys, I really think only one of us
"
40974,"should go out there...
"
40975,"...so she's not overwhelmed.
"
40976,"- Oh, right.
"
40977,"And I really think it should be me.
"
40978,"BOTH:
"
40979,"Hey.
"
40980,"You all right?
"
40981,"Oh. I've been better.
"
40982,"[SIGHS]
"
40983,"Come here.
"
40984,"Listen...
"
40985,"...you deserve so much better than him.
"
40986,"You know? I mean, you...
"
40987,"You should be with a guy who knows
"
40988,"what he has when he has you.
"
40989,"Ross...
"
40990,"What?
"
40991,"I'm so sick of guys.
"
40992,"I don't want to look at another guy.
"
40993,"I don't want to think about another guy.
"
40994,"I don't even want to be near another guy.
"
40995,"[RACHEL SIGHS]
"
40996,"Huh.
"
40997,"- Ross, you're so great.
"
40998,"- Oh, ha, ha.
"
40999,"MONICA: Are you all right?
"
41000,"PHOEBE: Are you okay?
"
41001,"Medium. Heh.
"
41002,"- Any cookies left?
"
41003,"- Yeah.
"
41004,"Heh. See, Rach, um...
"
41005,"See, I don't think swearing off guys
"
41006,"altogether is the answer. I really don't.
"
41007,"I think what you need is to develop a more
"
41008,"sophisticated screening process.
"
41009,"No. No. I just need
"
41010,"to be by myself for a while.
"
41011,"You know?
"
41012,"I just gotta figure out what I want.
"
41013,"No, no.
"
41014,"See, because not all guys out there
"
41015,"are gonna be a Paolo.
"
41016,"No, I know. I know.
"
41017,"And I'm sure your little boy's
"
41018,"not gonna grow up to be one.
"
41019,"- What?
"
41020,"- What?
"
41021,"[STAMMERING]
"
41022,"I'm having a boy?
"
41023,"Uh, no.
"
41024,"No. In fact, you're not having a boy.
"
41025,"I'm having a boy.
"
41026,"[STAMMERING]
"
41027,"Am I having a boy?
"
41028,"- You're having a boy.
"
41029,"- Aah!
"
41030,"- I'm having a boy. I'm having a boy.
"
41031,"- Yes!
"
41032,"- What?
"
41033,"- What is it?
"
41034,"I'm having a boy. I'm having a boy.
"
41035,"Hey.
"
41036,"[IN UNISON]
"
41037,"We already knew that.
"
41038,"I'm having a son.
"
41039,"Um...
"
41040,"Yes. And that would be a shutdown.
"
41041,"[IN UNISON]
"
41042,"Shutout!
"
41043,"Where you guys going?
"
41044,"Come on, one more game.
"
41045,"- Oh. It's 2:30 in the morning.
"
41046,"- Yeah. Get out.
"
41047,"You guys are always hanging out
"
41048,"in my apartment.
"
41049,"Come on, I'll only use my left hand,
"
41050,"huh?
"
41051,"Come on, wussies.
"
41052,"- All right. Okay. I gotta go.
"
41053,"- Mm-hm.
"
41054,"I'm going.
"
41055,"And I'm gone.
"

"

"
41060,"CHANDLER: I'm sorry.
"
41061,"RACHEL: Oh, my God. That's it.
"
41062,"You just barge in here
"
41063,"and you don't knock?
"
41064,"You have no respect
"
41065,"for anybody's privacy.
"
41066,"- Rachel, wait.
"
41067,"- No, you wait.
"
41068,"- Can I just say one thing?
"
41069,"- What? What?
"
41070,"That's a relatively open weave
"
41071,"and I can still see your...
"
41072,"...nippular area.
"
41073,"- Ugh!
"
41074,"Honey, honey, tell them the story
"
41075,"about your patient...
"
41076,"...who thinks things are
"
41077,"other things.
"
41078,"You know?
"
41079,"Like when the phone rings
"
41080,"and she takes a shower...
"
41081,"That's pretty much it.
"
41082,"But you tell it really well, sweetie.
"
41083,"Thanks. Okay.
"
41084,"Now go away so we can
"
41085,"talk about you.
"
41086,"Okay. I'll miss you.
"
41087,"Isn't he great?
"
41088,"He's so cute. And he
"
41089,"likes you so much.
"
41090,"I know. I know.
"
41091,"He's so sweet.
"
41092,"And so complicated, you know?
"
41093,"And for a shrink,
"
41094,"he's not too ""shrinky."" You know?
"
41095,"So you think you'll do it on his couch?
"
41096,"Oh. I don't know. That's a little weird.
"
41097,"It's vinyl.
"
41098,"- Okay. You guys want anything else?
"
41099,"- Oh, yes.
"
41100,"- Could I have...?
"
41101,"- Sorry, we're all out.
"
41102,"- Anybody else?
"
41103,"- Okay.
"
41104,"Did I, uh, miss something?
"
41105,"No, she's still upset
"
41106,"because I saw her boobies.
"
41107,"What were you doing
"
41108,"seeing her boobies?
"
41109,"It was an accident.
"
41110,"I wasn't across the street with
"
41111,"a telescope and a box of doughnuts.
"
41112,"[ROGER LAUGHS]
"
41113,"Can we change the subject, please?
"
41114,"Because, hello? These aren't her
"
41115,"""boobies."" These are her breasts.
"
41116,"Pheebs, I was hoping
"
41117,"for more of a change.
"
41118,"I don't know why you're embarrassed.
"
41119,"They were very nice boobies.
"
41120,"""Nice""?
"
41121,"They were ""nice""?
"
41122,"That's it?
"
41123,"I mean, mittens are ""nice.""
"
41124,"Okay. Rock, hard place...
"
41125,"...me.
"
41126,"[ROGER LAUGHING]
"
41127,"You're so funny.
"
41128,"He's really funny.
"
41129,"I wouldn't want to be there when
"
41130,"the laughter stops.
"
41131,"Whoa, whoa. Back up there, sparky.
"
41132,"What did you mean by that?
"
41133,"It seems that maybe
"
41134,"you have intimacy issues...
"
41135,"...that you use your humor
"
41136,"to keep people at a distance.
"
41137,"Huh.
"
41138,"I mean, hey, I just met you.
"
41139,"I don't know you from Adam.
"
41140,"Only child, right?
"
41141,"Parents divorced
"
41142,"before you hit puberty.
"
41143,"Uh-huh. How did you know?
"
41144,"It's textbook.
"
41145,"Hey, you guys.
"
41146,"You all know my dad, right?
"
41147,"- How long are you in the city?
"
41148,"- A couple of days.
"
41149,"I got a job midtown.
"
41150,"I figure I'm better off
"
41151,"staying with the kid...
"
41152,"...than hauling my ass back and forth
"
41153,"on the ferry.
"
41154,"I don't know this one.
"
41155,"- Oh. This is my friend Roger.
"
41156,"- Hi.
"
41157,"- Good to meet you.
"
41158,"ROGER: You too.
"
41159,"What happened to the, uh, puppet guy?
"
41160,"- Dad, uh...
"
41161,"- Oh, oh.
"
41162,"Excuse me.
"
41163,"So, Ross, uh, how's the wife?
"
41164,"[ROSS GROANS]
"
41165,"Oh for two, huh? Heh.
"
41166,"Uh, Chandler, quick,
"
41167,"say something funny.
"
41168,"Gotta go. Ha, ha.
"
41169,"I miss you too.
"
41170,"I love you,
"
41171,"but it's getting late now...
"
41172,"Let me say hi. Hey, Ma.
"
41173,"Listen, I made the appointment
"
41174,"with Dr. Bassida and...
"
41175,"Excuse me?
"
41176,"Did you know this isn't Ma?
"
41177,"Her name's Ronni.
"
41178,"She's a pet mortician.
"
41179,"Sure.
"
41180,"So how long have you been...
"
41181,"Remember when you were a kid,
"
41182,"I'd take you to the Navy yard...
"
41183,"...and show you the big ships?
"
41184,"- Since then?
"
41185,"- No, it's only been six years.
"
41186,"I wanted to give you
"
41187,"a nice memory...
"
41188,"...so you'd know I wasn't always
"
41189,"such a terrible guy.
"
41190,"Joe, have you ever been in love?
"
41191,"I don't know.
"
41192,"Then you haven't.
"
41193,"- You're burning your tomatoes.
"
41194,"- Hmm. You're one to talk.
"
41195,"Joe, your dad's in love, bigtime.
"
41196,"And the worst part is,
"
41197,"it's with two different women.
"
41198,"Oh, man. Please tell me
"
41199,"one of them is Ma.
"
41200,"Of course one of them's Ma.
"
41201,"What's the matter with you?
"
41202,"It's like if you woke up one day
"
41203,"and found out...
"
41204,"...your dad was
"
41205,"leading this double life.
"
41206,"He's, like, actually some spy
"
41207,"working for the CIA.
"
41208,"That'd be cool.
"
41209,"This blows.
"
41210,"I know. Why can't parents
"
41211,"just stay parents?
"
41212,"Why do they
"
41213,"have to become people?
"
41214,"Why do they have...?
"
41215,"Why...
"
41216,"...can't you stop staring
"
41217,"at my breasts?
"
41218,"What?
"
41219,"Didn't you get a good enough
"
41220,"look the other day?
"
41221,"All right, we're all adults here.
"
41222,"There's only one way
"
41223,"to resolve this.
"
41224,"Since you saw her boobies...
"
41225,"...I think, uh, you're gonna have to
"
41226,"show her your pee-pee.
"
41227,"You know,
"
41228,"I don't see that happening.
"
41229,"Come on. He's right.
"
41230,"Tit for tat.
"
41231,"Well I'm not showing you my tat.
"
41232,"[INTERCOM BUZZES]
"
41233,"Hello?
"
41234,"PHOEBE: It's Phoebe.
"
41235,"ROGER: And Rog.
"
41236,"Come on up.
"
41237,"Oh, good. Rog is here.
"
41238,"- What's the matter with Rog?
"
41239,"- Nothing. It's a little thing.
"
41240,"I hate that guy.
"
41241,"What? So he was a little analytical.
"
41242,"That's what he does.
"
41243,"Come on, he's not that bad.
"
41244,"That's where you're wrong.
"
41245,"Why would I marry her...
"
41246,"...if I thought on any level
"
41247,"that she was a lesbian?
"
41248,"I don't know.
"
41249,"Maybe you wanted
"
41250,"your marriage to fail.
"
41251,"- Ha, ha.
"
41252,"- Why? Why would I? Why?
"
41253,"Why? Why? Why?
"
41254,"I don't know.
"
41255,"Maybe low self-esteem?
"
41256,"Maybe to compensate
"
41257,"for overshadowing a sibling. Maybe...
"
41258,"Wait.
"
41259,"Go back to that ""sibling"" thing.
"
41260,"Well, I don't know.
"
41261,"It's conceivable that
"
41262,"you sabotaged your marriage...
"
41263,"...so the sibling would be less
"
41264,"of a failure in the parents' eyes.
"
41265,"[CHUCKLES]
"
41266,"That's ridiculous.
"
41267,"I don't feel guilty for her failures.
"
41268,"- Oh, so you think I'm a failure?
"
41269,"- Isn't he good?
"
41270,"Yeah. No.
"
41271,"That's not what I was saying.
"
41272,"All these years,
"
41273,"I thought you were on my side...
"
41274,"...but maybe you were
"
41275,"sucking up to Mom and Dad...
"
41276,"...so they'd favor you.
"
41277,"Hey, I married a lesbian
"
41278,"to make you look good.
"
41279,"You're right.
"
41280,"I mean, you're right.
"
41281,"It wasn't just the Weebles,
"
41282,"but it was the Weeble Play Palace...
"
41283,"...and the Weeble's Cruise Ship...
"
41284,"...which had this little lifeboat
"
41285,"for the Weebles to wobble in.
"
41286,"That's tough, tough stuff.
"
41287,"Pheebs, if we're gonna
"
41288,"catch that movie, we gotta go.
"
41289,"Okay. Feel better, okay?
"
41290,"ROGER: We're gonna be late, sweetie.
"
41291,"- Okay.
"
41292,"- Listen, thanks for everything, Mon.
"
41293,"- No problem.
"
41294,"It was great seeing you again.
"
41295,"[ROSS MUTTERS]
"
41296,"Mon, uh, easy on those cookies, okay?
"
41297,"Remember, they're just food...
"
41298,"...they're not love.
"
41299,"I hate that guy.
"
41300,"JOEY:
"
41301,"Good night, you guys.
"
41302,"Oh, look.
"
41303,"It's the woman we ordered.
"
41304,"Hey. Can, uh... Can we help you?
"
41305,"Oh. No, thanks. I'm just waiting
"
41306,"for, uh, Joey Tribbiani.
"
41307,"I'm Joey Tribbiani.
"
41308,"Oh. Oh, no, not you. Big Joey.
"
41309,"Oh, my God.
"
41310,"You're so much cuter than
"
41311,"your pictures.
"
41312,"I'm Ronni.
"
41313,"Cheese Nip?
"
41314,"Uh, Joey's having an embolism...
"
41315,"...but I'd go for a Nip.
"
41316,"You see, most people,
"
41317,"when their pets pass on...
"
41318,"...they want them laid out
"
41319,"like they're sleeping.
"
41320,"But occasionally you get a person
"
41321,"who wants them in a pose.
"
41322,"Like, uh, chasing their tail.
"
41323,"Or, uh, jumping to catch a Frisbee.
"
41324,"Joey, if I go first, I want to be
"
41325,"looking for my keys.
"
41326,"[RONNI LAUGHS]
"
41327,"- That's a good one.
"
41328,"- Hey, Joe.
"
41329,"Hey, Dad. Ronni's here.
"
41330,"- Huh?
"
41331,"- Hi.
"
41332,"- Hey.
"
41333,"RONNl: Hey.
"
41334,"Hello, babe.
"
41335,"What are...? What are you doing here?
"
41336,"Oh, uh, you left your hair
"
41337,"at my apartment.
"
41338,"I figured you'd need it
"
41339,"for your meeting.
"
41340,"Thank you. Uh...
"
41341,"So who's up for a big
"
41342,"game of Kerplunk?
"
41343,"Look, I, uh...
"
41344,"I shouldn't have come.
"
41345,"I gotta go.
"
41346,"I'll miss the last train.
"
41347,"No, I don't want you taking
"
41348,"that thing this late.
"
41349,"- Where am I gonna stay? Here?
"
41350,"- Whoa.
"
41351,"We'll go to a hotel.
"
41352,"- No, you won't.
"
41353,"- No, we won't.
"
41354,"If you go to a hotel,
"
41355,"you'll be doing stuff.
"
41356,"I want you right here,
"
41357,"where I can keep an eye on you.
"
41358,"You're gonna keep an eye on us?
"
41359,"That's right, mister.
"
41360,"I don't care how old you are,
"
41361,"while you're here...
"
41362,"...you're gonna live by my rules.
"
41363,"And that means no sleeping
"
41364,"with your girlfriend.
"
41365,"Wow, he's strict.
"
41366,"Dad, you'll be in my room.
"
41367,"Ronni, uh, you can stay in
"
41368,"Chandler's room.
"
41369,"Thanks.
"
41370,"You're a good kid.
"
41371,"Come on.
"
41372,"I'll show you to my room.
"
41373,"That sounds weird when it's not
"
41374,"followed by, ""No, thanks, it's late.""
"
41375,"Okay. This is just for tonight.
"
41376,"Starting tomorrow, you gotta change.
"
41377,"- Six years is long enough.
"
41378,"- What kind of change?
"
41379,"- Break up with Ronni...
"
41380,"- I can't.
"
41381,"Then come clean with Ma.
"
41382,"This is not right.
"
41383,"I don't wanna hear it.
"
41384,"Now go to my room.
"
41385,"Hey, kickie.
"
41386,"- What are you doing?
"
41387,"- Trying to get comfortable.
"
41388,"- I can't sleep in my underwear.
"
41389,"- Well, you're gonna.
"
41390,"I've been thinking...
"
41391,"...about how I'm always
"
41392,"seeing girls on top of girls.
"
41393,"Are they end-to-end,
"
41394,"or tall, like pancakes?
"
41395,"You know what I mean.
"
41396,"How I date all these women.
"
41397,"I always figured, when
"
41398,"the right one comes along...
"
41399,"...I'll be able to be a standup guy
"
41400,"and go the distance, you know?
"
41401,"Now I'm looking at my Dad thinking...
"
41402,"You're not him, you're you.
"
41403,"When they wanted you to go into
"
41404,"your father's business, did you cave?
"
41405,"- No.
"
41406,"- No.
"
41407,"You decided to go into
"
41408,"the out-of-work-actor business.
"
41409,"That wasn't easy, but you did it.
"
41410,"And I believe that
"
41411,"when the right woman comes along...
"
41412,"...you'll have the guts to say:
"
41413,"""No thanks, I'm married.""
"
41414,"You really think so?
"
41415,"Yeah. I really do.
"
41416,"- Thanks, Chandler.
"
41417,"- Get off.
"
41418,"[KNOCK ON DOOR]
"
41419,"- Hi.
"
41420,"- Hi.
"
41421,"May I help you?
"
41422,"Uh, Joey said I could use your shower
"
41423,"since, uh, Chandler's in ours.
"
41424,"Okay. Who are you?
"
41425,"- Oh, uh, I'm Ronni. Ronni Rapalono.
"
41426,"- Uh-huh.
"
41427,"The mistress?
"
41428,"- Um, come on in.
"
41429,"- Thanks.

41430,"Hi, I'm Rachel.

"
41432,"Hey, Ronni.
"
41433,"How long has Chandler been
"
41434,"in the shower?
"
41435,"Oh. Like, uh, five minutes.
"
41436,"Perfect.
"
41437,"Fasten your seat belts...
"
41438,"...it's pee-pee time.
"
41439,"Hey, Mr. Trib.
"
41440,"Hey. Good morning, dear.
"
41441,"Chandler Bing,
"
41442,"it's time to see your thing.
"
41443,"[RACHEL SHRIEKS]
"
41444,"- What's the matter with you?
"
41445,"- I thought it was Chandler.
"
41446,"You were supposed to be in there
"
41447,"so I could see your thing.
"
41448,"Sorry, my thing
"
41449,"was in there with me.

41451,"ALL: Hey, Pheebs.
"
41452,"MONICA: How's it going?
"
41453,"- Good. Oh, oh.
"
41454,"Roger's having a dinner thing
"
41455,"and he wanted me to invite you guys.
"
41456,"[CHANDLER CHUCKLES]
"
41457,"- So, what's going on?
"
41458,"- Nothing.
"
41459,"It's just that, uh...
"
41460,"It's Roger.
"
41461,"Um, ahem, I don't know.
"
41462,"There's something about... Ahem.
"
41463,"Basically, we just feel
"
41464,"that he's, uh...
"
41465,"We hate that guy.
"
41466,"MONICA:
"
41467,"We hate him.
"
41468,"We're sorry, Pheebs.
"
41469,"Uh-huh. Okay.
"
41470,"Don't you think maybe it's just that
"
41471,"he's so perceptive...
"
41472,"...that it freaked you out?
"
41473,"- No, I hate him.
"
41474,"- No, we hate him.
"
41475,"I'm sorry.
"
41476,"[KNOCK ON DOOR]
"
41477,"Ma. What are you doing here?
"
41478,"I came to give you this...
"
41479,"...and this.
"
41480,"- Ow.
"
41481,"Big ring.
"
41482,"Why did you fill your father's head
"
41483,"with that garbage...
"
41484,"...about making things right?
"
41485,"Things were fine the way they were.
"
41486,"There's chicken in there.
"
41487,"Put it away.
"
41488,"For God's sake, Joey.
"
41489,"Really.
"
41490,"Hold on. You knew?
"
41491,"Of course I knew.
"
41492,"What do you think?
"
41493,"Your father is no James Bond.
"
41494,"You should have heard
"
41495,"his cover stories.
"
41496,"""I'm sleeping over at
"
41497,"my accountant's.""
"
41498,"I mean, what is that?
"
41499,"Please.
"
41500,"So then, how could you...?
"
41501,"Do you remember
"
41502,"how your father used to be?
"
41503,"Always yelling.
"
41504,"Nothing made him happy.
"
41505,"Not that wood shop, not those
"
41506,"stupid little ships in the bottle.
"
41507,"Now he's happy.
"
41508,"I mean, it's nice.
"
41509,"He has a hobby.
"
41510,"Ma, I don't mean
"
41511,"to be disrespectful, but...
"
41512,"...what the hell
"
41513,"are you talking about?
"
41514,"- I mean, what about you?
"
41515,"- Me? I'm fine.
"
41516,"Look, honey...
"
41517,"...in an ideal world...
"
41518,"...there'd be no her and your father
"
41519,"would look like Sting.
"
41520,"And I'll tell you something else:
"
41521,"Ever since that
"
41522,"poodle-stuffer came along...
"
41523,"...he's been so ashamed of himself
"
41524,"that he's been more attentive.
"
41525,"He's been more loving.
"
41526,"It's like every day is
"
41527,"our anniversary.
"
41528,"I'm happy for you?
"
41529,"Well, don't be.
"
41530,"Because now everything's screwed up.
"
41531,"I just want it the way it was.
"
41532,"JOEY:
"
41533,"Ma, I'm sorry.
"
41534,"I just did what
"
41535,"I thought you'd want.
"
41536,"I know you did, cookie.
"
41537,"Oh, I know you did.
"
41538,"So tell me...
"
41539,"Did you see her?
"
41540,"Yeah.
"
41541,"You're 10 times prettier
"
41542,"than she is.
"
41543,"That's sweet.
"
41544,"Could I take her?
"
41545,"With this ring, no contest.
"
41546,"ROGER: What's wrong, sweetie?
"
41547,"PHOEBE: Nothing.
"
41548,"No, no. What's wrong? Come on.
"
41549,"Okay.
"
41550,"It's nothing. I'm fine.
"
41551,"It's just, um...
"
41552,"It's my friends.
"
41553,"They have a liking problem with you...
"
41554,"...in that, um...
"
41555,"...they don't.
"
41556,"Oh. They don't?
"
41557,"But you know...
"
41558,"...they don't see all
"
41559,"of the wonderfulness that I see.
"
41560,"They don't see all the good stuff
"
41561,"and all the sweet stuff.
"
41562,"They think you're a little...
"
41563,"- What?
"
41564,"- Intense and creepy.
"
41565,"Oh.
"
41566,"But I don't. Me. Phoebe.
"
41567,"Well, I'm not at all surprised
"
41568,"they feel that way.
"
41569,"You're not?
"
41570,"See, that's why you're so great.
"
41571,"Actually, it's
"
41572,"quite typical behavior...
"
41573,"...when you have this kind
"
41574,"of dysfunctional group dynamic.
"
41575,"You know, this kind of codependent...
"
41576,"...emotionally stunted...
"
41577,"...sitting in your stupid coffeehouse,
"
41578,"with your stupid big cups...
"
41579,"...which, I'm sorry, might as well
"
41580,"have nipples on them.
"
41581,"And you're all like,
"
41582,"""Oh, define me. Define me.
"
41583,"Love me. I need love.""
"
41584,"So you talked to your dad, huh?
"
41585,"Yeah. He's gonna keep cheating on Ma,
"
41586,"like she wanted.
"
41587,"Ma's gonna keep pretending
"
41588,"she doesn't know even though she does.
"
41589,"And my sister Tina
"
41590,"can't see her husband anymore...
"
41591,"...because he got
"
41592,"a restraining order.
"
41593,"Which has nothing to do with it,
"
41594,"except that I found out today.
"
41595,"Wow.
"
41596,"Things sure have changed here
"
41597,"on Walton's mountain.
"
41598,"So, Joey, are you okay?
"
41599,"Yeah, I guess.
"
41600,"It's just...
"
41601,"You know, they're parents.
"
41602,"After a certain point,
"
41603,"you gotta let go.
"
41604,"Even if you know better...
"
41605,"...you gotta let them make
"
41606,"their own mistakes.
"
41607,"And just think...
"
41608,"...in a couple years,
"
41609,"we get to turn into them.
"
41610,"Oh, please.
"
41611,"If I turn into my parents,
"
41612,"I'll either be an alcoholic blond...
"
41613,"...chasing after 20-year-old boys...
"
41614,"...or I'll end up like my mom.

"
41628,"...and he can be really sweet.
"
41629,"And in some ways,
"
41630,"I think he is so right for me.
"

"

"
41675,"No. Pheebs. Don't you remember
"
41676,"why you dumped the guy?
"
41677,"Because he was creepy.
"

"
41692,"- No, no, don't you dare bail on me.

"

41797,"Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters?
"
41798,"By the way, Chandler,
"
41799,"I cut you out of all of my pictures.
"
41800,"So if you want, I have a bag
"
41801,"with just your heads.
"
41802,"That's okay.
"
41803,"Are you sure? Because you
"
41804,"could make little puppets out of them.
"
41805,"And you could use them in your
"
41806,"Theater of Cruelty.
"
41807,"We can't do that.
"
41808,"What? What can't you do?
"
41809,"Uh, can I talk to you for a second?
"
41810,"Over there?
"
41811,"Uh, we might be leaving now.
"
41812,"Tell me it's you and me ""we.""
"
41813,"She said she wants to slather my body
"
41814,"with stuff and then lick it off.
"
41815,"I'm not even sure what slathering is.
"
41816,"But I definitely want to be
"
41817,"a part of it.
"
41818,"Okay, you cannot do this to me.
"
41819,"You're right. I'm sorry.
"
41820,"You're right.
"
41821,"Uh, can we have three chocolate mousses
"
41822,"to go, please?
"
41823,"I'm out of here.
"
41824,"Here's my credit card.
"
41825,"Dinner's on me. I'm sorry, Chandler.
"
41826,"I hope she throws up on you.
"
41827,"Thanks.
"
41828,"- So...
"
41829,"- Just us.
"
41830,"Ugh, what a crappy night.
"
41831,"Although I have enjoyed the fact that
"
41832,"your shirt's been sticking out...
"
41833,"...of your zipper since you
"
41834,"came back from the bathroom.
"
41835,"[LAUGHS]
"
41836,"Excuse me.
"
41837,"How you doing?
"
41838,"So do we have the best friends,
"
41839,"or what?
"
41840,"Joey's not a friend. He's...
"
41841,"...a stupid man who left us
"
41842,"his credit card.
"
41843,"Another drink? Some dessert?
"
41844,"A big-screen TV?
"
41845,"I will go for that drink.
"
41846,"You got it. Good woman.
"
41847,"A bottle of your
"
41848,"most overpriced champagne.
"
41849,"- Each.
"
41850,"- That's right. Each.
"
41851,"Oh. And a, uh, Rob Roy.
"
41852,"I've always wanted to know.
"
41853,"Happy Valentine's Day.
"
41854,"Oh, I miss you already.
"
41855,"Can you believe this happened?
"
41856,"No, no.
"
41857,"And yet it did.
"
41858,"- Goodbye, Janice.
"
41859,"- Kiss me.
"
41860,"Oh, Chandler. Sorry.
"
41861,"- Hey, Janice.
"
41862,"- Hi, Monica.
"
41863,"Okay. Well, this was very special.
"
41864,"Rach, come see who's out here.
"
41865,"What's going on...?
"
41866,"Oh, my God.
"
41867,"Janice. Hi.
"
41868,"Janice is gonna go away now.
"
41869,"I'll be right back.
"
41870,"Oh. Joey. Look who it is.
"
41871,"Whoa.
"
41872,"Oh, good. Joey's home now.
"
41873,"This is so much fun.
"
41874,"This is like a reunion in the hall.
"
41875,"[LAUGHS]
"
41876,"Hi, Ross. There's someone
"
41877,"I want you to say hi to.
"
41878,"He just happened to call.
"
41879,"Hello, Ross. Yes, that's right.
"
41880,"It's me. How did you know?
"
41881,"[LAUGHS]
"
41882,"I'm just saying if dogs
"
41883,"do experience jet lag, then...
"
41884,"...because of the whole seven-dog-
"
41885,"years-to-one-human-year thing...
"
41886,"...that when a dog flies
"
41887,"from New York to Los Angeles...
"
41888,"...he doesn't just lose three hours,
"
41889,"he loses, like, a week and a half.
"
41890,"[LAUGHS]
"
41891,"- That's funny.
"
41892,"- Yeah.
"
41893,"What?
"
41894,"Who are they?
"
41895,"The, uh, blond is my ex-wife.
"
41896,"And the woman touching her is her...
"
41897,"...close personal friend.
"
41898,"You mean they're lovers?
"
41899,"If you want to put a label on it.
"
41900,"Wow. Heh.
"
41901,"- Anything else I should know?
"
41902,"- Nope. That's it.
"
41903,"Oh, and she's pregnant with my baby.
"
41904,"I always forget that part.
"
41905,"Hello.
"
41906,"Okay. So now we need, um,
"
41907,"sage branches and the sacramental wine.
"
41908,"All I had is oregano and a Fresca.
"
41909,"Um, that's okay.
"
41910,"RACHEL: Ooh.
"
41911,"- Okay.
"
41912,"All right. Now we need the semen
"
41913,"of a righteous man.
"
41914,"Huh. Okay, Pheebs, if we had that...
"
41915,"...we wouldn't be doing the ritual
"
41916,"in the first place.
"
41917,"- Can we start throwing things in?
"
41918,"- Um, yeah, okay.
"
41919,"Oh. Okay. Um...
"
41920,"Okay. Barry's letters.
"
41921,"Adam Ritter's boxer shorts.
"
41922,"And I have the receipt
"
41923,"from my dinner with:
"
41924,"[SPEAKS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
"
41925,"- A picture of Scotty Jared, naked.
"
41926,"- Let me see.
"
41927,"He's wearing a sweater.
"
41928,"- No.
"
41929,"RACHEL & PHOEBE: Ew!
"
41930,"Okay, and here we have
"
41931,"the last of Paolo's grappa.
"
41932,"Wait. Isn't it almost pure...?
"
41933,"[ALL SCREAM]
"
41934,"How can I dump this woman
"
41935,"on Valentine's Day?
"
41936,"I don't know.
"
41937,"You dumped her on New Year's.
"
41938,"Oh, man. In my next life
"
41939,"I'm coming back as a toilet brush.
"
41940,"Hello, funny valentine.
"
41941,"Hi, just Janice.
"
41942,"Hello, Joey, our little matchmaker.
"
41943,"I could just kiss you all over,
"
41944,"and I'm gonna.
"
41945,"Oh. Okay, heh. Ha, ha, okay.
"
41946,"If you don't do it, I will.
"
41947,"So, um, what do you do for a living?
"
41948,"Well, um for the past few years...
"
41949,"[PAGER BEEPS]
"
41950,"Oh, no. You said they could
"
41951,"shoot the spot without you.
"
41952,"SUSAN:
"
41953,"I thought they could.
"
41954,"- Working with children,
"
41955,"which is really fulfilling.
"
41956,"I'll try to get back
"
41957,"as soon as I can. I'm sorry.
"
41958,"KRISTEN: So I'm spending most
"
41959,"of my time teaching science, heh...
"
41960,"...which is funny because
"
41961,"that wasn't even my major.
"
41962,"[LAUGHS]
"
41963,"Now, that is funny.
"
41964,"Hey, do you think...?
"
41965,"Would it be too weird if I invited
"
41966,"Carol over to join us?
"
41967,"Because she's alone now.
"
41968,"And pregnant. And sad.
"
41969,"- I guess.
"
41970,"- Are you sure?
"
41971,"Thanks. Carol.
"
41972,"Wanna come over and join us?
"
41973,"Oh, no. I'm fine.
"
41974,"Come on, stand up. These people
"
41975,"will scooch down. Come on.
"
41976,"Come over here.
"
41977,"You guys will scooch, won't you?
"
41978,"Let's try scooching. Come on.
"
41979,"ROSS: Come on.
"
41980,"CAROL: Thank you.
"
41981,"Uh, Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willet.
"
41982,"- Carol, Kristen.
"
41983,"- How do you do?
"
41984,"Um... Oh, uh, Carol teaches sixth grade.
"
41985,"And, uh, Kristen...
"
41986,"Kristen does something...
"
41987,"...that, funnily enough...
"
41988,"...wasn't even her major.
"
41989,"FIREMAN 1:
"
41990,"What do we got there?
"
41991,"A piece of silk boxer shorts...
"
41992,"...some greeting cards...
"
41993,"...what looks like a
"
41994,"half-charred picture of...
"
41995,"Wow, that guy's hairier
"
41996,"than the chief.
"
41997,"You know, it's a really funny story
"
41998,"how this happened.
"
41999,"It's all right. Don't explain.
"
42000,"It's not the first boyfriend bonfire
"
42001,"we've seen get out of control.
"
42002,"- You're our third call tonight.
"
42003,"- Really?
"
42004,"Sure. Valentine's is our
"
42005,"busiest night of the year.
"
42006,"I brought you something.
"
42007,"Is it loaded?
"
42008,"Oh, little candy hearts.
"
42009,"""Chan and Jan forever.""
"
42010,"I had them made special.
"
42011,"Okay, Janice.
"
42012,"Janice.
"
42013,"Hey, Janice.
"
42014,"Look, there's no way for me
"
42015,"to tell you this.
"
42016,"At least, there's no new way
"
42017,"for me to tell you this.
"
42018,"I just don't think things
"
42019,"are gonna work out.
"
42020,"That's fine.
"
42021,"- It is?
"
42022,"- Mm-hm.
"
42023,"Because I know that this
"
42024,"isn't the end.
"
42025,"Oh, no. You see, actually, it is.
"
42026,"No, it isn't. Because you
"
42027,"won't let that happen.
"
42028,"Don't you know it yet?
"
42029,"You love me, Chandler Bing.
"
42030,"Oh, no, I don't.
"
42031,"Then why do you think
"
42032,"we keep ending up together?
"
42033,"New Year's, who invited who?
"
42034,"Valentine's, who asked who
"
42035,"into whose bed?
"
42036,"- I did, but...
"
42037,"- You seek me out.
"
42038,"Something deep in your soul
"
42039,"calls out to me like a foghorn.
"
42040,"Janice. Janice.
"
42041,"You want me. You need me.
"
42042,"You can't live without me.
"
42043,"And you know it.
"
42044,"You just don't know you know it.
"
42045,"See you.
"
42046,"Call me.
"
42047,"It's not true. I never called
"
42048,"your mother a wolverine.
"
42049,"You did so. I swear.
"
42050,"I swear to...
"
42051,"How long has she been in the bathroom?
"
42052,"Uh, I don't think she's in the bathroom.
"
42053,"Her coat is gone.
"
42054,"Well, maybe it's cold in there.
"
42055,"Maybe I screwed up the first date
"
42056,"I had in nine years.
"
42057,"- That could be it.
"
42058,"- Oh, God.
"
42059,"You know, this is still pretty hot.
"
42060,"Mushroom.
"
42061,"Smile.
"
42062,"They won't all be like this.
"
42063,"Some might even stay through dinner.
"
42064,"- I'm sorry. That's not funny.
"
42065,"- No, it's just...
"
42066,"Well, you know the whole
"
42067,"getting-on-with-your-life thing?
"
42068,"Well, do I have to?
"
42069,"I mean, well, I'm sitting here
"
42070,"with this cute woman...
"
42071,"...and she's perfectly nice,
"
42072,"you know?
"
42073,"But there's...
"
42074,"That's it.
"
42075,"And, uh, then I'm here talking to you,
"
42076,"and it's easy and it's fun.
"
42077,"And I don't have to...
"
42078,"- I know.
"
42079,"- You know?
"
42080,"Here's a wacky thought. Um, ahem.
"
42081,"- Let's say you and I give it another shot.
"
42082,"- Ross.
"
42083,"No, no, I know what you're gonna say.
"
42084,"You're a lesbian.
"
42085,"But what do you say we just
"
42086,"put that aside for now, you know?
"
42087,"Let's just stick a pin in it, okay?
"
42088,"Because we're great together,
"
42089,"you know?
"
42090,"You can't deny it.
"
42091,"And besides, you're carrying my baby.
"
42092,"- I mean, how perfect is that?
"
42093,"- Ross...
"
42094,"You keep saying that,
"
42095,"but there's something right here.
"
42096,"I love you.
"
42097,"I love you too.
"
42098,"- But...
"
42099,"- No ""but."" No ""but.""
"
42100,"You know that thing
"
42101,"we put over here with the pin in it?
"
42102,"It's time to take the pin out.
"
42103,"Yeah.
"
42104,"You'll find someone. I know you will.
"
42105,"The right woman is waiting for you.
"
42106,"It's easy for you to say.
"
42107,"You found one already.
"
42108,"All you need is a woman who likes men
"
42109,"and you'll be set.
"
42110,"Not her.
"
42111,"We get off around midnight.
"
42112,"Why don't we pick you up then?
"
42113,"RACHEL: Okay.
"
42114,"MONICA: Great.
"
42115,"So, um, will you bring the truck?
"
42116,"- I'll even let you ring the bell.
"
42117,"- Wohoo!
"
42118,"FIREMAN 1: We'll see you later.
"
42119,"FIREMAN 2: Bye. See you later.
"
42120,"Thanks. See you.
"
42121,"Oh, my God.
"
42122,"See, there you go.
"
42123,"- The cleansing worked.
"
42124,"MONICA: You're right.
"
42125,"They're nice guys.
"
42126,"They're firemen guys.
"
42127,"FIREMAN 1: You tell them you're married?
"
42128,"FIREMAN 2: No way.
"
42129,"My girlfriend doesn't know.
"
42130,"I'm not gonna tell them.
"
42131,"Coffee.
"
42132,"- Thank you.
"
42133,"- Cappuccino.
"
42134,"[SPEAKING IN ITALIAN]
"
42135,"And a nice hot cider for Monica.
"
42136,"Aw, thank you.
"
42137,"- Rach?
"
42138,"- Yeah?
"
42139,"Why does my cinnamon stick
"
42140,"have an eraser?
"
42141,"Oh.
"
42142,"Oh, heh.
"
42143,"That's why.
"
42144,"Sorry.
"
42145,"TEDLOCK:
"
42146,"Chandler?
"
42147,"Miss Tedlock,
"
42148,"you're looking lovely today.
"
42149,"May I say that is a very
"
42150,"flattering sleeve length on you?
"
42151,"Yes.
"
42152,"Well, Mr. Costilick would like you to stop
"
42153,"by his office at the end of the day.
"
42154,"Oh, listen, if this is about those prank
"
42155,"memos, I had nothing to do with them.
"
42156,"Really, nothing at all. Really.
"
42157,"Nothing.
"
42158,"Hey, you guys. You guys.
"
42159,"Chandler's coming, and he says
"
42160,"he has this incredible news.
"
42161,"So when he gets here,
"
42162,"let's all act like, you know...
"
42163,"- Hey.
"
42164,"GROUP: Hey.
"
42165,"Never mind.
"
42166,"But it was gonna be really good.
"
42167,"ROSS: What's going on?
"
42168,"RACHEL: What's up?
"
42169,"It's a typical day at work.
"
42170,"I'm inputting my numbers...
"
42171,"...and Big Al calls me into his office...
"
42172,"...and tells me he wants to make me
"
42173,"processing supervisor.
"
42174,"- That is great!
"
42175,"- Congratulations.
"
42176,"So I quit.
"
42177,"BOTH:
"
42178,"Why?
"
42179,"Why?
"
42180,"This was supposed to be a temp job.
"
42181,"Yeah, Chandler,
"
42182,"you've been there for five years.
"
42183,"I know, but if I took it this...
"
42184,"...it'd be like admitting
"
42185,"that this is what I actually do.
"
42186,"So was it a lot more money?
"
42187,"Doesn't matter. I just don't want
"
42188,"to be one of those guys...
"
42189,"...that's in his office until 12:00 at night
"
42190,"worrying about the WENUS.
"
42191,"""The WENUS""?
"
42192,"Weekly estimated net usage system.
"
42193,"It's a processing term.
"
42194,"Oh, that WENUS.
"
42195,"So, what are you gonna do?
"
42196,"I don't know. That's the thing.
"
42197,"I don't know.
"
42198,"I'm not gonna figure it out
"
42199,"working there.
"
42200,"Oh! I have something you can do.
"
42201,"I have this new massage client.
"
42202,"Steve.
"
42203,"Anyway, um, he's opening up
"
42204,"a restaurant...
"
42205,"...and he's looking for a head chef.
"
42206,"Um, hi there.
"
42207,"Hi.
"
42208,"Oh, yeah, I know. You're a chef, I know,
"
42209,"and I thought of you first.
"
42210,"But, um, Chandler's the one
"
42211,"who needs a job right now, so...
"
42212,"Yeah, I just don't have a lot
"
42213,"of chefing experience.
"
42214,"Unless it's an all-toast restaurant.
"
42215,"- Yeah. Yeah.
"
42216,"- Well, what kind of food is he looking for?
"
42217,"He wants to do something eclectic,
"
42218,"so he's looking for someone...
"
42219,"...who can, you know,
"
42220,"create the entire menu.
"
42221,"- Oh, my God.
"
42222,"- Yeah, I know.
"
42223,"So, what do you think?
"
42224,"Thanks, Pheeb. I just don't really
"
42225,"see myself in a big white hat.
"
42226,"Okay.
"
42227,"Oh, Monica. Guess what?
"
42228,"Can you see my nipples
"
42229,"through this shirt?
"
42230,"No, but don't worry.
"
42231,"I'm sure they're still there.
"
42232,"Where you going, Mr. Suit-ey Man?
"
42233,"Well, I have an appointment
"
42234,"to see Dr. Robert Pilman...
"
42235,"...career counselor-a-go-go.
"
42236,"I added the ""a-go-go.""
"
42237,"Career counselor?
"
42238,"Hey, you guys all know
"
42239,"what you want to do.
"
42240,"I don't.
"
42241,"Hey, you guys in the living room
"
42242,"all know what you want to do.
"
42243,"You know, you have goals.
"
42244,"You have dreams.
"
42245,"I don't have a dream.
"
42246,"Ah, the lesser known

42247,"""I Don't Have a Dream"" speech.
"
42248,"Oh, I love my life. I love my life.
"

"
42250,"The meeting with that guy went great?
"
42251,"So great. He showed me
"
42252,"where the restaurant's gonna be.
"
42253,"It's this cute little place on 10th Street.
"
42254,"It's not too big, not too small.
"
42255,"It's just right.
"
42256,"Was it formerly owned
"
42257,"by a blond woman and some bears?
"
42258,"So anyway, I'm cooking dinner for him
"
42259,"Monday night. Kind of like an audition.
"
42260,"And Phoebe, he really wants you
"
42261,"to be here, which will be great for me.
"
42262,"Because you can make yummy noises.
"
42263,"- What are you gonna make?
"
42264,"- Yummy noises.
"
42265,"And, Monica, what are you gonna make?
"
42266,"I don't know. I don't know.
"
42267,"It's just gotta be so great.
"
42268,"Oh! I know what you can make. I know.
"
42269,"Oh, you should make that thing,
"
42270,"you know, with the stuff.
"
42271,"You know that thing with the stuff?
"
42272,"Okay, I don't know.
"
42273,"Hey, guys, anyone know a good date place
"
42274,"in the neighborhood?
"
42275,"Uh, how about Tony's? If you can finish
"
42276,"a 32-ounce steak, it's free.
"
42277,"Okay. Ahem.
"
42278,"Hey, does anyone know a good place
"
42279,"if you're not dating a puma?
"
42280,"- Who are you going out with?
"
42281,"- Oh, is this the bug lady?
"
42282,"[AS BUG LADY]
"
42283,"I love you, Ross.
"
42284,"Her name is Celia. She's not a bug lady.
"
42285,"She's curator of insects at the museum.
"
42286,"So, what are you guys gonna do?
"
42287,"Well, I just thought we'd go to dinner,
"
42288,"then bring her back to my place...
"
42289,"...and I'd introduce her to my monkey.
"
42290,"And he's not speaking metaphorically.
"
42291,"- So back to your place?
"
42292,"- Uh-huh.
"
42293,"You thinking maybe, heh-heh?
"
42294,"Ahem, well, I don't know, heh-heh.
"
42295,"I'm hoping heh-heh.
"
42296,"I'm telling you,
"
42297,"that monkey's a chick magnet.
"
42298,"She's gonna one look at his furry, cute
"
42299,"little face and it'll seal the deal.
"
42300,"- Aah!
"
42301,"ROSS: Celia, don't worry.
"
42302,"Celia, he's not gonna hurt you.
"
42303,"Soothing tones, Celia, soothing tones.
"
42304,"- Okay, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
"
42305,"- Aah!
"
42306,"- Here, here. Marcel? Marcel?
"
42307,"- I can't stand this.
"
42308,"- He's got his claws on my...
"
42309,"- Yeah, all right.
"
42310,"Okay, try this salmon mousse.
"
42311,"- Mm. Good.
"
42312,"MONICA: Yeah?
"
42313,"Is it better than
"
42314,"the other salmon mousse?
"
42315,"It's creamier.
"
42316,"Yeah? Well, is that better?
"
42317,"I don't know.
"
42318,"We're talking about whipped fish, Monica.
"
42319,"I'm just happy I'm keeping it down,
"
42320,"you know?
"
42321,"God, what happened to you?
"
42322,"Eight and a half hours
"
42323,"of aptitude tests...
"
42324,"...intelligence tests, personality tests,
"
42325,"and what do I learn?
"
42326,"""You're ideally suited for a career

42329,"That's so great, because you
"
42330,"already know how to do that.
"
42331,"Can you believe it?
"
42332,"Don't I seem like somebody who should
"
42333,"be doing something really cool?
"
42334,"You know, I just always
"
42335,"pictured myself doing something...
"
42336,"Something.
"
42337,"Oh, Chandler, I know, I know.

42338,"Oh, hey, you can see your nipples

42342,"Maybe this will cheer you up.
"
42343,"Ooh, you know, um,
"
42344,"I had a grape about five hours ago...
"
42345,"...so I better split this with you.
"
42346,"It's supposed to be that small.
"
42347,"It's a pre-appetizer.

42348,"The French call it an amuse-bouche.
"
42349,"Well, it is amusing.

42350,"[PHONE RINGS]
"
42351,"Hello? Oh, hi, Wendy.
"
42352,"Yeah, 8:00.
"
42353,"What did we say? Ten dollars an hour?
"
42354,"Okay, great.
"
42355,"All right, I'll see you then. Bye.
"
42356,"Ten dollars an hour for what?
"
42357,"I asked a waitress at work
"
42358,"to help me out.
"
42359,"Waitressing?
"
42360,"Uh-oh.
"
42361,"Ha, ha. Of course I thought of you.
"
42362,"But...
"
42363,"- But...
"
42364,"- But, but?
"
42365,"But, you see, it's just this night
"
42366,"has to go just perfect, you know...
"
42367,"...and, well, Wendy's more
"
42368,"of a professional waitress.
"
42369,"Oh.
"
42370,"I see. Yes. And I've sort of been
"
42371,"maintaining my amateur status...
"
42372,"...so that I can waitress in the Olympics.
"
42373,"You know, I don't mean to brag,
"
42374,"but I waited tables at Innsbruck in '76.
"
42375,"Amuse-bouche?
"
42376,"Talk to me.
"
42377,"Okay, uh, ahem, a weird thing happened
"
42378,"to me on the train this morning...
"
42379,"No, no, no. Talk dirty.
"
42380,"- Wow. Here?
"
42381,"- Come on.
"
42382,"Come on.
"
42383,"Say something...

42393,"- Vulva.

42394,"""Vulva""?
"
42395,"All right, I panicked, all right?
"
42396,"She took me by surprise.
"
42397,"You know, but it wasn't a total loss.
"
42398,"I mean, uh, we ended up cuddling.
"
42399,"Whoa, you cuddled? How many times?
"
42400,"Shut up. It was nice. I just...
"
42401,"I just don't think I'm the dirty-talking
"
42402,"kind of guy, you know?
"
42403,"What's the big deal?
"
42404,"Just say what you want to do to her.
"
42405,"Or what you want her to do to you.
"
42406,"Or what you think other people
"
42407,"might be doing to each other.
"
42408,"Look, I tell you what.
"
42409,"Try something on me.
"
42410,"Please be kidding.
"
42411,"Why not? Come on.
"
42412,"Just close your eyes and tell me
"
42413,"what you'd like to be doing right now.
"
42414,"Okay, I'm, uh...
"
42415,"I'm in my apartment...

"
42417,"That's it. You're not there.
"
42418,"We're not having this conversation.

"
42422,"All right, ready? Look.

"
42432,"- You wanna see her again, right?
"
42433,"- Sure.
"
42434,"Well, if you can't talk dirty to me,
"
42435,"how are you gonna talk dirty to her?
"
42436,"Now tell me you want to caress my butt.
"
42437,"Okay, turn around.
"
42438,"I just don't want you staring at me
"
42439,"when I'm doing this.
"
42440,"All right, all right.
"
42441,"I'm not looking. Go ahead.

"
42471,"How's life on the 15th floor?
"
42472,"Yeah, I miss you too.
"
42473,"Yeah, it's a lot less satisfying to steal pens
"
42474,"from your own home, you know?
"
42475,"Well, that's very generous.
"
42476,"Uh, but look, this isn't about the money.
"
42477,"You know? I need something
"
42478,"that's more than a job.
"
42479,"I need something I really care about...
"
42480,"And that's on top of the year-end

42493,"Ah.
"
42494,"Huh?
"
42495,"Wow. It's huge.
"
42496,"It's so much bigger than the cubicle.

42497,"Oh, this is a cube.
"
42498,"Look at this.
"
42499,"[GASPS]
"
42500,"You have a window!

"
42546,"Well, it's a lovely apartment.
"
42547,"Oh, thank you. Would you like a tour?

"
42552,"What?
"

"
42604,"- Well, then you can't have any.
"
42605,"- Give them to me.
"
42606,"- This is not worth it.

42622,"Hey...
"
42623,"What a tool.
"
42624,"You don't want to work
"

"
42626,"I know. It's just... I don't know,
"
42627,"I just thought that this was, you know, ""it.""
"
42628,"Look, you'll get there.
"
42629,"You're an amazing chef.
"
42630,"Yeah, you know all those yummy noises?
"
42631,"I wasn't faking.
"
42632,"[CLEARS THROAT]
"
42633,"So, uh, how did it go with Celia?
"
42634,"Oh, uh, I was unbelievable.
"
42635,"All right, Ross.
"
42636,"I was the James Michener of dirty talk.
"
42637,"It was the most elaborate filth
"
42638,"you have ever heard.
"
42639,"I mean, there were characters,
"
42640,"plot lines...
"
42641,"...themes, a motif.
"
42642,"At one point, there were villagers.
"
42643,"Oh, and, uh...
"
42644,"Well, um, you know, by the time
"
42645,"we finished with all the dirty talk...
"
42646,"...it was kind of late
"
42647,"and we were both exhausted, so...
"
42648,"- You cuddled.
"
42649,"- Yeah, which was nice.
"
42650,"Do you guys want to try to catch
"
42651,"a late movie or something?
"
42652,"Maybe, but shouldn't we wait
"
42653,"for Chandler?
"
42654,"Whoa. Where the hell is he?
"
42655,"Yes, Fran, I know what time it is...
"

43525,"Okay, listen, I'm thinking, why don't we
"
43526,"just tell them who we really are?
"
43527,"- I mean, I think it'll be fine.
"
43528,"- It will not. We'll get in trouble.
"
43529,"Monica, would you stop being
"
43530,"such a wuss?
"
43531,"A wuss? Excuse me
"
43532,"for living in the real world.
"
43533,"- So?
"
43534,"- So they still seem normal.
"
43535,"That's because they are.
"
43536,"You have to admit, when we go out
"
43537,"with women we meet at the hospital...
"
43538,"Would you relax?
"
43539,"Take a look around.
"
43540,"There are no pagan altars.
"
43541,"No piles of bones in the corners.
"
43542,"They're fine. Go like this:
"
43543,"I said we are not going to do it, okay?
"
43544,"Sometimes you can be such a big baby.
"
43545,"- I am not a baby.
"
43546,"- Be serious.
"
43547,"- You get uptight...
"
43548,"- You act like a princess.
"
43549,"- You know what? You know what?
"
43550,"- What? What?
"
43551,"Every day you are becoming
"
43552,"more and more like your mother.
"
43553,"Excuse me. Hello, here we go.
"
43554,"This is a great place.
"
43555,"How long have you lived here?
"
43556,"Thanks. I've been here
"
43557,"about six years.
"
43558,"And Rachel moved in a few months ago.
"
43559,"See, I was supposed to get married...
"
43560,"...but, um, I left the guy at the altar.
"
43561,"- Really?
"
43562,"- Yeah.
"
43563,"Yeah, I know
"
43564,"it's pretty selfish, but, heh...
"
43565,"...hey, that's me.
"
43566,"- Why don't you try the hummus?
"
43567,"RACHEL: Ahem.
"
43568,"So, Monica, what do you do?
"
43569,"Uh, I am a, uh, chef
"
43570,"at a restaurant uptown.
"
43571,"- Oh, good for you.
"
43572,"- Yeah, it is.
"
43573,"Mostly because I get to boss people
"
43574,"around, which I just love to do.
"
43575,"Well, this hummus is great.
"
43576,"God bless the chickpea.
"
43577,"[LAUGHING]
"
43578,"Oh, God.
"
43579,"I am so spoiled.
"
43580,"That's it.
"
43581,"And by the way, have I mentioned
"
43582,"that back in high school...
"
43583,"...I was a cow?
"
43584,"I used to wet my bed.
"
43585,"I use my breasts to get
"
43586,"other people's attention.
"
43587,"We both do that.
"
43588,"[PHONE RINGING]
"
43589,"Monica and Rachel's apartment.
"
43590,"Uh... Uh, yeah, just one second.
"
43591,"Uh, Rachel, it's your dad.
"
43592,"Hi, Dad.
"
43593,"No, no. It's me.
"
43594,"Listen, Dad,
"
43595,"I can't talk right now. Um...
"
43596,"But there's something, um...
"
43597,"There's something
"
43598,"that I've been meaning to tell you.
"
43599,"Excuse me.
"
43600,"Remember back in freshman year?
"
43601,"Well, Billy Dreskin and I
"
43602,"had sex on your bed.
"
43603,"Daddy...
"
43604,"Daddy... Daddy, why?
"
43605,"Why would I sleep with Billy Dreskin?
"
43606,"His father tried to put
"
43607,"you out of business.
"
43608,"You are dead.
"
43609,"Ross, he's got the remote again.
"
43610,"Good.
"
43611,"Maybe he can switch it back.
"
43612,"[SPEAKING IN SPANISH]
"
43613,"Maybe not.
"
43614,"Hello?
"
43615,"Uh, ueah... Uh...
"
43616,"Okay, uh, hold on a second and let me
"
43617,"just check and see if she's here.
"
43618,"It's the woman from the hospital.
"
43619,"There's a problem with the form.
"
43620,"Oh, God, what do we do?
"
43621,"I don't know.
"
43622,"Just find out what they want.
"
43623,"Okay. No, you do it.
"
43624,"Hello. This is Monica.
"
43625,"Yeah?
"
43626,"Oh. Okay.
"
43627,"Yes, we'll be right down.
"
43628,"Thank you.
"
43629,"We forgot to sign
"
43630,"one of the admissions forms.
"
43631,"- Okay, you're right, this wasn't worth it.
"
43632,"- Thank you.
"
43633,"- Okay, let me just change.
"
43634,"- Yes.
"
43635,"- Hey.
"
43636,"- Hey.
"
43637,"Trouble?
"
43638,"Your sister stood me up
"
43639,"the other night.
"
43640,"Oh, no. Don't you hate it
"
43641,"when people aren't there for you?
"
43642,"- Did you try calling her?
"
43643,"- I've been trying for two days.
"
43644,"When I called the restaurant,
"
43645,"they said she was too busy to talk.
"
43646,"I can't believe
"
43647,"she's blowing me off.
"
43648,"Hey.
"
43649,"Oh.
"
43650,"Um, you got a minute?
"
43651,"Um, yeah, I'm just working.
"
43652,"- So...
"
43653,"- Uh-huh?
"
43654,"Um, oh, I got you a birthday present.
"
43655,"Oh, wow, you remembered.
"
43656,"Oh. It's a Judy Jetson Thermos.
"
43657,"Right. Like the kind you...
"
43658,"Right.
"
43659,"Oh, I got something for you too.
"
43660,"How'd you know I was coming?
"
43661,"Um, yeah, um, ""twin"" thing.
"
43662,"I can't believe you did this.
"
43663,"I can't believe you...
"
43664,"...did this.
"
43665,"So, what's the deal with, um,
"
43666,"you and Joey?
"
43667,"Oh, right.
"
43668,"He is so great. But that's over.
"
43669,"- Does he know?
"
43670,"- Who?
"
43671,"Joey. You know, um, ahem,
"
43672,"he's really nutsy about you.
"
43673,"He is? Why?
"
43674,"- You got me.
"
43675,"- Right.
"
43676,"Excuse me...
"
43677,"...doesn't this come
"
43678,"with a side salad?
"
43679,"So, um, are you gonna call him?
"
43680,"- What, you think he likes me?
"
43681,"- No. Joey.
"
43682,"Oh. No, no. He is so smart.
"
43683,"He'll figure it out.
"
43684,"Do you want some chicken?
"
43685,"No, no.
"
43686,"No food with a face, remember?
"
43687,"You have not changed.
"
43688,"Yeah, you too.
"
43689,"- Hi. Remember us?
"
43690,"- Mm-hm.
"
43691,"Um, yeah, you just called about needing
"
43692,"a signature on the admissions form?
"
43693,"Well, it turns out
"
43694,"we need a whole new one.
"
43695,"Because, um, you see...
"
43696,"...I put the wrong name again.
"
43697,"- Because, um...
"
43698,"- You're that stupid.
"
43699,"I am. I'm that stupid.
"
43700,"Yeah, and I'm just gonna pay
"
43701,"for this with a check.
"
43702,"You know, your insurance will cover that.
"
43703,"Yeah, I know.
"
43704,"I'm just not that bright either.
"
43705,"Okay, worst case scenario:
"
43706,"- Say you never feel like a father.
"
43707,"- Uh-huh.
"
43708,"Say your son never feels
"
43709,"connected to you as one.
"
43710,"Say all of his relationships
"
43711,"are affected by this.
"
43712,"Do you have a point?
"
43713,"You know, you'd think I would.

"
43718,"Yours. I just got 43 points for ""kidney.""
"
43719,"No, you got zero points for ""idney.""

"
43730,"This hospital is for people.
"
43731,"Lady, he is people.
"
43732,"He has a name, okay?
"
43733,"He watches Jeopardy...

43734,"...he touches himself
"
43735,"when nobody's watching.

"
43752,"I'm sorry.
"
43753,"I don't get it.
"
43754,"What happened?
"
43755,"What about everything
"
43756,"you said under the bridge?
"
43757,"Yeah, um, ahem...
"
43758,"You know, just forget about
"
43759,"what I said under the bridge.
"
43760,"I was talking crazy that night.
"
43761,"I was so drunk.
"
43762,"You don't drink.
"
43763,"That's right, I don't.
"
43764,"But I was drunk on you.
"
43765,"- Oh, Urs.
"
43766,"- But, yeah, so it's not gonna work.
"
43767,"Why? Is it because
"
43768,"I'm friends with Phoebe?
"
43769,"If it was, would you
"
43770,"stop hanging out with her?
"
43771,"No.
"
43772,"No, I couldn't do that.
"
43773,"Um, then, yeah, it's because of Phoebe.
"
43774,"So you know, it's either her or me.
"
43775,"Then, uh... Then I'm sorry.
"
43776,"You know...
"
43777,"...you're gonna be
"
43778,"really, really hard to get over.
"
43779,"I know.
"
43780,"I don't know whether it's just
"
43781,"because we're breaking up or what...
"
43782,"...but you have never
"
43783,"looked so beautiful.
"
43784,"Really?
"
43785,"- Pheebs?
"
43786,"- Yeah.
"

"
43788,"- We just got the message.
"
43789,"- Is he all right?
"
43790,"Yeah, the doctor got the K out.
"

43957,"The Jamestown colony of Virginia.

"
43961,"You owe us money for the game.
"
43962,"Oh, right.
"
43963,"You know what, guys? It's their first time.
"
43964,"Why don't we forget about the money?
"
43965,"Hell, no. We'll pay.
"
43966,"Okay, Monica,
"
43967,"I had another answer all ready.
"
43968,"And you know what?
"
43969,"- We want a rematch.
"
43970,"- Well, that's fine with me.
"
43971,"Could use the money.
"
43972,"So, basically, you get your ya-yas
"
43973,"by taking money from all of your friends.
"
43974,"- Yeah.
"
43975,"- Yes, and I get my ya-yas from lkea.
"
43976,"You have to put them together yourself,
"
43977,"but they cost a little less.
"
43978,"Look, Rachel, this is poker.
"
43979,"I play to win, all right?
"
43980,"In order for me to win,
"
43981,"other people have to lose.
"
43982,"So if you're gonna play poker with me,
"
43983,"don't expect me to be a nice guy.
"
43984,"Okay, because once those cards
"
43985,"are dealt...
"
43986,"Yeah?
"

"

44385,"""Forget relationships.

"
44387,"The whole, uh, penis embargo?
"
44388,"Oh, I don't know.
"
44389,"I guess it's not about no guys.
"
44390,"- It's about the right guy, you know?
"
44391,"- Hmm.
"
44392,"With Barry, it was safe and it was easy,
"
44393,"but there was no heat.
"
44394,"- Mm.
"
44395,"- You know, with Paolo...
"
44396,"...that's all there was, was heat.
"
44397,"And I mean, it was just
"
44398,"this raw, animal, sexual...
"
44399,"Right, right. I got it.
"
44400,"I was there.
"
44401,"I mean, do you think
"
44402,"you can ever have both?
"
44403,"You know?
"
44404,"Someone who's like your best friend...
"
44405,"...but then also can make
"
44406,"your toes curl.
"
44407,"Yes, yes.
"
44408,"Yes. Yes, I do. I really do.
"
44409,"Uh, in fact, it's funny.
"
44410,"Very often, someone who
"
44411,"you wouldn't think could...
"
44412,"...curl your toes...
"
44413,"...might just be the one who...
"
44414,"Hi.
"
44415,"- Gets interrupted. Hi.
"
44416,"Hey, guys, how was the movie?
"
44417,"- Oh, so wonderful.
"
44418,"- Oh, it was so good.
"
44419,"- Suck fest.
"
44420,"- Total chick flick.
"
44421,"I'm sorry it wasn't one of those movies...
"
44422,"...with, like, you know, like,
"
44423,"guns and bombs...
"
44424,"...and, like, buses going really fast.
"
44425,"Hey, I don't need violence
"
44426,"to enjoy a movie...
"
44427,"...just so long as there's a little nudity.
"
44428,"- There was nudity.
"
44429,"- I meant female nudity.
"
44430,"All right, I don't need to see
"
44431,"Lou Grant frolicking.
"
44432,"MONICA & CHANDLER & PHOEBE:
"
44433,"Hugh. Hugh Grant.
"
44434,"All right, I've got to go. Ahem.
"
44435,"Come on, Marcel. Come on.
"
44436,"Yeah, we're gonna go take a bath.
"
44437,"Yes, we are, aren't we? Yes, we are.
"
44438,"They're still just friends, right?
"
44439,"And I will see you tomorrow.
"
44440,"That's right. You're gonna spend tomorrow
"
44441,"at Aunt Rachel's, aren't you?
"
44442,"Hang on, hang on.
"
44443,"Does Aunt Monica get a say in this?
"
44444,"Please, Aunt Monica, please? Ha, ha.
"
44445,"Oh, unclench.
"
44446,"You're not even gonna be here.
"
44447,"CHANDLER:
"
44448,"I can't believe we're having this discussion.
"
44449,"I agree. I'm, like, in disbelief.
"
44450,"Don't you think if things were gonna happen
"
44451,"with Rachel, they would've happened?
"
44452,"I'm telling you,
"
44453,"she said she's looking for a relationship...
"
44454,"...with someone exactly like me.
"
44455,"She really said that?
"
44456,"Well, I added the ""exactly like me"" part.
"
44457,"But she said she's looking for someone.
"
44458,"And someone is gonna be there tonight.
"
44459,"""Tonight"" tonight?
"
44460,"Well, I think it's perfect.
"
44461,"It's just gonna be the two of us.
"
44462,"She spent all day
"
44463,"taking care of my monkey.
"
44464,"I can't remember the last time
"
44465,"I got a girl to take care of my monkey.
"
44466,"[JOEY LAUGHING]
"
44467,"Anyway, you know, I figured after work,
"
44468,"I'd go pick up a bottle of wine...
"
44469,"...go over there and, uh, try to woo her.
"
44470,"Hey, you know what you should do?
"
44471,"You should take her back to the 1890s
"
44472,"when that phrase was last used.
"
44473,"If you keep this up...
"
44474,"...you'll be finished with this sucker
"
44475,"by the end of the week.
"
44476,"Now, the one in the feathered boa,
"
44477,"that's Dr. Francis.
"
44478,"Now, she used to be a man.
"
44479,"Oh, look. See, now, there's Raven.
"
44480,"We hate her.
"
44481,"We're glad she's dying.
"
44482,"And then... What? Marcel.
"
44483,"Are you playing with Monica's shoes?
"
44484,"You know you're not supposed to...
"
44485,"Whoa, whoa.
"
44486,"Marcel, did you poo in the shoe?
"
44487,"Oh, Marcel. Bad monkey.
"
44488,"Oh, God.
"
44489,"Oh.
"
44490,"Sorry, Barry.
"
44491,"A little engagement gift.
"
44492,"I'm sure you didn't register for that.
"
44493,"[GUNSHOT ON TV]
"
44494,"Who died? Who died?
"
44495,"Roll him over. Oh, come on, roll him over.
"
44496,"Oh!
"
44497,"Well, we know it wasn't Dexter,
"
44498,"right, Marcel? Because...
"
44499,"Marcel? Marcel? Marc...?
"
44500,"- How could you lose him?
"
44501,"- I don't know, I don't know.
"
44502,"We were watching TV,
"
44503,"and then he pooped in Monica's shoe...
"
44504,"Wait. He pooped in my shoe?
"
44505,"Which one?
"
44506,"I don't know. The left one.
"
44507,"Which ones?
"
44508,"Oh, those little clunky Amish things
"
44509,"you think go with everything.
"
44510,"- Hey.
"
44511,"GROUP: Hey.
"
44512,"Whoa, oh.
"
44513,"Why is the air in here so negative?
"
44514,"- Rachel lost Marcel.
"
44515,"- Oh, no. How?
"
44516,"- He pooped in my shoe.
"
44517,"- Which one?
"
44518,"Those cute little black ones
"
44519,"I wear all the time.
"
44520,"No, which one? Ha, ha.
"
44521,"The right or left?
"
44522,"Because the left one is lucky.
"
44523,"Come on, you guys.
"
44524,"What am I gonna do?
"
44525,"All right, all right, all right.
"
44526,"You're a monkey...
"
44527,"...you're loose in the city.
"
44528,"Where do you go?
"
44529,"Okay, it's his first time out...
"
44530,"...so he's probably gonna want
"
44531,"to do some of the touristy things.
"
44532,"I'll go to Cats.
"
44533,"You go to the Russian Tea Room.
"
44534,"Oh, my God! Come on, you guys.
"
44535,"He's gonna be home any minute.
"
44536,"He's gonna kill me.
"
44537,"Start with the building.
"
44538,"You take the first and second floor.
"
44539,"Phoebe and I will take third and fourth.
"
44540,"Whoa, whoa. What am I gonna do?
"
44541,"Okay, you stay here
"
44542,"and just wait by the phone.
"
44543,"Spray Lysol in my shoe
"
44544,"and wait for Ross to kill you.
"
44545,"Does anybody want to trade?
"
44546,"[SIGHS]
"
44547,"What do you want?
"
44548,"Mr. Heckles, our friend lost a monkey.
"
44549,"Have you seen it?
"
44550,"I left a Belgian waffle out here.
"
44551,"Did you take it?
"
44552,"No.
"
44553,"Why would you leave your Belgian waffle
"
44554,"in the hall?
"
44555,"I wasn't ready for it.
"
44556,"The monkey, have you seen a monkey?
"
44557,"I saw Regis Philbin once.
"
44558,"Thank you, Mr. Heckles.
"
44559,"You owe me a waffle.
"
44560,"Okay, he's a black capuchin monkey
"
44561,"with a white face...
"
44562,"...with Russian dressing
"
44563,"and pickles on the side.
"
44564,"Okay, thanks.
"
44565,"- Hi.
"
44566,"- Hey. How did it go today?
"
44567,"- Oh, great. It went great. Really great.
"
44568,"- Yeah.
"
44569,"- Hey, is that wine?
"
44570,"- Yeah. Yeah.
"
44571,"You, uh, want some?
"
44572,"- Oh, I would love some.
"
44573,"- Yeah.
"
44574,"But you know what? You know what?
"
44575,"Let's not drink it here.
"
44576,"I'm feeling kind of crazy.
"
44577,"Do you want to go to Newark?
"
44578,"Uh, okay. Yeah.
"
44579,"We could do that. But before we head off
"
44580,"to the murder capital of the Northeast...
"
44581,"...I was, uh, kind of wanted
"
44582,"to run something by you.
"
44583,"You know how we were,
"
44584,"you know, talking before...
"
44585,"...about relationships and stuff, well...
"
44586,"- Oh, God, Ross, I cannot do this.
"
44587,"- Okay, quick and painful.
"
44588,"Oh, God.
"
44589,"Okay, all right. All right, okay.
"
44590,"Ross, please don't hate me.
"
44591,"Oh, what? What? What?
"
44592,"[CHUCKLES]
"
44593,"You know Marcel?
"
44594,"- Yeah?
"
44595,"- Well, ahem.
"
44596,"I kind of, uh... I kind of lost him.
"
44597,"[INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE]
"
44598,"I can't believe this.
"
44599,"I mean, all I asked you to do
"
44600,"was keep him in the apartment.
"
44601,"I know, I know. I'm sorry.
"
44602,"You know what?
"
44603,"I guess it's partially my fault.
"
44604,"I shouldn't have asked you
"
44605,"to start off with a monkey.
"
44606,"I should have started you off with, like,
"
44607,"a pen or a pencil.
"
44608,"Ross, I'm doing everything that I can.
"
44609,"I've got everybody looking
"
44610,"for him and I got...

"
44612,"- Who is it?
"
44613,"LUISA [OVER INTERCOM]: Animal Control.
"
44614,"- See, I've even got Animal Control.
"
44615,"- You called Animal Control?
"
44616,"Uh-huh.
"
44617,"Why? Do you not like them?
"
44618,"Heh. Marcel is an illegal exotic animal.
"
44619,"I'm not allowed to have him in the city.
"
44620,"If they find him,
"
44621,"they'll take him away from me.
"
44622,"Okay, well, now, see,
"
44623,"you never ever, ever told us that.
"
44624,"That's right, because I didn't expect you
"
44625,"we're gonna invite them to the apartment.
"
44626,"[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
"
44627,"Hi. Thanks for coming.
"
44628,"Somebody called about a monkey?
"
44629,"Oh. Oh, you know what?
"
44630,"That was a complete misunderstanding.
"
44631,"Yeah, we thought we had a monkey,
"
44632,"but we didn't.
"
44633,"- It turned out it was a hat.
"
44634,"- Cat.
"
44635,"Cat. What did I say?
"
44636,"Hi. We checked
"
44637,"the third and fourth floor.
"
44638,"- No one's seen Marcel.
"
44639,"- Marcel?
"
44640,"My uncle Marcel.
"
44641,"Oh, is that who the monkey's
"
44642,"named after?
"
44643,"Okay.
"
44644,"Are you aware that possession
"
44645,"of an illegal exotic is punishable...
"
44646,"...by up to two years in prison
"
44647,"and confiscation of the animal.

"
44649,"Oh, my God.
"
44650,"You'd put that poor little creature in jail?
"
44651,"Pheebs, you remember how we talked about
"
44652,"saying things quietly to yourself first?
"
44653,"Yes, but there isn't always time.
"
44654,"Look, I'm sure there's some friendly way
"
44655,"to reconcile this. Um, have a seat.
"
44656,"First of all, we haven't been introduced.

"
44668,"RACHEL: No.
"
44669,"Not at all.
"
44670,"Well, maybe that's because
"
44671,"you spent four years ignoring me.
"
44672,"Would it have been so hard to say,
"
44673,"""Morning, Luisa""...
"
44674,"...or ""Nice overalls""?
"
44675,"Oh, I'm so sorry.
"

"
44718,"Uh, weren't we kind of in the middle

44814,"Marcel.
"
44815,"What have you done to him?
"
44816,"That's my monkey. That's Patty.

44817,"Patty the monkey.
"
44818,"Are you insane?
"
44819,"- Come here, Marcel. Come on.
"
44820,"- Come here, Patty.
"
44821,"Come here, Marcel.
"
44822,"Come here, Patty.
"

"
44824,"Here, monkey.
"
44825,"Gotcha.
"
44826,"- Okay, give me my monkey back.
"
44827,"- That's my monkey.
"
44828,"You're gonna have to take this up
"
44829,"with the judge.
"
44830,"That's not my monkey.
"
44831,"Just the dress is mine.
"
44832,"You can send it back whenever.
"
44833,"- All right, I want my monkey.
"
44834,"- No.
"
44835,"- Oh, come on, Luisa.
"
44836,"- Sorry, prom queen.
"
44837,"You had to be a bitch in high school,
"
44838,"you couldn't have been fat.
"
44839,"All right, look, in high school,
"
44840,"I was the prom queen...
"
44841,"...and I was the homecoming queen
"
44842,"and the class president and you...
"
44843,"...were also there.
"
44844,"Look, if you take this monkey...
"
44845,"...I will lose one of the most
"
44846,"important people in my life.
"
44847,"You can hate me if you want,
"
44848,"but please do not punish him.
"
44849,"Come on, Luisa, you have a chance
"
44850,"to be the bigger person here.
"
44851,"Take it.
"
44852,"No.
"
44853,"All right.
"
44854,"Well, then how about I call
"
44855,"your supervisor and I tell her...
"
44856,"...that you shot my friend
"
44857,"in the ass with a dart.
"
44858,"Hey, it'll be nice to get this off finally,
"
44859,"won't it?
"
44860,"Or we can leave it on for now.
"
44861,"That's fine.
"
44862,"You know, with the right pair of pumps,
"
44863,"that would be a great little outfit.
"
44864,"Listen...
"
44865,"I'm sorry I was so hard on you before.
"
44866,"You know, I just...
"
44867,"No, Ross, come on. No, no. It was my fault.
"
44868,"I almost lost your...
"
44869,"No, no. Yeah, but you were the one
"
44870,"who got him back.
"
44871,"You know, you were great.
"
44872,"Hey, we still have that bottle of wine.
"
44873,"Are you in the mood for, uh...
"
44874,"...something grape?
"
44875,"- Sure, that would be good.
"
44876,"- All right, uh...
"
44877,"Oh.
"
44878,"The, uh... The neighbors
"
44879,"must be vacuuming.
"
44880,"[CLEARS THROAT]
"
44881,"Well, ah, as long as we're here...
"
44882,"...and not on the subject, um, ahem...
"
44883,"I was thinking about, uh...
"
44884,"...how mad we got at each other before.
"
44885,"And, um, I was thinking maybe
"
44886,"it was partially because of how we...
"
44887,"- Rachel?
"
44888,"- Barry?
"
44889,"I can't. I can't do it. I can't marry Mindy.
"
44890,"- I'm still in love with you.
"
44891,"- Oh!
"
44892,"We have got to start locking that door.
"
44893,"This is me in The Sound of Music.
"
44894,"- You see the von Trapp kids?
"
44895,"- No.
"
44896,"That's because I'm in front of them.
"
44897,"Yeah, I thought that was an alp.
"
44898,"Well, high school
"
44899,"was not my favorite time.
"
44900,"I don't know. I loved high school,
"
44901,"you know?
"
44902,"It was just, like, four years
"
44903,"of parties and dating and sex and...
"
44904,"Yeah, well, I went to boarding school
"
44905,"with 400 boys.
"
44906,"Any sex I had would've involved
"
44907,"a major lifestyle choice.
"
44908,"Gosh, doesn't it seem like
"
44909,"a million years ago?
"
44910,"Oh, oh, oh.
"
44911,"Oh, my butt cheek is waking up.
"
44912,"I can't believe
"
44913,"you would actually say that.
"
44914,"I would much rather be Mr. Peanut
"
44915,"than Mr. Salty.
"
44916,"No way. Mr. Salty is a sailor, all right?
"
44917,"He's gotta be, like,
"
44918,"the toughest snack there is.
"
44919,"I don't know. You don't
"
44920,"wanna mess with corn nuts.
"
44921,"They're crazy.
"
44922,"Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
"

"

"
44937,"...as one of the greatest
"
44938,"first dates of all time.
"
44939,"It was unbelievable.
"
44940,"We could totally be ourselves.
"
44941,"We didn't have to play any games.
"
44942,"- So have you called her yet?
"
44943,"- Let her know I like her? Are you insane?
"
44944,"Guys. It's gross.
"
44945,"It's the next day.
"
44946,"How needy do I wanna seem?
"

"

"
44950,"Oh.
"

"
44954,"God. Come on. Just do it.
"

"
44956,"Which, by the way,
"
44957,"is the real San Francisco treat.
"
44958,"- I got her machine.
"
44959,"- Her answering machine?
"
44960,"No, interestingly enough,
"
44961,"her leaf blower picked up.
"
44962,"So, um, why didn't you say anything?
"
44963,"Oh, no, no, no. Last time I left
"
44964,"a spontaneous message...
"
44965,"...I ended up using the phrase,
"
44966,"""Yes, indeed-io.""

"
44971,"Yeah, well, does he look upset?
"
44972,"Does he look like
"
44973,"he was just told to shove anything?
"
44974,"No. No, actually, he's smiling.
"
44975,"Oh, my God. Don't do that.
"
44976,"What? What? What?
"
44977,"That man across the street
"
44978,"just kicked that pigeon.

"

"
44985,"- Hey.
"
44986,"How'd it go?
"
44987,"You know, it was, uh...
"
44988,"It was actually really great.
"
44989,"Took me to lunch
"
44990,"at the Russian Tea Room.
"
44991,"I had that chicken, you know,
"
44992,"where you poke it and butter squirts out.
"
44993,"Not a good day for birds.
"
44994,"And then we took a walk to Bendel's.
"
44995,"And I told him not to, but he got me
"
44996,"a little bottle of Chanel.
"
44997,"That's nice. Now was that before
"
44998,"or after you told him...
"
44999,"...to stop calling, stop sending you flowers
"
45000,"and to generally leave you alone, huh?
"
45001,"Right. Well, we never actually got to that.
"
45002,"Oh, it was just so nice to see him again,
"
45003,"you know? It was...
"
45004,"It was comfortable and it was familiar.
"
45005,"It was just nice.
"

"
45010,"Duh. Where have you been?
"
45011,"Yeah, but it was different with him today.
"
45012,"He wasn't, like, Orthodontist Guy,
"
45013,"you know?
"
45014,"I mean, we had fun.
"
45015,"Is there anything wrong with that?
"
45016,"Yes.
"
45017,"- Why?
"
45018,"- I have my reasons.
"
45019,"Okay, how about the fact that
"
45020,"he's engaged to another woman...
"
45021,"...who just happens to be
"
45022,"your ex-best friend?
"
45023,"All right. All right, all right, all right.
"
45024,"I know it's stupid.
"
45025,"I'll go see him this afternoon
"
45026,"and I will just put an end to it.
"
45027,"Wow.
"

45029,"- Ha, ha.

45043,"Hey, I've been honing.
"
45044,"What was with the dishes?
"
45045,"Oh, uh, I wanted her to think
"
45046,"I might be in a restaurant...
"
45047,"...you know,
"
45048,"I might have some kind of life.
"
45049,"Like I haven't been sitting around here
"
45050,"honing for the last two hours?

"
45058,"We gotta do something
"
45059,"about that guy.
"
45060,"This morning, I caught him
"
45061,"looking into our apartment.
"
45062,"It creeps me out. I feel like I can't do stuff.
"
45063,"What kind of stuff?
"
45064,"Will you grow up?
"
45065,"I'm not talking about sexy stuff...
"
45066,"...but, like, when I'm cooking naked.
"
45067,"You cook naked?
"
45068,"Yeah, toast, oatmeal.
"
45069,"Nothing that spatters.
"
45070,"What are you looking at me for?
"
45071,"I didn't know that.
"
45072,"What's the matter?
"
45073,"Oh, I just...
"
45074,"Oh, Barry, this was not good.
"
45075,"No, it was. It was very, very good.
"
45076,"- What about Mindy?
"
45077,"- Oh, way better than Mindy.
"
45078,"No, not that.
"
45079,"I mean, what about you and Mindy?
"
45080,"Oh. If you want,
"
45081,"I'll just break it off with her.
"
45082,"No. No, no, no.

"
45111,"You know, you could call her machine,
"
45112,"and if she has a lot of beeps...
"
45113,"...that means she probably
"
45114,"didn't get her messages yet.

45239,"gonna call me back.
"
45240,"- Don't you have to pee?
"
45241,"- That's why I'm dancing.
"
45242,"- Mindy.
"
45243,"- Hey, you.
"
45244,"Hey, you.
"
45245,"So, what's up?
"
45246,"Um, we should really be sitting for this.
"
45247,"Hmm.
"
45248,"Sure we should.
"
45249,"[SIGHS]
"
45250,"- So...
"
45251,"- Now, I know things have been weird lately.
"
45252,"But you're my oldest friend,
"
45253,"except for Laurie Schaefer...
"
45254,"...who I don't talk to anymore...
"
45255,"...because she's bitter
"
45256,"that she lost the weight...
"
45257,"...and it turns out,
"
45258,"she doesn't have a pretty face.
"
45259,"Okay, I'm gonna just ask you this once,
"
45260,"and I want a straight answer.
"
45261,"Okay.
"
45262,"[SIGHS]
"
45263,"Will you be my maid of honor?
"
45264,"- Of course!
"
45265,"- Oh, that's so great!
"
45266,"It is! It is!
"
45267,"[BOTH SCREAMING]
"
45268,"- Is that all you wanted to ask?
"
45269,"- That's all.
"
45270,"[BOTH SHOUTING]
"
45271,"[CRYING]
"
45272,"What? What?
"
45273,"That's not all.
"
45274,"- Oh, sure it is.
"
45275,"- Oh, no, it isn't. No.
"
45276,"I think Barry's seeing someone
"
45277,"in the city.
"
45278,"What would make you think that?
"
45279,"Well, ever since we announced
"
45280,"the engagement, he's acted weird.
"
45281,"And then last night, he came home
"
45282,"smelling like Chanel.
"
45283,"Really?
"
45284,"Mindy, if it'll make you feel any better...
"
45285,"...when Barry and I got engaged,
"
45286,"he went through a weird thing too.
"
45287,"Oh, God.
"
45288,"You see, that's what I was afraid of.
"
45289,"- What? What's what you were afraid of?
"
45290,"- Okay, okay.
"
45291,"When Barry was engaged to you,
"
45292,"he and I...
"
45293,"...kind of had a little thing on the side.
"
45294,"- What?
"
45295,"- I know, I know.
"
45296,"When he proposed to me,
"
45297,"everyone said, ""Don't do it.
"
45298,"He's gonna do to you what he did
"
45299,"to Rachel."" And now I feel so stupid.
"
45300,"Ha, ha.
"
45301,"Hmm. Oh, Mindy.
"
45302,"Oh, you are so stupid.
"
45303,"Oh, we are both so stupid.
"
45304,"What do you mean?
"
45305,"- Smell familiar?
"
45306,"MINDY: Oh, no.
"
45307,"RACHEL:
"
45308,"Mm-hm.
"
45309,"Oh, I'm so sorry.
"
45310,"Oh, no, me. I am so sorry.
"
45311,"No, I am sorry. I'm sorry.
"
45312,"Oh, my.
"
45313,"Four letters, ""circle or hoop.""
"
45314,"Ring, damn it, ring.
"
45315,"Thanks.
"
45316,"You know our phone's not working?
"
45317,"What?
"
45318,"I tried to call you from the coffee shop.
"
45319,"There was no answer.
"
45320,"I turned it off.
"
45321,"Mother of God, I turned it off.
"
45322,"Just like you told her you did.
"
45323,"Just pointing out the irony.
"
45324,"So listen, I went across the street
"
45325,"and talked to the doorman.
"
45326,"I got the peeper's name.
"
45327,"Can I use the phone?
"
45328,"[GRUNTS]
"
45329,"Can I use your phone?
"
45330,"Yeah, the number
"
45331,"for a Sidney Marks, please.
"
45332,"""Heating device.""
"
45333,"Radiator.
"
45334,"Five letters.
"
45335,"""Rdtor.""
"
45336,"Yeah, is Sidney there?
"
45337,"Oh, this is?
"
45338,"- Sidney's a woman.
"
45339,"- So she's a woman, so what?
"
45340,"Yeah, yeah, so what?
"
45341,"Look, I live across the street...
"
45342,"...and I know all about you
"
45343,"and your telescope.
"
45344,"And I don't appreciate it, okay?
"
45345,"Yeah, I can see you right now. Hello?
"
45346,"Look, if I wanna walk around my apartment
"
45347,"in my underwear...
"
45348,"...I shouldn't have to feel like...
"
45349,"Thank you.
"
45350,"That's not really the point.
"
45351,"The point is, that...
"
45352,"- Mostly free-weights, but occasionally...
"
45353,"- Joey.
"
45354,"Yeah, my neighbor. Yeah, the brunette.
"
45355,"She said you looked pretty that day
"
45356,"in the green dress.
"
45357,"The green dress? Really?
"
45358,"She said you looked like Ingrid Bergman
"
45359,"that day.
"
45360,"Heh. No.
"
45361,"[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
"
45362,"- Hey.
"
45363,"- Hey.
"
45364,"- You got a second?
"
45365,"- Sure, sure.
"
45366,"Come on...
"
45367,"...in.
"
45368,"Hello, sweetheart.
"
45369,"- What you guys doing here?
"
45370,"- Uh, we are here to break up with you.
"
45371,"Both of you?
"
45372,"We think you're a horrible human being,
"
45373,"and bad things should happen to you.
"
45374,"I'm sorry. I'm sorry. God, I am so sorry.
"
45375,"I'm an idiot. I was weak.
"
45376,"I couldn't help myself.
"
45377,"Whatever I did, I only did
"
45378,"because I love you so much.
"
45379,"Uh, which one of us
"
45380,"are you talking to there, Bar?
"
45381,"Um...
"
45382,"Mindy.
"
45383,"Mindy, of course, Mindy.
"
45384,"It was always Mindy.
"
45385,"Even when we were having sex
"
45386,"in that chair?
"
45387,"I swear, look, whatever I was doing,
"
45388,"I was always thinking of you.
"
45389,"Oh, please.
"
45390,"During that second time, you couldn't
"
45391,"have picked her out of a lineup.
"
45392,"You did it twice?
"
45393,"Well, the first time didn't really count.
"
45394,"You know, it was Barry.
"
45395,"Oh, right.
"
45396,"Honey, baby, sweetheart, look...
"
45397,"Just give me another chance, okay?
"
45398,"We'll start all over again.
"
45399,"We'll go back to Aruba.
"
45400,"What do you say?
"
45401,"BERNICE [OVER INTERCOM]:
"
45402,"Dr. Farber, we've got an emergency here.
"
45403,"Jason Castalano's
"
45404,"choking on his retainer.
"
45405,"Oh, God. Uh, I'll be right there, Bernice.
"
45406,"Look, please,
"
45407,"please don't go anywhere, okay?
"
45408,"- I'll be right back.
"
45409,"- Okay.
"
45410,"Okay, and we'll be here, hating you.
"
45411,"See how he was sweating
"
45412,"when he walked out of here?
"
45413,"If I'm hogging the ball,
"
45414,"you jump right in there...
"
45415,"...and take a couple of punches.
"
45416,"Because I'm telling you, this feels great.
"
45417,"Yeah, I'm pretty sure
"
45418,"I'm still gonna marry him.
"
45419,"What are you talking about?
"
45420,"Mindy, the guy is the devil.
"
45421,"He is Satan in a smock.
"
45422,"Look, I know he's not perfect.
"
45423,"[GRUNTS]
"
45424,"But the truth is,
"
45425,"at the end of the day...
"
45426,"...I still really wanna be...
"
45427,"...Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber...
"
45428,"...D.D.S.
"
45429,"Oh, God.
"
45430,"I hope you can find some way
"
45431,"to be happy for me.
"
45432,"And I hope you'll still be
"
45433,"my maid of honor.
"
45434,"And I hope Barry doesn't kill you
"
45435,"and eat you in Aruba.
"
45436,"You okay?
"
45437,"Yeah.
"
45438,"Really?
"
45439,"Yeah.
"
45440,"You know, ever since I ran out on Barry
"
45441,"at the wedding...
"
45442,"...I have wondered
"
45443,"whether I made the right choice.
"
45444,"Oh. And now I know.
"
45445,"MONICA:
"
45446,"I'm so glad.
"
45447,"Big day.
"
45448,"All right, I'll give you this:
"
45449,"Mr. Peanut is a better dresser.
"
45450,"I mean, he's got the monocle,
"
45451,"he's got the top hat...
"
45452,"Did you know he's gay?
"
45453,"I just wanna clarify this.
"
45454,"Are you outing Mr. Peanut?
"
45455,"- Chandler?
"
45456,"- Danielle, hi.
"
45457,"Everybody, this is Danielle.
"
45458,"Danielle, everybody.
"
45459,"GROUP:
"
45460,"Hi.
"
45461,"- What are you doing here?
"
45462,"- I've been calling you...
"
45463,"...but it turns out
"
45464,"I had your number wrong.
"
45465,"And when I finally got the right one
"
45466,"from Information, there was no answer.
"
45467,"So I thought I'd just come down here
"
45468,"and make sure you were okay.
"
45469,"Oh, uh, I'm okay.
"
45470,"Listen, uh, maybe we could
"
45471,"get together later?
"
45472,"That sounds good. I'll call you.
"
45473,"Or you call me, whatever.
"
45474,"- You know.
"
45475,"- Ha, ha.
"
45476,"- You got it.
"
45477,"CHANDLER: Okay.
"
45478,"- Bye, everybody.
"
45479,"GROUP: Bye.
"
45480,"Woo-hoo! Yeah, there you go.
"
45481,"Second date.
"
45482,"I don't know.
"
45483,"RACHEL:
"
45484,"You don't know?
"
45485,"Oh, she seems nice, but that thing
"
45486,"about her coming all the way here...
"
45487,"...just to see if I was okay?
"
45488,"I mean, how needy is that?
"
45489,"[ALL GROANING]
"
45490,"How'd someone get
"
45491,"your credit card number?
"
45492,"I have no idea.
"
45493,"Look how much they spent!
"
45494,"Calm down. You only have to pay
"
45495,"for the stuff you bought.
"
45496,"Still, it's just such reckless spending.
"
45497,"When somebody steals your credit card...
"
45498,"...they've kind of already
"
45499,"thrown caution to the wind.
"
45500,"Wow, what a geek.
"
45501,"They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop.
"
45502,"That's me.
"
45503,"Oh! Oh, the yuck.
"
45504,"He's doing it again!
"
45505,"Marcel, stop humping the lamp!
"
45506,"Stop humping!
"
45507,"Now, Marcel, come back!
"
45508,"Come here, Marcel!
"
45509,"Oh, no, no! Not in my room!
"
45510,"I'll get him.
"
45511,"You've got to do something
"
45512,"about the humping.
"
45513,"What? It's just a phase.
"
45514,"Well, that's what we said about Joey.
"
45515,"Hey, would you all relax?
"
45516,"It's not that big a deal.
"
45517,"RACHEL:
"
45518,"Marcel, stop it! Marcel! Bad monkey!
"
45519,"- What?
"
45520,"RACHEL: Ugh!
"
45521,"Let's just say my Curious George doll
"
45522,"is no longer curious.
"
45523,"Ugh, Monica, you are not still
"
45524,"going over that thing.
"
45525,"- This woman's living my life.
"
45526,"- What?
"
45527,"She's living my life,
"
45528,"and she's doing it better than me.
"
45529,"Look at this. Look.
"
45530,"She buys tickets to plays I want to see.
"
45531,"She shops at stores that
"
45532,"I'm intimidated by the salespeople.
"
45533,"She spent $300 on art supplies.
"
45534,"You're not an artist.
"
45535,"Yeah, well, I might be
"
45536,"if I had the supplies.
"
45537,"I mean, I could do all this stuff.
"
45538,"Only I don't.
"
45539,"Oh, Monica, come on.
"
45540,"You do cool things.
"
45541,"Oh, really? Let's compare, shall we?
"
45542,"Oh, it's so late for ""shall we?""
"
45543,"Do I go horseback riding
"
45544,"in the park, hmm?
"
45545,"Do I take classes at The New School?
"
45546,"- No.
"
45547,"- No.
"
45548,"This is so unfair.
"
45549,"She's got everything I want,
"
45550,"and she doesn't have my mother.
"
45551,"How about Joey Paponi?
"
45552,"No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks
"
45553,"I should have a name that's more neutral.
"
45554,"Joey Switzerland?
"
45555,"Plus I think it should be Joe.
"
45556,"Joey makes me sound like I'm...
"
45557,"...this big.
"
45558,"Which I'm not!
"
45559,"Joe, Joe, Joe... Stalin?
"
45560,"Stalin.
"
45561,"Do I know that name?
"
45562,"That sounds familiar.
"
45563,"- Well, it does not ring a bell with me.
"
45564,"- Huh.
"
45565,"Joe Stalin.
"
45566,"You know, that's pretty good.
"
45567,"- You might want to try Joseph.
"
45568,"- Ah!
"
45569,"Joseph Stalin!
"
45570,"- I think you'd remember that!
"
45571,"- Oh, yes!
"
45572,"Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin.
"
45573,"Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof.
"
45574,"- Hey.
"
45575,"- Hey.
"
45576,"Hi.
"
45577,"Hi. Uh, yes, this is Monica Geller.
"
45578,"Um, I'm taking classes with you,
"
45579,"and I was wondering what they were.
"
45580,"What are you doing?
"
45581,"All right, great.
"
45582,"Great. Thanks a lot.
"
45583,"I'm going to tap class.
"
45584,"So you can dance with the woman
"
45585,"that stole your card?
"
45586,"She's got my life.
"
45587,"I want to see who she is.
"
45588,"Go to the post office!
"
45589,"I'm sure her picture's up!
"
45590,"Honey, you're kind of losing it here.
"
45591,"This is really becoming
"
45592,"a weird obsession.
"
45593,"This is madness, I tell you.
"
45594,"For the love of God, Monica, don't do it!
"
45595,"Thank you.
"
45596,"What do you think?
"
45597,"Lots of things.
"
45598,"Which one do you think she is?
"
45599,"- May I help you?
"
45600,"- Oh, no, thanks.
"
45601,"We're just here to observe.
"
45602,"You don't observe a dance class.
"
45603,"You dance a dance class!
"
45604,"Spare shoes are over there.
"
45605,"What does she mean?
"
45606,"I think she means, ""You dance...
"
45607,"...a dance class!""
"
45608,"Come on, come on, come on!
"
45609,"RACHEL:
"
45610,"Really?
"
45611,"Hey, do you see anybody
"
45612,"you think could be me?
"
45613,"People, last time there were yogurt containers
"
45614,"lying around after class.
"
45615,"Let's not have that happen again!
"
45616,"She could be you.
"
45617,"Let's get started.
"
45618,"Five, six. Five, six, seven, eight.
"
45619,"Okay, I'm not getting this!
"
45620,"I'm totally getting it!
"
45621,"Do you ever just feel like you're
"
45622,"so unbelievably uncoordinated?
"
45623,"What? You just click when they click.
"
45624,"All right.
"
45625,"Now everyone grab a partner.
"
45626,"Oh! Oh.
"
45627,"All right. And my dead mother
"
45628,"said you are it! I'm with Rachel.
"
45629,"Great, it's gym class all over again.
"
45630,"RACHEL & PHOEBE:
"
45631,"Aww.
"
45632,"That's all right. You can come up
"
45633,"to the front and dance with me.
"
45634,"Why don't I just take off my clothes
"
45635,"and have a nightmare?
"
45636,"It's okay, it's okay!
"
45637,"I'm here, I'm here. I'm so sorry I'm late.
"
45638,"Okay, here I am.
"
45639,"So who's the new tense girl?
"
45640,"She's your partner.
"
45641,"- Hi, I'm Monica.
"
45642,"- Hi.
"
45643,"Oh, ha.
"
45644,"Monica.
"
45645,"Hi, I'm Mon...

45646,"Nana.
"
45647,"- Monana?
"
45648,"- Yeah.
"
45649,"It's Dutch.
"
45650,"You're kidding.
"
45651,"I spent three years in Amsterdam.
"
45652,"[SPEAKING IN DUTCH]
"
45653,"Um, Pennsylvania Dutch.
"
45654,"And we're dancing!
"
45655,"Five, six, seven, eight.
"
45656,"Hi.
"
45657,"- Hey.
"
45658,"- Hey.
"
45659,"- Where have you been?
"
45660,"- I just got back from the vet.
"
45661,"She's not gonna make you wear
"
45662,"a big plastic cone, is she?
"
45663,"She says Marcel's humping thing
"
45664,"is not a phase.
"
45665,"Apparently, he's reached sexual maturity.
"
45666,"Hey, he beat you!
"
45667,"She says, as time goes on,
"
45668,"he'll start getting aggressive and violent.
"
45669,"What does this mean?
"
45670,"I have to give him up.
"
45671,"I can't believe it. This sucks!
"
45672,"You just got him.
"
45673,"How could he be an adult already?
"
45674,"I know, I know.
"
45675,"One day he's this little thing...
"
45676,"...and before you know it,
"
45677,"he's this little thing...
"
45678,"...I can't get off my leg.
"
45679,"Isn't there any way you can keep him?
"
45680,"No. No.
"
45681,"The vet said that unless he's in a place
"
45682,"where he has regular access...
"
45683,"...to some monkey loving...
"
45684,"...he's just gonna get vicious.
"
45685,"I just gotta get him into a zoo.
"
45686,"- How do you get a monkey into a zoo?
"
45687,"- I know that one!
"
45688,"No, that's popes into a Volkswagen.
"
45689,"We're applying to a lot of them.
"
45690,"Our first choice would be a state zoo.
"
45691,"You know, like, uh, San Diego.
"
45692,"Right?
"
45693,"But that may just be a pipe dream
"
45694,"because he's out-of-state.
"
45695,"My vet knows someone at Miami,
"
45696,"so that's a possibility.
"
45697,"But that's two blocks from the beach.
"
45698,"It's a total party zoo.
"
45699,"- Hey.
"
45700,"CHANDLER: Hey.
"
45701,"- Hi.
"
45702,"- We found the girl!
"
45703,"- What?
"
45704,"- Did you call the cops?
"
45705,"Nope. We took her to lunch.
"
45706,"Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice.
"
45707,"Are you insane?
"
45708,"This woman stole from you!
"
45709,"She stole! She's a stealer!
"
45710,"After you're with this woman
"
45711,"for 10 minutes, you forget all that.
"
45712,"I mean, she's this astounding person...
"
45713,"...with this amazing spirit!
"
45714,"Yeah, which she probably stole
"
45715,"from some cheerleader!
"
45716,"- Take off their hats.
"
45717,"- Popes in a Volkswagen!
"
45718,"Mm-hm.
"
45719,"I love that joke.
"
45720,"- No way! No way did you do this!
"
45721,"- Monana was very brave.
"
45722,"It was so wild.
"
45723,"We told them we were
"
45724,"the Gunnersons in room 615...
"
45725,"...only to find out the Boston Celtics
"
45726,"had the entire sixth floor!
"
45727,"So when they caught on to the fact
"
45728,"that we're short and have breasts...
"
45729,"They threw us out.
"
45730,"I was thrown out of a hotel! Me!
"
45731,"Go, Monana!
"
45732,"Well, you ladies are not
"
45733,"the only ones living the dream.
"
45734,"I get to go pour coffee for people
"
45735,"I don't know. Don't wait up.
"
45736,"Oh, by the way...
"
45737,"...tomorrow we're auditioning
"
45738,"for a Broadway show.
"
45739,"Excuse me?
"
45740,"There's an open call for Cats.
"
45741,"I'm thinking we go down there,
"
45742,"sing ""Memories""...
"
45743,"...and make complete fools of ourselves.
"
45744,"What do you say?
"
45745,"No, no, no.
"
45746,"Remember who
"
45747,"you're dealing with here. Ha.
"
45748,"I'm not like you. I can't even
"
45749,"stand in front of a tap class.
"
45750,"That's because of
"
45751,"your Amish background.
"
45752,"- What?
"
45753,"- Well, you're Pennsylvania Dutch, right?
"
45754,"Right.
"
45755,"Till I bought a blow dryer.
"
45756,"Then I was shunned.
"
45757,"I was just like you.
"
45758,"And then one day, I saw a movie
"
45759,"that changed my life.
"
45760,"- Did you ever see Dead Poets Society?
"
45761,"- Uh-huh.
"
45762,"I thought that movie was so incredibly...
"
45763,"...boring!
"
45764,"I mean, that thing at the end
"
45765,"where the kid...
"
45766,"...kills himself because
"
45767,"he can't be in the play?
"
45768,"What was that?
"
45769,"It's like, ""Kid, wait a year.
"
45770,"Leave home, do some community theater!""
"
45771,"I walked out of there, and I thought:
"
45772,"""Now, that's two hours of my life
"
45773,"that I'm never getting back!""
"
45774,"And that scared me more than
"
45775,"all the other crap I was afraid to do.
"
45776,"Wow.
"
45777,"Then I would definitely
"
45778,"not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire.
"
45779,"[LAUGHING]
"
45780,"Oh, God.
"
45781,"We didn't get into Scranton.
"
45782,"That was our safety zoo.
"
45783,"They take, like, dogs and cows.
"
45784,"See?
"
45785,"I don't know who this
"
45786,"is harder on, me or him.
"
45787,"I'd say that chair's taking the brunt of it.
"
45788,"ROSS:
"
45789,"Marcel. Marcel.
"
45790,"Marcel, no.
"
45791,"Good boy!
"
45792,"See? How can nobody want him?
"
45793,"Somebody will.
"
45794,"You know there already is a Joseph Stalin?
"
45795,"You're kidding!
"
45796,"Apparently, he was this Russian dictator
"
45797,"who slaughtered all these people!
"
45798,"- You'd think you would've known that!
"
45799,"- You'd think I would've.
"
45800,"Phoebe, what do you think
"
45801,"a good stage name for me would be?
"
45802,"[CLEARS THROAT]
"
45803,"Flame Boy!
"
45804,"Where exactly is your zoo?
"
45805,"Well, it's technically not a zoo per se.
"
45806,"It's, uh, more of an interactive
"
45807,"wildlife experience.
"
45808,"Let me ask you some questions about...
"
45809,"Is it, uh, Marcel?
"
45810,"- Yes.
"
45811,"- Yes. Uh...
"
45812,"Does he, uh, fight with other animals?
"
45813,"No, no. He's very docile.
"
45814,"Hmm. Even if he were cornered?
"
45815,"Well, I don't know. Why?
"
45816,"Um, how is he at handling small objects?
"
45817,"He can hold a banana,
"
45818,"if that's what you mean.
"
45819,"What about a hammer or a small blade?
"
45820,"[STAMMERS]
"
45821,"Why would he need a blade?
"
45822,"If he's up against a jungle cat
"
45823,"or an animal with horns...
"
45824,"...you got to give
"
45825,"the little guy something.
"
45826,"Otherwise, it's just cruel!
"
45827,"[PANTING]
"
45828,"He got into San Diego!
"
45829,"- What?
"
45830,"- Yeah.
"
45831,"We were coming back from our walk,
"
45832,"and the phone was ringing...
"
45833,"- He's in!
"
45834,"- He's in? Ah!
"
45835,"Did you hear that, Marcel?
"
45836,"San Diego! San Diego! Yeah!
"
45837,"You're making a mistake.
"
45838,"San Diego's well and good...
"
45839,"...but if you give him to me,
"
45840,"I'll start him against a blind rabbit...
"
45841,"...and give you 20 percent of the gate.
"
45842,"Yo-ho!
"
45843,"Where have you been?
"
45844,"Monica and I just crashed
"
45845,"an embassy party.
"
45846,"Are you drunk?
"
45847,"No!
"
45848,"I'm lying.
"
45849,"I am so drunk!
"
45850,"Oh, God!
"
45851,"Ugh. Great. You know what?
"
45852,"You could have called.
"
45853,"I've been up here. I've been worried...
"
45854,"Monica.
"
45855,"Monica?
"
45856,"Water rules!
"
45857,"Yes. Yes, it does.
"
45858,"The restaurant called.
"
45859,"They want to know if you're showing up.
"
45860,"Nope!
"
45861,"I'm going to the Big Apple Circus today.
"
45862,"What are you doing?
"
45863,"You're gonna lose your job. This is not you!
"
45864,"No, it is me!
"
45865,"I'm not just the person
"
45866,"who needs to fluff the pillows...
"
45867,"...and pay the bills as soon as they come in!
"
45868,"You know, when I'm with her,
"
45869,"I'm so much more than that!
"
45870,"I'm...
"
45871,"I'm Monana!
"
45872,"[PHONE RINGING]
"
45873,"Ahem, hello?
"
45874,"Yes, she is. Hold on a second, please.
"
45875,"Ahem, Monana, it's for you.
"
45876,"The credit card people.
"
45877,"Hello?
"
45878,"Yes?
"
45879,"Oh, my God!
"
45880,"Thanks.
"
45881,"What?
"
45882,"They've arrested Monica.
"
45883,"- Hi.
"
45884,"- Hey.
"
45885,"How are you?
"
45886,"I'm not too bad.
"
45887,"Fortunately, blue's my color.
"
45888,"How did you know I was here?
"
45889,"Because...
"
45890,"...I'm Monica Geller.
"
45891,"It was my credit card you were using.
"
45892,"That I was not expecting.
"
45893,"I want you to know, I didn't turn you in.
"
45894,"Oh.
"
45895,"- Thanks.
"
45896,"- No, thank you.
"
45897,"You have given me so much.
"
45898,"If it wasn't for you,
"
45899,"I'd never have gotten...
"
45900,"...to sing ""Memories""
"
45901,"at the Winter Garden Theater.
"
45902,"Actually, you only got to sing ""Memo...""
"
45903,"I can't believe you're in here.
"
45904,"What am I gonna do without you?
"
45905,"Who's gonna crash
"
45906,"the embassy parties with me?
"
45907,"Who's gonna take me
"
45908,"to the Big Apple Circus?
"
45909,"Monica, I started my day by peeing
"
45910,"in front of 25 other women...
"
45911,"...and you're worried about who will
"
45912,"take you to the Big Apple Circus?
"
45913,"Well, not worried,
"
45914,"you know, just wondering.
"
45915,"There's nothing to wonder about.
"
45916,"You'll go back to being who you were
"
45917,"because that's who you are.
"
45918,"- Not necessarily.
"
45919,"- Yes, necessarily.
"
45920,"I don't know what it is.
"
45921,"Maybe it's the Amish thing.
"
45922,"Um, I'm not actually Amish.
"
45923,"Really? Then why are you like that?
"
45924,"You by the door, in or out?
"
45925,"In!
"
45926,"You in the back, you're getting it wrong!
"
45927,"At least I'm doing it!
"
45928,"WOMAN [OVER PA]: This is the final
"
45929,"boarding call for Flight 67 to San Diego...
"
45930,"...boarding at Gate 42A.
"
45931,"Okay, goodbye, little monkey guy.
"
45932,"- I wrote you this poem.
"
45933,"- Aw.
"
45934,"Okay, but don't eat it
"
45935,"till you get on the plane.
"
45936,"- Thank you, Aunt Phoebe.
"
45937,"- Aww.
"
45938,"Okay, bye, champ.
"
45939,"There's gonna be a lot of babes
"
45940,"in San Diego...
"
45941,"...but remember, there's also a lot to learn.
"
45942,"I don't know what to say, Ross.
"
45943,"Uh, it's a monkey.
"
45944,"Just say what you feel, Joey.
"
45945,"Marcel, I'm hungry.
"
45946,"ROSS:
"
45947,"That was good.
"
45948,"- Marcel, this is for you.
"
45949,"- Oh.
"
45950,"It's, uh, just, you know,
"
45951,"something to, um...
"
45952,"...do on the plane.
"
45953,"If you don't mind,
"
45954,"I'd like a moment, just me and him.
"
45955,"- Sure.
"
45956,"- Of course. Absolutely.
"
45957,"ALL:
"
45958,"Oh.
"
45959,"Marcel, come here. Come here.
"
45960,"Come here.
"
45961,"Well, buddy...
"
45962,"...this is it.
"
45963,"There's just a couple of things
"
45964,"I wanted to say.
"
45965,"I'm really gonna miss you.
"
45966,"You know? And I'm never gonna
"
45967,"forget about you.
"
45968,"You've been more than just a pet to me.
"
45969,"You've been more like a...
"
45970,"Okay. Marcel, would you...?
"
45971,"Marcel, would you leave my leg alone?
"
45972,"Would you just stop humping me
"
45973,"for two seconds? Marc... Would you...?
"
45974,"Okay, would you just take him away?
"
45975,"Just take him.
"
45976,"O! That I were a glove
"
45977,"upon that hand...
"
45978,"...that I might touch thy cheek.
"
45979,"WOMAN:
"
45980,"That's fine. Thank you.
"
45981,"MAN:
"
45982,"Next.
"
45983,"Hi. Uh, I'll be reading
"
45984,"for the role of Mercutio.
"
45985,"MAN: Name?
"
45986,"- Holden McGroin.
"
45987,"MONICA: Tell him. Please tell him.
"
45988,"- Tell him.
"
45989,"- Shut up.
"
45990,"- Tell me what?
"
45991,"MONICA: You won't even look at him.
"
45992,"- Oh, come on, tell me.
"
45993,"I could use another reason
"
45994,"why women won't look at me.
"
45995,"All right, all right, all right.
"
45996,"Last night, I had a dream...
"
45997,"...that, um, you and I were, uh...
"
45998,"Doing it on this table.
"
45999,"- Wow.
"
46000,"- Excellent dream score.
"
46001,"Why...? Why would you dream that?
"
46002,"More importantly, was I any good?
"
46003,"Well, you were pretty damned good.
"
46004,"Ha, ha.
"
46005,"Interesting, because in my dreams,
"
46006,"I'm surprisingly inadequate.
"
46007,"Well, last night, you seemed to know
"
46008,"your way around the table.
"
46009,"[ROSS CHUCKLES]
"
46010,"I love it when we share.
"
46011,"CHANDLER:
"
46012,"You okay there?
"
46013,"I can't believe you two had sex
"
46014,"in her dream.
"
46015,"I'm sorry. It was a one-time thing.
"
46016,"I was very drunk,
"
46017,"and it was someone else's subconscious.
"
46018,"- Hello, Rachel.
"
46019,"- Ugh.
"
46020,"Get off.
"
46021,"Ooh. Oh, give me.
"
46022,"Can you see me operating a drill press?
"
46023,"I don't know. What are you wearing?
"
46024,"Pheebs, why would you want
"
46025,"to operate a drill press?
"
46026,"Just for some short-term work.
"
46027,"You know, till I get back
"
46028,"some of my massage clients.
"
46029,"Pirates again?
"
46030,"No. Nothing like that.
"
46031,"I'm just such a dummy.
"
46032,"I taught this
"
46033,"""Massage Yourself at Home"" workshop.
"
46034,"And they are.
"
46035,"Hey, hey, Chan, she could work for you.
"
46036,"Thanks, Joey. That's a good idea.
"
46037,"What? I could. I could do it. What is it?
"
46038,"Well, my secretary's gonna be out.
"
46039,"She's having one of her boobs reduced.
"
46040,"It's a whole big boob story.
"
46041,"I could be a secretary.
"
46042,"Well, I don't know
"
46043,"if it's your kind of thing...
"
46044,"...because, uh,
"
46045,"it involves a lot of being normal...
"
46046,"...ahem, for a large portion of the day.
"
46047,"I could do that.
"
46048,"[BEEPER BEEPING]
"
46049,"- What are you playing with?
"
46050,"- It's my new beeper.
"
46051,"Why the hell does a paleontologist
"
46052,"need a beeper for?
"
46053,"Is it, like, for dinosaur emergencies?
"
46054,"""Help, come quick! They're still extinct!""
"
46055,"[CHANDLER LAUGHS]
"
46056,"No, it's for when Carol goes into labor.
"
46057,"She can get me wherever I am.
"
46058,"All she has to do is dial 55-JIMBO.
"
46059,"A cool phone number
"
46060,"and a possible name for the kid.
"
46061,"- I'll see you guys later.
"
46062,"- Off to see young Ethan?
"
46063,"Thank you.
"
46064,"How young is young Ethan? Young?
"
46065,"He's our age.
"
46066,"When we were?
"
46067,"- Okay, he's a senior in college.
"
46068,"- College?
"
46069,"JOEY: Ooh.
"
46070,"- Whoa.
"
46071,"And this man-child has no problem
"
46072,"with how old you are?
"
46073,"No, of course not.
"
46074,"It's not even an issue...
"
46075,"...because I told him I was 22.
"
46076,"- What?
"
46077,"- What?
"
46078,"- Oh, I can't pass for 22?
"
46079,"- Well, maybe 25, 26.
"
46080,"- I am 26.
"
46081,"- There you go.
"
46082,"[PHONE RINGING]
"
46083,"Can you hear that?
"
46084,"Yeah. Ha, ha.
"
46085,"That'll stop when you pick up the phone.

46086,"Oh. Ha, ha.

"
46094,"Will he know what this is in reference to?
"
46095,"And he has your number?
"
46096,"All right, I'll see that he gets the message.

46097,"Bye-bye.

46098,"- What?
"
46099,"- [IN NORMAL VOICE] Ross says hi.
"
46100,"Ah.
"
46101,"This is so fun.
"
46102,"All right, what do we do now?
"
46103,"Well, now I actually have to get to work.

"
46117,"Did I turn the fish?
"
46118,"Nope, because I made lasagna.
"
46119,"- Am I out of control?
"
46120,"- Just a touch.
"
46121,"Mon, I don't understand.
"
46122,"I mean, you've been dating this guy since,
"

46135,"- Yeah.
"

"

"
46165,"- Me.
"
46166,"- Ah.
"
46167,"- I didn't tell anybody that I knew you.

"
46230,"...there's something you should know.
"
46231,"Okay. Is this like
"
46232,"""I have an early class tomorrow""...
"
46233,"...or ""I'm secretly married to a goat""?

"
46236,"of course, I'm not, uh...
"
46237,"Well, I mean, I haven't ever, um...
"
46238,"- Ethan?
"
46239,"- Yeah?
"
46240,"Are you a virgin?
"
46241,"Well, if that's what you kids
"
46242,"are calling it these days...
"
46243,"...then yes, I am.
"
46244,"I, uh... I've kind of been waiting

46258,"[ETHAN MOANING]
"
46259,"Listen, listen.
"
46260,"Um, you told me something

"
46272,"I'm 25.
"
46273,"And 13 months.
"
46274,"Huh.
"

"

"
46278,"how old we are?
"
46279,"Listen, um...
"
46280,"...as long as we're telling stuff, uh...
"
46281,"...I have another one for you.
"
46282,"I'm a little younger than I said.

46283,"You're not a senior?
"
46284,"Oh, I'm a senior.
"
46285,"In high school.
"
46286,"Okay.
"
46287,"What we did was wrong.
"
46288,"Oh, God. I just had sex with someone
"
46289,"who wasn't alive during the bicentennial.
"
46290,"I just had sex.
"
46291,"Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me?
"
46292,"- You never told me how old you were.
"
46293,"- That's different.
"
46294,"My lie didn't make one of us a felon

46326,"- You sure?
"
46327,"Nobody, uh, handing out mints
"
46328,"or anything?
"
46329,"No, it was just the three of us.
"
46330,"Oh.
"

"
46332,"and then you and me...
"
46333,"...or you and me and Chandler?

"
46353,"sometimes just things don't work out.
"

"
46384,"A month ago, these people were my friends.
"
46385,"Just because I'm in charge,
"
46386,"doesn't mean I'm a different person.

"
46402,"- Mm-hm.
"
46403,"- Ha, ha.
"
46404,"You were great.
"
46405,"But they still made fun of you.
"
46406,"- What?
"
46407,"- Now you're more like Mr. Caring-Boss.

46411,"Then I don't get it.
"
46412,"Well, you know what, Chandler?
"

"

"
46423,"- No, but you can't.
"
46424,"- But I just want...

"
46426,"[BEEPER BEEPING]
"
46427,"Aren't you gonna...?
"
46428,"Oh, Carol and I have a new system.
"
46429,"If she punches in ""911,""
"
46430,"it means she's having a baby.
"

"
46432,"- What about Andre?
"
46433,"This morning he got a call
"
46434,"from what I think was our cousin Nathan.
"
46435,"And frankly,
"
46436,"it was a little more than I needed to know.
"
46437,"Hey.
"
46438,"That was gonna be my opener.
"
46439,"Hey, did you guys check out
"
46440,"those new hand dryers in the bathroom?

"
46443,"All right, look, I gotta tell you something.
"
46444,"I'm not 17.
"
46445,"I only said that
"
46446,"so you'd think I was cute and vulnerable.
"
46447,"I'm actually 30.
"
46448,"I have a wife. I have a job.
"
46449,"I'm your congressman.
"
46450,"Monica, this is ridiculous.
"
46451,"We are great together.
"
46452,"We can talk, we make each other laugh.
"
46453,"And the sex. Oh, man.
"
46454,"Okay, I have no frame of reference,
"
46455,"but I thought that was great.
"
46456,"- It was.
"
46457,"- Then what's the problem?
"
46458,"Ethan, it's, um...
"
46459,"It's icky.
"
46460,"Icky?
"
46461,"You're actually gonna throw this away
"
46462,"because it's icky?
"
46463,"Look, this isn't easy for me either.
"
46464,"I wish things were different.
"
46465,"If you were a few years older
"
46466,"or I was a few years younger...
"
46467,"...or we lived in biblical times...

"
46483,"SANTOS: Sure.
"
46484,"- No problem.
"
46485,"You have to give them something,
"
46486,"you know?
"
46487,"Okay, that was Gerston, Santos,
"
46488,"and who's the guy with the mustache?

46956,"growing up, you know, my dad left...
"
46957,"...and my mother died,
"
46958,"and my stepfather went to jail.
"
46959,"So I barely had enough pieces of parents
"
46960,"to make one whole one.
"
46961,"And here's this little baby
"
46962,"who has like three whole parents...
"
46963,"...who care about it so much that they fight
"
46964,"over who gets to love it the most...
"
46965,"...and it's not even born yet.
"
46966,"It's just the luckiest baby
"
46967,"in the whole world.
"
46968,"I'm sorry. You were fighting.
"
46969,"Where are they?
"
46970,"- I'm sure they'll be here soon.
"
46971,"- They wouldn't miss this.
"
46972,"Relax. You're only at nine centimeters,
"
46973,"and the baby's at zero station.
"
46974,"Okay, you are really frightening me.
"
46975,"[CAROL SCREAMS]
"
46976,"Somebody wanna help me?
"
46977,"Trying to rip out my heart.
"
46978,"Uh... Oh, that's great.
"
46979,"Anybody seen a nipple?
"
46980,"All right. Ten centimeters. Here we go.
"
46981,"- All right, honey, time to start pushing.
"
46982,"- But they're not here yet.
"
46983,"Sorry, I can't tell the baby
"
46984,"to wait for them.
"
46985,"Oh, God.
"
46986,"[ROSS GRUNTS]
"
46987,"Okay, got the vent open.
"
46988,"Hi, I'm Ben.
"
46989,"[CHUCKLES]
"
46990,"I'm hospital worker Ben.
"
46991,"It's Ben to the rescue.
"
46992,"- [SINGING] La, la, la
"
46993,"- Okay, okay, okay.
"
46994,"- Ben, you ready?
"
46995,"- Yeah.
"
46996,"- All right, give me your foot.
"
46997,"- Okay.
"
46998,"- Okay, on three, Ben. One, two, three. Unh.
"
46999,"PHOEBE: Ooh.
"
47000,"- Come on, Ben. Okay. That's it, Ben.
"
47001,"PHOEBE: Okay. Uh-huh.
"
47002,"SUSAN:
"
47003,"What do you see?
"
47004,"PHOEBE: Well, Susan,
"
47005,"I see what appears to be a dark vent.
"
47006,"Wait.
"
47007,"Yes, it is, in fact, a dark vent.
"
47008,"[ROSS & SUSAN GASPING]
"
47009,"Pheebs, it's open! It's open!
"
47010,"Wait! You forgot your legs!
"
47011,"ALL: Push. Push.
"
47012,"- We're here!
"
47013,"[ALL SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY]
"
47014,"ROSS: We're here.
"
47015,"- Where have you been?!
"
47016,"Long story, honey.
"
47017,"FRANZBLAU:
"
47018,"All right, Carol, I need you to keep pushing.
"
47019,"I need... Excuse me, can I have this?
"
47020,"Oh, sorry.
"
47021,"All right, all right.
"
47022,"There's too many people in this room.
"
47023,"There's about to be one more.
"
47024,"So anybody who's not an ex-husband
"
47025,"or a lesbian life partner, out you go.
"
47026,"- Come on, out.
"
47027,"RACHEL: Okay, good luck.
"
47028,"- Bye, bye, bye.
"
47029,"- Good luck, you guys, good luck.
"
47030,"Let me ask you, do you have to be
"
47031,"Carol's lesbian life partner?
"
47032,"NURSE:
"
47033,"Out.
"
47034,"FRANZBLAU: All right.
"
47035,"All right, he's crowning. Here he comes.

"
47037,"Oh... Oh.
"
47038,"Oh! A head.
"
47039,"Oh. It's huge.
"
47040,"Carol, how are you doing this?
"
47041,"Not helping.
"
47042,"FRANZBLAU:
"
47043,"You're doing great. You're doing fine.
"
47044,"- Hello?
"
47045,"- Oh, sorry.
"
47046,"What do you see? What do you see?
"
47047,"We got a head, we got shoulders,
"
47048,"we got arms, we got...
"
47049,"Oh, look at the little... The fingers.
"
47050,"Oh, a chest and a stomach...
"
47051,"...and it's a boy, definitely a boy.
"
47052,"All right. Okay, legs, knees and feet.
"
47053,"Oh, oh.
"
47054,"[GASPING]
"
47055,"He's here. He's...
"
47056,"He's a person.
"
47057,"Oh!
"
47058,"- Look at that.
"
47059,"- What does he look like?
"
47060,"Kind of like my Uncle Ed,
"

"
47062,"Really?

47064,"You guys, he's beautiful.
"
47065,"Aw, thanks, Pheebs.

47070,"Ben.
"
47071,"[BEN COOS]
"

"
47073,"- Yeah?
"
47074,"How come you never
"
47075,"mentioned Ben before?
"
47076,"- We, uh, just cooked it up.
"
47077,"SUSAN: Ha, ha.
"
47078,"That's what we were off doing.
"
47079,"- Hi.
"
47080,"- Hey.
"

"
47094,"SUSAN:
"
47095,"Thanks. Ha, ha.
"
47096,"Oh, God, I can't believe one of us
"
47097,"actually has one of these.
"
47098,"I know. I still am one of these.
"
47099,"- Ross?
"
47100,"ROSS: Yeah?
"
47101,"Can I?
"
47102,"Okay, the head, the head. You gotta...

"

"
47119,"But I'll still always come back...

"
47121,"And sometimes I'll want you to steal third,
"
47122,"and I'll go like this.
"
47123,"Oh, he is so amazing.
"
47124,"Yeah, I know. Look at him.
"
47125,"Ben.
"
47126,"Hey, Ben.
"
47127,"Nothing. I don't think that's his name.
"
47128,"Oh, look, look, he's closing his eyes.
"
47129,"Oh, look, he's opening his eyes.
"
47130,"He doesn't do much, does he?
"
47131,"Nope, this is pretty much it.
"
47132,"- You guys wanna get some coffee?

"
47150,"Is he just the sweetest thing?
"
47151,"You must just want

47152,"to kiss him all over.
"
47153,"That would be nice.
"
47154,"- Pfft.

"
47164,"I will, really,
"
47165,"I'll pay you back this time.
"
47166,"Where's the money coming from?
"
47167,"I'm helping out at the NYU
"
47168,"Med School with some, uh, research.
"
47169,"What kind of research?
"
47170,"Uh, just, you know, science.
"

"
47172,"Yeah, I think I've heard of that.

"
47179,"It's not that big a deal.
"
47180,"I just go down there
"
47181,"every other day...
"
47182,"...and make my contribution

"
47184,"Hey, but at the end of two weeks,

"
47200,"- Oh, Melanie called. She's gonna be late.
"
47201,"- Oh, okay.
"
47202,"So how are things going with you two?
"
47203,"Is she becoming your special someone?
"
47204,"I don't know. She's, uh...
"
47205,"She's pretty great.
"
47206,"Yeah? What does she think of
"
47207,"your little science project?
"
47208,"You think I'm gonna tell a girl I like
"
47209,"that I'm also seeing a cup?
"
47210,"The man's got a point.
"
47211,"Well, the tough thing is,
"
47212,"she really wants to have sex with me.
"

"
47214,"I still got a week left in the program,
"
47215,"and according to the rules...
"

"
47221,"ROSS: Hey.
"
47222,"How long did you think
"
47223,"this barbecue was gonna last?
"
47224,"I'm going to China.
"
47225,"Jeez, you say one thing and, eh...
"
47226,"You're going to China?
"
47227,"It's, uh, for the museum.
"
47228,"Someone found a bone.
"
47229,"We want the bone,
"
47230,"they don't want us to have it.
"
47231,"So I'm going to try to persuade them...
"
47232,"It's a whole big ""bone"" thing.
"
47233,"Anyway, I'm gonna be gone
"
47234,"for, like, a week.
"
47235,"So, uh, if you wanna reach me,
"
47236,"you can't. So here's my itinerary.
"
47237,"Um...
"
47238,"- Here's a picture of me.
"
47239,"- Oh, let me see.
"
47240,"Could you take it to Carol's now and then
"
47241,"and show it to Ben so he doesn't forget me?
"
47242,"- Yeah.
"
47243,"- Hi, Ben.
"
47244,"I'm your father.
"
47245,"I am The Head! Pahh!
"
47246,"This barbecue's gonna be very fun.
"
47247,"Is Rachel here? Um, I wanted to wish her
"
47248,"a happy birthday before I left.
"
47249,"- Oh, no, she's out having drinks with Carl.
"
47250,"- Oh. Heh.
"
47251,"Hey, who's Carl?
"
47252,"- The guy she met at the coffeehouse?
"
47253,"- No.
"
47254,"- See, there's this guy she met at...
"
47255,"- The coffeehouse? Right.
"
47256,"So you do know who he is. Heh.
"
47257,"I'm gonna go say goodbye
"
47258,"to the guys.
"
47259,"Hey, you know what?
"
47260,"Tell them that bone story.
"
47261,"- Hi.
"
47262,"- Hey.
"
47263,"Hey.
"
47264,"- I have to go to China.
"
47265,"- The country?
"
47266,"No, this big pile of dishes
"
47267,"in my Mom's breakfront.
"
47268,"Do you guys know who Carl is?
"
47269,"Let's see. Alvin, Simon, Theodore...
"
47270,"No.
"
47271,"- Well, Rachel's having drinks with him.
"
47272,"- Oh, no!
"
47273,"How can she, when she's never
"
47274,"shown interest in you?
"
47275,"Forget about her.
"
47276,"He's right, man. Please move on.
"
47277,"Go to China. Eat Chinese food.
"
47278,"Of course, there they just call it food.
"
47279,"Yeah? I guess. I don't know.
"
47280,"All right, just give her this
"
47281,"for me, okay?
"
47282,"Listen, we're just looking out for you.
"
47283,"- I know.
"
47284,"- We want you to be happy.
"
47285,"And I may only have a couple beers
"
47286,"in me, but I love you, man.
"
47287,"I'm still on my first.
"
47288,"I just think you're nice.
"
47289,"Anyway, that's when me and my friends
"
47290,"started this fruit-basket business.
"
47291,"We call ourselves
"
47292,"""The Three Basketeers."" Ha, ha.
"
47293,"Like ""The Three Musketeers,""
"
47294,"only with fruit.
"
47295,"Oh!
"
47296,"Okay.
"
47297,"- How do you like your burgers?
"
47298,"- No. Presents first, food later!
"
47299,"Hold on there, tiger.
"
47300,"How's it going?
"
47301,"How you holding up?
"
47302,"Well, not so good.
"
47303,"She thinks tonight's the night
"
47304,"we're gonna complete the transaction...
"
47305,"...if you know what I...
"
47306,"And you do. Heh.
"
47307,"So, uh, have you ever thought about
"
47308,"being there for her?
"
47309,"What do you mean?
"
47310,"You know, just be there for her.
"
47311,"Not following you.
"
47312,"Think about it.
"
47313,"Okay, I'm guessing this is from...
"
47314,"Well, thank you, Melanie.
"
47315,"- Okay, this one right here is from me.
"
47316,"- Okay.
"
47317,"Hmm. Ah, it's light.
"
47318,"[RATTLING]
"
47319,"It rattles. It's...
"
47320,"...Travel Scrabble.
"
47321,"- Ha, ha, hey!
"
47322,"Wow. Thank you.
"
47323,"This one's from Joey.
"
47324,"It feels like a book. I think it's a book.
"
47325,"Feels like a book. And it's a book!
"
47326,"It's Dr. Seuss!
"
47327,"That book got me through
"
47328,"some tough times.
"
47329,"There is a little child
"
47330,"inside this man.
"
47331,"The doctors say if they remove it,
"
47332,"he'll die.
"
47333,"- Who's this from?
"
47334,"- That's, uh, Ross'.
"
47335,"Ah.
"
47336,"[CLEARS THROAT]
"
47337,"Oh, my God.
"
47338,"He remembered.
"
47339,"Remembered what?
"
47340,"It was, like, months ago.
"
47341,"We were walking by this antique store,
"
47342,"and I saw this pin in the window.
"
47343,"I told him it was just like one
"
47344,"my grandmother had when I was little.
"
47345,"Aw! I can't believe he remembered!
"
47346,"Well, sure, but can you
"
47347,"play it on a plane?
"
47348,"Oh, it's so pretty.
"
47349,"- This must've cost him a fortune.
"
47350,"- I can't believe he did this.
"
47351,"Ross? Remember when he
"
47352,"fell in love with Carol...
"
47353,"...and bought her that ridiculously
"
47354,"expensive crystal duck?
"
47355,"What did you just say?
"
47356,"[CLEARS THROAT]
"
47357,"[SHUDDERS]
"
47358,"Crystal duck.
"
47359,"No, no, no.
"
47360,"The, um... The ""love"" part?
"
47361,"[BABBLES]
"
47362,"Oh, my God.
"
47363,"Oh, no, no, no, no.
"
47364,"That's good.
"
47365,"Just keep rubbing your head.
"
47366,"That'll turn back time.
"
47367,"This is unbelievable.
"
47368,"I mean, this is unbelievable.
"
47369,"I know. This is really, really huge.
"
47370,"No, it's not. It's small,
"
47371,"it's tiny, it's petite, it's wee.
"
47372,"Uh-uh. I don't think any of our lives
"
47373,"will ever be the same ever again.
"
47374,"Is there a mute button on this woman?
"
47375,"I think this is so great!
"
47376,"I mean, you and Ross!
"
47377,"- Did you have any idea?
"
47378,"- No, none.
"
47379,"My first night in the city,
"
47380,"he mentioned asking me out...
"
47381,"...but nothing ever happened,
"
47382,"so I just...
"
47383,"What else did he say?
"
47384,"Does he want to go out with me?
"
47385,"Given that he's desperately
"
47386,"in love with you...
"
47387,"...he wouldn't mind getting
"
47388,"a cup of coffee or something.
"
47389,"Ross?
"
47390,"All this time?
"
47391,"- I've gotta talk to him.
"
47392,"- He's in China!
"
47393,"The country.
"
47394,"Wait, his flight doesn't leave
"
47395,"for 45 minutes.
"
47396,"What about the time difference?
"
47397,"From here to the airport?
"
47398,"Yes!
"
47399,"- You're never gonna make it!
"
47400,"- I've got to try.
"
47401,"What are you gonna say to him?
"
47402,"I don't know.
"
47403,"CHANDLER:
"
47404,"Maybe you shouldn't go.
"
47405,"Right, because if you're gonna
"
47406,"break his heart, that can wait.
"
47407,"Yeah, but if it's good news, tell him now.
"
47408,"Maybe I'll know when I see him.
"
47409,"Here, look. All right, does this help?
"
47410,"No.
"
47411,"All I know is, I cannot wait a week.
"
47412,"This is just too big.
"
47413,"I've just got to talk to him. I've got...
"
47414,"- I'll see you later.
"
47415,"- I love you!
"
47416,"Deal with me first!
"
47417,"[SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
"
47418,"All right.
"
47419,"[SHOUTS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
"
47420,"Ross! Ross.
"
47421,"Excuse me, pardon me.
"
47422,"- Hi. Your boarding pass?
"
47423,"- Hi.
"
47424,"No, I need to talk to my friend.
"
47425,"Sorry, you're not allowed on the jetway
"
47426,"unless you have a boarding pass.
"
47427,"He just went on. He's right there,
"
47428,"in the blue jacket! Can I just...?
"
47429,"I'm sorry. Federal regulations!
"
47430,"All right, um, then could you please
"
47431,"just give him a message for me?
"
47432,"Please? This is very important.
"
47433,"All right. What's the message?
"
47434,"Uh... I don't know.
"
47435,"[SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
"
47436,"Excuse me! Sir!
"
47437,"Excuse me! Sir?
"
47438,"- I have a message for you.
"
47439,"- What?
"
47440,"It's from Rachel. She loved the present.
"
47441,"She'll see you when you get back.
"
47442,"What?
"
47443,"Toby, I don't know
"
47444,"what she's talking about.
"
47445,"There's no Rachel!
"
47446,"Don't give me that deep freeze!
"
47447,"[MELANIE MOANS]
"
47448,"Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey!
"
47449,"I think I blacked out there
"
47450,"for a minute.
"
47451,"It was nothing.
"
47452,"Well, now we gotta
"
47453,"find something fun for you!
"
47454,"[LAUGHING]
"
47455,"Ahh, you know what?
"
47456,"Forget about me. Let's, uh...
"
47457,"Let's give you another turn.
"
47458,"Me, again?
"
47459,"Sure. Why not?
"
47460,"Boy! Somebody's gonna get
"
47461,"a big fruit basket tomorrow!
"
47462,"I gotta tell you, you are nothing like
"
47463,"I thought you would be.
"
47464,"How do you mean?
"
47465,"I just had you pegged as one of those
"
47466,"guys who are always, ""Me, me, me!""
"
47467,"- Ha, ha.
"
47468,"- But you...
"
47469,"...you're a giver.
"
47470,"You're, like, the most generous
"
47471,"man I ever met.
"
47472,"I mean, you're practically a woman.
"
47473,"So, uh, Rach, do you want to save
"
47474,"this wrapping paper?
"
47475,"It's only a little torn.
"
47476,"Are you gonna go for it with Ross,
"
47477,"or should I throw it out?
"
47478,"I don't know.
"
47479,"Thought about it
"
47480,"all of the way there...
"
47481,"...and I thought about it
"
47482,"all the way back and, uh...
"
47483,"You know, it's Ross!
"
47484,"You know what I mean? It's Ross.
"
47485,"- Sure!
"
47486,"- Sure.
"
47487,"I don't know. This is just
"
47488,"my initial gut feeling...
"
47489,"...but I'm thinking...
"
47490,"...it'd be really great.
"
47491,"Oh, my God, me too!
"
47492,"Oh, we'd be like friends-in-law!
"
47493,"The best part is you already
"
47494,"know everything about him.
"
47495,"It's like starting on the 15th date.
"
47496,"But it would be like
"
47497,"starting on the 15th date.
"
47498,"Another good point.
"
47499,"No, I mean...
"
47500,"At the 15th date, you're already
"
47501,"in a ""relationship-y"" place.
"
47502,"You're committed.
"
47503,"Huh.
"
47504,"What happens if it doesn't work out?
"
47505,"- Why isn't it working out?
"
47506,"- I don't know, sometimes it doesn't.
"
47507,"Is he not cute enough for you?
"
47508,"Does he not make enough money?
"
47509,"- No, I'm just...
"
47510,"- Maybe there's someone else.
"
47511,"Is there? Is there someone else?
"
47512,"- No, there is no one else.
"
47513,"- Then why the hell...
"
47514,"...are you dumping my brother?
"
47515,"- Wha...?
"
47516,"- Hey, big...
"
47517,"- Shh!
"
47518,"[WHISPERS]
"
47519,"Spender.
"
47520,"She's still asleep.
"
47521,"- So how'd it go?
"
47522,"- It was amazing.
"
47523,"You know how you think
"
47524,"you're great in bed?
"
47525,"The fact you'd even ask
"
47526,"shows how little you know me.
"
47527,"Well, it's like,
"
47528,"last night I couldn't do the thing...
"
47529,"...that usually makes me great.
"
47530,"So I had to do all this other stuff.
"
47531,"And the response I got! Man, oh, man.
"
47532,"It was like a ticker-tape parade!
"
47533,"Yes I know. As it happens, my room
"
47534,"is very close to the parade route.
"
47535,"It was amazing, and not just for her.
"
47536,"Uh-uh. For me too.
"
47537,"It's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind...
"
47538,"...but all my other senses
"
47539,"are heightened.
"
47540,"You know? It's like,
"
47541,"I was able to appreciate it...
"
47542,"...on another level.
"
47543,"I didn't know you had another level.
"
47544,"I know. Neither did I!
"
47545,"- Hey, great skirts! Birthday present?
"
47546,"- Yeah.
"
47547,"- From who?
"
47548,"- From you.
"
47549,"I exchanged the blouse you got me.
"
47550,"Well, it's the thought.
"
47551,"Doesn't Ross' flight get in
"
47552,"in a couple hours?
"
47553,"At gate 27B?
"
47554,"Uh, yeah.
"
47555,"Monica, you know,
"
47556,"I've been thinking about it.
"
47557,"I've decided this Ross thing
"
47558,"is not a good idea.
"
47559,"- Why?
"
47560,"- Because I feel...
"
47561,"...like I wouldn't
"
47562,"just be going out with him.
"
47563,"I would be going out with all of you.
"
47564,"- Ugh, there'd be all this pressure and...
"
47565,"- No pressure, no pressure!
"
47566,"Nothing has even happened yet
"
47567,"and you're already so...
"
47568,"I'm not ""so.""
"
47569,"I was a teensy bit weird at first...
"
47570,"...but I'll be good. I promise.
"
47571,"[DOOR BUZZING]
"
47572,"Who is it?
"
47573,"CARL:
"
47574,"It's me, Carl.
"
47575,"Come on up.
"
47576,"Behind my brother's back?
"
47577,"Is the kind of crazy thing
"
47578,"you won't be hearing from me.
"
47579,"- Seven hundred bucks.
"
47580,"- All right, you did it.
"
47581,"Do we have any fruit?
"
47582,"[CHUCKLES]
"
47583,"Man, hell of a two weeks, huh?
"
47584,"You know what, though?
"
47585,"I really feel I learned something.
"
47586,"So you'll stick with this
"
47587,"""it's all for her"" thing?
"
47588,"What, are you crazy?
"
47589,"When a blind man gets his sight back,
"
47590,"does he walk around like this?
"
47591,"I'm just saying, if I see one more
"
47592,"picture of Ed Begley Jr...
"
47593,"...in that stupid electric car...
"
47594,"...I'm gonna shoot myself!
"
47595,"Don't get me wrong. I'm not against
"
47596,"environmental issues, per se...
"
47597,"...it's just that guy!
"
47598,"I can't believe you'd rather
"
47599,"go out with him than me.
"
47600,"Excuse me, please.
"
47601,"I'm trying to have a date here.
"
47602,"Fine, just stop thinking about me.
"
47603,"Can't do it, can you?
"
47604,"So I'm thinking about you.
"
47605,"So what?
"
47606,"I don't get it. What do you see
"
47607,"in this guy anyway?
"
47608,"Well, he seems to be
"
47609,"a very nice guy.
"
47610,"I mean, come on, buddy!
"
47611,"Get a real car!
"
47612,"Rachel, come on. Give us a chance.
"
47613,"- Ross, it's too hard.
"
47614,"- No, no.
"
47615,"Because it'll get weird
"
47616,"for everyone else?
"
47617,"Who cares about them? This is about us.
"
47618,"I've been in love with you
"
47619,"since the ninth grade.
"
47620,"- You're, like, my best friend.
"
47621,"- I know.
"
47622,"- If we broke up, and I lost you...
"
47623,"- Whoa.
"
47624,"Why do you think we'll break up?
"
47625,"Have you been involved with someone
"
47626,"where you haven't broken up?
"
47627,"No.
"
47628,"But it only has to happen once.
"
47629,"You and I know
"
47630,"we are perfect for each other.
"
47631,"Right?
"
47632,"So the only question is:
"
47633,"Are you attracted to me?
"
47634,"I don't know.
"
47635,"I mean, I've never looked at you
"
47636,"that way before.
"
47637,"Well start looking.
"
47638,"Wow.
"
47639,"Exactly!
"
47640,"And you just know
"
47641,"I'm gonna be the guy...
"
47642,"...caught behind this hammerhead
"
47643,"in traffic!
"
47644,"- Right.
"
47645,"- Heh.
"
47646,"You're right.
"
47647,"- You know what?
"
47648,"- What?
"
47649,"I forgot, I'm supposed to pick up
"
47650,"a friend at the airport.
"
47651,"I am so sorry. I'm so...
"
47652,"If you want to stay
"
47653,"and finish your drinks, please do.
"
47654,"I'm sorry, I gotta go. I'm sorry.
"
47655,"But...
"
47656,"Excuse me! Pardon me! Excuse me.
"
47657,"I'm sorry. Ha, ha.
"
47658,"Toby, for God's sake, will you let it go?
"
47659,"There's no Rachel!
"
47660,"- Oh, hey. I got that.
"
47661,"- Oh.
"
47662,"- Thanks, sweetie.
"
47663,"- No problem.
"
47664,"I cannot wait
"
47665,"for you to meet my friends.
"
47666,"Really? You don't think
"
47667,"they'll judge and ridicule me?
"
47668,"No, they will. I just, uh...
"
47669,"- Can't wait. Heh.
"
47670,"- Can't wait.
"
47671,"Come on, they're gonna love you.
"
